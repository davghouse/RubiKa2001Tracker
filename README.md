Rubi-Ka 2001 Tracker
--------------------

A simple tool to help track progress when pretending to play Anarchy Online from its original release date of June 27th, 2001.

Latest release [here](https://github.com/davghouse/RubiKa2001Tracker/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

The tracker starts on June 27th, 2001. It tracks play time and advances the (pretend) date by a day when a configurable number of hours have passed. I chose 4 hours as the default "hours played per day" because that seems like a reasonable estimate for what an adult player with a job would've been able to do back in 2001. This value can be edited by hand in the exe.config.

Properly pretending to play AO back as it was in 2001 will be tough. It might even be impossible for some professions depending on how they were affected by rebalancing throughout the years. And of course it won't be possible to recreate all the crazy bugs and server instability. Here are some useful links:
