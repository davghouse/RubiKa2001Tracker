Cunobolen @ 7/3/2002 12:15:22 PM (Failed Ring of Flying-how do I fix it? 35696):
I've had a Failed Ring of Flying for a good 5-6 months (found another two weeks ago).  I've got no idea how to make it, and there's not a "fixed" Ring in the AG database.  Petitioning about how to assemble it or if there's a way to assemble doesn't help, seeing as ARKs can't assist players in any way that would/could help them get an edge on the game.

Any -reliable- help on how to fix it/what materials to use is appreciated.

Darkbane @ 7/3/2002 12:47:47 PM (35696):
Hmm, if its not in the DB... Not everything in the DB is actually in the game, but everything in the game ought to be in the DB.

Seid @ 7/3/2002 12:56:10 PM (35696):
Its just a sell to shop item... or melt-down-to-make-ingot item.

It cannot be fixed.

And dont abuse /petition for things like that :P

Cosmik @ 7/3/2002 1:06:13 PM (Tradeskill sites 35718):
I know there is alot of good tradeskill information out on fan sites. So, in an effort to help gather all the information together, if you want a site to be known, leave the URL here and then I'll put it in a sticky thread for all to see.

Destractor @ 7/3/2002 1:41:58 PM (wow a trade skills board! 35744):
This has to be a good sign for tradeskills in game.

Bring on tradeskills patch 14.6 

Let us make "custom" rings.

Hey a new Forum!

I've just started to work on a weapon smithing resource site.

It's currently based on the 14.0 item database.

But it might be useful anyhow. I'm still working on it.

So have a peek at The Forge .

Thats the most Uber lockpick i have ever seen

Laptop @ 7/3/2002 6:21:11 PM (Empty Instruction Disk... 35805):
I managed to get excited, for a brief time last night, over the empty instruction disk and what I might be able to do with it. I read the description for the "empty Instruction Disk" and it read as follows, "This is an empty instruction disc. Nano Data can be applied to create an instruction disc that can be used for making a Nano Crystal. This is a tradeskill item." I thought wow is it really possiable ot make nano crystals for others from the Nanos I posses? As I played around bought books and managed to get the following message when attempting to populate the EID (Empty Instruction Disk)....

You begin to execute nano program minor Nano Augmentation on:Empty Instruction DIsk.
You can not execute ano program. Target not found.

I am certain thats not quite the exact text but close. Considering th fact I got a message it was attmpting to execute I assume 1) thats the method by which this is done, 2) its a broke process and 3) this question has been posed before. However since I am a relatively new person to the game and we now have this new Tradeskill forum, I am hoping one of FunComs greatest will respond with information on the intent to either fix it or leave it broke. I am of the opinion so many MMORPG's choose to leave so many great ideas for trades broke for various reasons however this is one I sincerly hope does not fall into the category. I see so many entertaining features for the expansion of entertainment in this game just in Trades alone, I am quite certain many have found just as I have that mission become a bore at or around level 70 and many would love to find something a bit on the differant side to occupy their game time, for me this would be one of them.

Thank you, 

Zircote, Clan Agent

Such items (0 cost, no actual use) are usually 'identify' or 'return' mission targets, and I've seen this ring as such.

The empty discs were supposed to be used for the engineer Kamikaze robots, which never made it live.

gnuman @ 7/4/2002 2:22:50 AM (35850):
Left-click the component and shift+right-click on the component you want to combine it with.

Laptop @ 7/4/2002 2:52:33 AM (35805):
Reffering to the Description once again, keeping the mind open, it specifically says for making Nano Crystals. While I understand the Kami Bots may have also fell into its usefullness the description clearly states otherwise.

Rayfield... @ 7/4/2002 6:16:45 AM (35805):
u actually think AO text guys write relevant material on their descriptions?  or up-to-date?  even remotely meaningful in-game at all?

have u tried looking at the descriptions of most of our 'abilities' and 'skills'?  u should.  they're a funny read.

Shatai @ 7/4/2002 7:14:41 AM (35805):
It'd be nice to be able to do though.  Perhaps one for the Suggestions forum?

You cast the nano on an Empty Instruction Disk, or shift-right-click the nano's icon on an Empty ID, and if you have enough Nano Programming (or some other trade-skill or combination of trade-skills), you end up with an Instruction Disk for that nano.

Cunobolen @ 7/4/2002 11:28:31 AM (35696):
Well, I guess 'UP and AWAY!' is better than nothing...it would still be great if they'd let you fly though...

xyberviri @ 7/4/2002 12:09:51 PM (35805):
To make a Kamakazi Bot you must first Build the Acutal "Bot" then use the Holo Camera on the bot to make a 3d image of it, then you use the calculator on it to get the algorythim which can be used to program the crystal.

Then you can Summon the Shell and activate it.


you need to build the shells roughly at ql 40 or 140 depending on what you're producing.

one for the Chemical Bot and the other is a Fire Bot

iv'e been able to make the "Liquid Explosive Charge" needed for the bot but i haven't been able to put them together to make the Complete Liquid Explosive needed. that might be a bug

also iv'e never found a A Basic Mechanical Motion Drive needed to make the body of the bot, beyond that the parts are in the games database but that doesn't mean there ingame.


Here is what the empty disc is specifically used for in the process 
"Use a hologram camera and take a 3D snapshot of the Template Robot. Use a Calculator to convert the data, from hologram- to nano building data. Transfer the Nano Data into an Empty Instruction Disc"

Heh wanna know how to make the Arul Saba Bracelets ^.^

Kissysuzuki @ 7/4/2002 12:29:21 PM (35770):

Someone posting actual game related information on the board!

Interesting too. 

presumably you need one of your trade skills up to do this sorta thing?

Checked your site out. Good info!

Thanks

Mephala @ 7/4/2002 1:30:02 PM (35766):
Nice, but those info are available on virral.clansupport.com

Anyway, the idea is good only problems is that 90% of the recipes are utterly broken since a few months and FC does not seem to care at all about it.

I strongly believe anyway that they were not broken accidently but on purpose by FC.

One day a weapon was working the next day (after a patch) it was not working anymore (Disafilition sniper is an example).

i think the Mausser never worked since I begun the game.

Well the few weapons that are working are craps that no one wants. I have created an Engineer to built stuff but atm I have totally forgotten the idea and never go in tradeskills departement except to get clusters (well not only but you get the point)

zimmy @ 7/4/2002 1:33:09 PM (Make LLT's something you could create with tradeskills? 36013):

Figuring out is fun to me. At least when I don't HAVE to figure it out . So my suggestion for this forum is, don't post recipes. 

Instead, if you make an item just post it can be done and maybe a link to antiguardians' db. Maybe some hints about price, availability of components/materials/instructions, skill requirements and such.

Really hope this forum doesn't turn into a cook book.

cristine @ 7/4/2002 7:11:05 PM (35770):

Saruzi @ 7/4/2002 7:29:23 PM (36076):
Agreed, I like figuring out tradeskills I and try to improve a lot of stuff, and I may have spilled stuff in the past...but I can improve.

Saruzi @ 7/4/2002 7:32:05 PM (Experience!!! 36081):
Experience for most current trade skills is still rather low. I'd like to see it raised so maybe you could use tradeskill to get a level without the need to be fed a thousand items from a high level person.I'd just like to see the xp raised slightly, and I can see how people think this is an exploit, but it people want to break their hand doing this, let 'em! The amount of clicking required is a lot so the tradeoff is okay. C'mon people! Cheer for Tradeskills!

Saruzi @ 7/4/2002 7:33:07 PM (Implants --- 36082):
How in the heck do you take out the old clusters? I know you end up destroying them, but I've tried the screwdriver and got stumped - and they said it was in game I think. Anybody know?

Isembard @ 7/4/2002 8:55:34 PM (36082):
You need to talk to your friendly neighbourhood fixer .

A hacked NCU surgery clinic (think that's what it's called) is a fixer only item which does the job - the clinic itself is made by hacking a surgery clinic (with a hacking tool) and installing an NCU disassembler unit (again, from memory) - only available from the Fixer 'store'.

The clinic comes in a rather vile shade of mauve........

Not always, they do sell guides for 80% of this stuff in-game, plus everything you can't make, there isn't a guide for. There are a few exceptions, but none too signifigant

Biowoman @ 7/5/2002 6:34:35 AM (36081):
Hey please funcom !!
Yes the only way I see the vision of your not having to fight much classes.Ie me a doc who puts no ip in fighting skills at all... yes by choice.., 
I want to level or at least Make decent exp for the effort I put into the tradeskills.
So since light blue is my color for b&e I set most solo (really not alot I die easy) missions, to hidden and stealth for more chests. Since I seem to make more exp from being a thief/Doc. DUH???
There something wrong with that. Fixers and agents should make more exp from breaking and entering because of who they are .
I should be better at making stuff docs use and need.
And also why do metaphysicists get better pharmacy buffs than I do. And for my alt an NT MAT crea/Time space. what is that??

time to use logic.

cold @ 7/5/2002 7:25:39 AM (36081):
I don't think this will happen. Why ? Well, simply because you can't die when doing tradeskills. There is absolutely no risk at all. I hope I don't have to explain why that is bad 

(PS before you flame me, my li'l trader is tradeskill-oriented )

caljeriko @ 7/5/2002 7:50:58 AM (how does the parts decide the ql 36171):
i got a weapon receptable or what its called and i bought the missing part. but the part is a little lower ql than the unfinished gun part, will that lower my ql of the gun? i tried to buy a higer ql part but it wouldnt let me combine them( giving me a message that i didnt have the skill)

/cal

Plasmatorch @ 7/5/2002 8:10:13 AM (36081):
Welll yes you can't die form tradeskills but I think you should be rewarded for putting the ip into them. just like in real life you get a college degree you get paid more in money and experience over some guy who just finished high school and wnet to work. Also knolledge has a funny thing about it that when you have greater knolledge you gain knolledge faster.

just one case I want to bring up just the other day I was told that since I have no combat skills and the fact that I have very little hp ( stopped putting ip into body dev at lvl 15) that I was worthless to a team since I cannot "tank" with the best of them. Sadly this has become the mindset for the tradeskill classes since you get absolutely minimum xp from tradeskills and maximum xp from killing mobs. Something shoudl be done to more even things out.


Oh and reality before you go and start flaming me for not knowing what I am talking about you should read my post in Rk1 exchange.

phil @ 7/5/2002 9:00:47 AM (35744):
I love tradeskillin' unfortunately theres a level cap, and even though I am level 96, I have the same skills I had at level 80, so Im useless.

gah, why do level caps exist? they suck so bad.

cold @ 7/5/2002 9:13:21 AM (36081):
Don't worry I won't flame you 

There is a reward for most tradeskills. Invest in pharma to make good money from monster parts. Invest in nano programming and you can make implants (for money). Invest in just about everything else and you can make nano crystals, including rare creation-only ones. Money is the reward for tradeskills, not xp, and I personally think it should be that way.
And yes I'm happy that creating nanocrystals is now actually cheaper than just buying them 

But you're right, you can't be both effective in tradeskills and combat at the same time. I hope they fix your pets soon so you can bring something there too, that should solve most of this problem (for engineers anyway).

cold @ 7/5/2002 9:18:12 AM (36081):
Note : I am not against higher tradeskill xp, I like doing tradeskill things myself. I just don't think it'll happen. So, somebody come up with a good reason to increase tradeskill xp

Cz @ 7/5/2002 9:33:19 AM (36081):
As said, there is a reward in the trade skills allready, besides the XP, but we are adding it to the list to see whether we can get an official reply about XP on trade skills.

Aristaeus @ 7/5/2002 9:50:19 AM (36171):
In this case the gun will be the ql of the part you use.
Might want to get the higher ql part and a friendly engineer around to build the gun.

coldwarkid @ 7/5/2002 10:18:51 AM (36081):
The monetary reward is there at high levels, where many items are either rare, prohibitively expensive or can only be made by players using tradeskills, but at lower levels the incentive isn't so great. The honourable exception is pharma tech, since this enables you to make blood plasma which sells back to the machines for good money. However, nano-crystals and item creation are a bit of a bust, since the demand isn't there. As a result, you'll still make most of your money from missions until you're at a high enough level to make something that people really want and can afford to pay for.

A couple of cases in point. I'm making low-level nano-crystals right now, mostly as an exercise to remind me to keep my tradeskill levels up. No-one seems to be interested in items they can buy from a basic supermarket and it seems that cash is tight enough for most players at these levels (sub 25-ish) that they're constantly saving up for specific items and have no money to spare on anything that isn't absolutely critical. Yes, you could get lucky and meet the right person with the right crystal at the right time, but it's unlikely.

Secondly, I'm halfway through building a Mauser Chemical Streamer. Problem is, it's QL 22, and I'm going to have to sell it for at least cr10k if I want to break even. Most fixers at that level don't have that sort of cash to spare, so even though it's a very nice, sought after item at higher levels, there's no reward in building the thing at lower ones. There may well be someone out there who'd be willing to pay for it, but the chance of finding that person through the shopping channels without resorting to spamming them may be politely described as "slight". The upshot is that the Chemical Mauser is probably going to cost me money.

If we're going to use the "monetary reward" argument for tradeskills, there needs to be a better means to reach the market than the current system of shopping channels. A bulletin board, rented shop space, whatever. Otherwise, there's no real incentive to use tradeskills at lower levels apart from curiosity, and that doesn't last forever.

Cheers,

~R~

coldwarkid @ 7/5/2002 10:24:08 AM (36171):
Are you certain? It doesn't seem to be working that way for my Mauser conversion. Instead, the QL of the weapon at each stage seems dependent on the QL of the "base" item (in this case a Mauser Particle Streamer).

Sorry to muddy the waters,

~R~

Darkbane @ 7/5/2002 11:50:04 AM (36081):
Yes, the issue of how to sell stuff relates to a number of other areas, including mission rewards, the perceived necessity of clicksaver, etc.

There are a few threads on this and related areas around.

Check:

There are posts scattered about these threads that relate.

What we're really talking about here is how the entire AO economy works (or doesn't), that's the heart of the matter.

Laptop @ 7/5/2002 12:04:21 PM (35766):
Heh, quite frustrating. I am relativly new to the game decided to spend a fair amount IP in Weapon Smithing not to mention a bit of cash only to find that of three recipes I have attempted they just dont work. My question to FunCom is this, have you any intention to test, address and fix these issues or will they be left to be a constant irritant to your paying customers?

Lisje @ 7/5/2002 12:09:31 PM (36076):
While I can partly sympathize with your point, I for one find my innate frugality kicking in even when its only 'virtual' money.  Plus, until you have at least one character at rather high levels, you simply will find yourself sacrificing armor/weapons/nanos/implants for trade skill experiments, and many of us (like me) would appreciate access to this at lower levels.

Personally, I would narrow it to a few main issues that can hardly be called cookbook, since I don't believe they are well-addressed in-game.

1.  Non-consumable equipment - How does quality level come into play here?  A QL10 Gem-cutter will work on any gem, but the same isn't true for the wire extractor - I believe you are limited to double the QL for those, but it varies by device.

2.  Compatibility - as we all know, nano-clusters can be a much higher QL than the implant, but the reverse isn't true.  What component is the limiting factor on QLs for other trade skills?

3.  Working recipes - you don't need to post the exact formula to simply state this can (or cannot) be created currently, and possibly the skill level at which it can be accomplished.

4.  Availability - is this component in stores, or loot-only?

Hmm, I'm probably forgetting something here, but its a start.  On a related note, as a returning player, have they fixed tutoring YET?  It seems to me that would do more to revitalize a trade-skill community than anything else they could do, with the possible exception of a trade-skill specialized channel in addition to the normal "shopping" ones.

Neph @ 7/5/2002 3:00:50 PM (35766):
OK. I've run an update against the newest version of the item database. I unfortunatley cannot update the site with it yet. Will be done sometime next week.

But...

Quite a number of construction manuals have been updated and some (all?) of these now work!

The following have been changed across the whole ql range:
* Blackened Blaster
* Disaffiliation Sniper
* Suppressor
* Notum Staff
 
They've changed the way the process is described (shift-left-click the manual) - you can tell if you have a new manual by looking at the following:
* less spelling mistakes
* there is now a space after the name of the item to be added
* no skill for the first item
* the low and high skills are separated by a '-' instead that a '->'

So FC is obviously addressing the problem, and we can hope for further updates in following patches!

Jayde @ 7/5/2002 5:25:24 PM (36081):
Why, technically, trade-skills are "no-risk"...I still don't think that should matter. If someone wants to put all their IP in tradeskills so that they can level via putting crystals and armor together all day, I say let them.

Even if this doesn't happen, I'd love to see tradeskills get at least a *little* boost in XP. My wife's char puts together implants for people constantly, but really doesn't get much out of it. =(

Dharien @ 7/6/2002 5:46:15 AM (Main problems with trade skills 36367):
Every game has implemented trade skills with varying degrees of success. AO's system could be one of the better ones but there are so many damn problems with it..

AO's trade skill system is crippled by:

1) QL of components. From nano clusters to pharmatech components there is absolutely no consistency. None, zilch, nada! Everything is completely random based upon the range of the store. While this is initially 'kinda neat' and a teensy bit realistic, it can take quite a long time to find the right items for a single combine. 

Set these up like the augmenter shops.. fixed ql in ranges.

2) IP investment. Combining items, as had already been stated by others, yeilds very little in the way of xp.. especially in comparison to the costs of many of the items involved. This results in having to kill to level to get the ip and who really has the ip to 'blow' on tradeskills? Very high level folks who get curious or want to make the extremely high end stuff. 

Perhaps there needs to be a second look at how trade skills are learned and progressed? Just some ideas, maybe lowering IP cost of all trade skills by 50% or more... removing title caps on trade skills.. maybe a one time IP investment and gain skill through use..? Just ideas.

3) Costs. A great deal of the items involved are incredibly expensive and 'core' devices need semi-regular upgrading inflating it even more for items that have no real market.

4) Broken recipes! Broken recipes! Broken recipes!

It's very hard to find the right people to get some needed things made and there is little incentive to get new people into trade skills. A handful of items are in demand.. all of high ql. 

The methodology is fine and there is alot to work with, a bit overwhelming probably to fresh eyes, but there needs to be some serious work done.

schma @ 7/6/2002 2:06:35 PM (Coffee machine 36419):

I've tried the chemicals sold in the tradeskill booths (had high hopes for the clorich acid), and they don't work.

I heard this was broken pre 14.2. Anyone know if you can do the next step now, or if it's still broken? 

If it's working now: what is the magic ingredient?

Xeni @ 7/6/2002 5:50:22 PM (Tradeskills and the flaws of the current inventory design 36439):
Tradeskills vs inventory design:

FC have said they are looking into the tradeskills these days to make those more fun to use. That is good. 

I will write some about my experinces with tradeskill here. 

As an agent, tradeskills isnt Xeni's
strongest side as an agent, she has opened and completed around 100
receptacles of QL200 alsaqris, QL200 chriones SMGs and QL51,QL101 and QL151
soft pepper guns. This is good and shows it possible it could be worth to
invest in tradeskills. The process to complete a receptacle is very simple,
but from my expirences(with this simple process) i could really feel the
flaws of the inventory and bank system we now have. If  more steps is added
to a tradeskill process, these problems would be just even more stronger. Like with the process of making crystals out of discs, which i had the opertunity to try the other day, when i build some of the new adv and fixer nanos for my noobs. 


I therefore have some suggestions below to improve the inventory desgin, which i
think it will make it easier and more fun to do tradeskill, and also easier
for players to start do tradeskills for the first time. Adding more
tradeskills as you do now is good, but i feel the current inventory design
will gag those new additions somewhat and not give them the imnpact they
could have.

-The possibility to resize inventory, bag and bags windows.

-The possibility to acsess your bank as it was your inventory. The vicnity
rules for the bank should still apply and would limit the use of the bank
anyway.

-Make different categorys of items go to its own part of the inventory/bank.
In the first palce a nano pylon have nothing to do with armor or
brontoburgers. Therefore put weapons into weaponfolder of inventory,
tradeskillitems goes to the tradeskillfolder etc. This is what i think would
improve tradeskill most as it would be alot easier to organize and save
tradeskillitems for later or emergency use. With current design of inventory and bank you
very fast lose control over your inventory and its hard to find items fast
if you have forgotten where you have those.

-Search and/or a sort(on name or QL) function. If you dont know how a item
looks its very tiresome to shift-leftclick all items in 20 bags or more,
especially if they also is in bank.

-Possible to rename bags. Bags that only takes tradeskillitem, that carry
twice as many items as normal bags.

-tradeskill chat channel beside as the shopping channels. for questions and
people looking for people with a tradeskills.

-nano craystal shopping could been made alot easier if the uploaded icon also had been somwhat refelcted in the crystal-icon.


Think i had some more ideas, but cant find them. Think they are in a bag in the bank somewhere 

My conclusion: (/me knocks the table with a screwdriver) the current flaws in the design of the inventory and bank system limits somewhat the fun and practical use of tradeskill.

Lisje @ 7/6/2002 5:50:57 PM (IDEA - Tradeskill chat channel 36440):
I mentioned this briefly in another thread, but the more I think about it, the more sense it makes.  There are several reasons why this would help make tradeskills more viable.

Currently people wanting plasma converted, implants made, or any of the less common tradeskills are limited to shopping or /ooc where their requests are frequently drowned out by the other items for sale.  The same holds true for people offering services - they must try to monitor those channels and sift through endlessly scrolling lines of text.

Also, since many components are simply random "junk" loot to the majority of players, they are rarely offered for sale, even though a craftsman may want them.  If there was a specific channel for these items (instruction disks, weapon components), I'd venture to say the low-level versions may become more available.

As another benefit, since many items require multiple skills in order to be crafted, it would provide a forum for players to find 'teammates', so they could specialize in one trade and still create items by co-operating with another specialist.

AO has stated they intend to improve (or at least balance) tradeskills, this forum seems to indicate that, an in-game channel may be an simple early step toward that goal.

Xeni @ 7/6/2002 5:56:26 PM (36440):
LOL 

i made just the same suggestion in the post i posted at exactly same time as you. Must be a message from the notum energy fields.

At first I thought you were suggesting more inventory slots, but simply being able to re-size the window is a great idea and would make working on projects which need several items and tools at one that much easier.

These are excellent. My bank's currently full of carbonrich rock, social stuff (burgers, iced coffe etc.), weapon kits, tools, instruction discs, semi-completed crystals...

If I could put all of these things into different sub-folders, it would make life so much easier.

You'd still have the problem of too much chat drowning out the channel, although it would be an improvement and perhaps encourage a few more people to advertise in this way. Perhaps bulletin boards, either in public spaces or in the shops (or apartments - at last a real reason to go there ) might work better?

I agree. Just overlay the crystal icon over the casting icon, and it'd make it a lot easier to find what you were looking for.

Does anyone know if you can get the hide needed for this armor off of any Bronto, or do you have to find some special ones?

I've been butchering every bronto I come across but I haven't found any hide yet. . . .


Also, what determines the QL of the armor?

They are chest loot in missions too.

Distortion @ 7/7/2002 5:37:07 AM (36171):
For weapon receptable, the part determine the ql.  If the part is lower than the receptable, the finished item will be the ql of the part.

MCS process is different as the last step (plate) is not available in high ql from shop terminal.

Slipstar @ 7/7/2002 5:48:44 AM (armor 36546):

Well I've been getting LOTS of bronto hides off of the young brontos at the Oasis in Newland Desert. It's NE of the Newland City side of Wikey Valley.

Cyrian @ 7/7/2002 7:40:08 AM (36419):
I just got ahold of the part as well, it's been opened, no lcue what to do now though...  any info appreciated.

Krneki @ 7/7/2002 8:55:07 AM (36171):
The MCS creation works the same way as Implant cretion. Higher the skill, the higher the QL jump.

Improving weapons with a MRR results a 0.15*QL higher QL weapon.

For receptacles the missing part dictates the final QL

For building weapons from scratch, the construction kit dictates the final QL.

That's useful information, thanks. Time to show my ignorance now - what's an MRR?

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 11:59:46 AM (36439):
I have been workin an aweful lot on Trade Skills and specialised on Nano Crystals for now. I have found that the biggest problem I have had since the last patch is that the nano crystal components don't stack. I don't know how hard this would be to do but I just wish that all the trade skill items would stack like the generic ring templates.
     As for the bank... I agree with what you have put so far!! Realising that these changes may not be high on the priority list I have cobled something together for now to help me. Anyone that has seen the AO:Chat PERL script at AOQuest will know that this allows you to logon to the chat server. I have written a bot that can recieve and interpret the blob that is sent with a clickable link and allows you to catalogue your bank into a database (through SQL) now this is rather lame in my opinion as it is very time consuming. But I cannot think of a better way of doing it.

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 12:35:22 PM (36081):
I would also like to see more XP for doing trade skills. But!!!!

I am currently working on the possibility of making my own shop. I have written a bot and it will allow users to search my stock and then buy from me at a set price, but back to the point. 

In preperation for this I had asked the guild to gather as many discs as possible. The other day I went through these and in a couple of hours had gained over 500K XP. OK so at level 83 this is not an amazing amount of XP to gain in say 3 or 4 hours. In fact it is really quite low. The discs were QL 4 to 130ish with the majority below 50. All I did was create the PPPE and not the whole crystal. 

The but is how much XP should we get for something that as pointed out has zero risk for the person involved. Not only that but the crystals made give you double your investment back.. I base this on the cost of the disc being what you would get if you were to just sell it to the bank and the cost of buying the consumerbles; then selling the completed crystal to a vedor, so this is really the min profit you can expect as selling on the market would do alot better (I mean ALOT!!).

So for no risk you get some XP and double your money back at least. So would more XP be justified?

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 12:41:26 PM (36521):
I have found some off of the bronto momas in Broken Shores.

Now that is a utility that would be worth having. Beats the hell out of clicksaver, in my book. Can you give us any more details, such as how it works from the POV of the seller or the buyer?

As for XP - because there are really no tradeskills you can use at Lvl.1 barring B&E and Trap Disarm, you'll have to go through the levelling process to some degree before you can set up in business. You also need somewhere to get your startup funds from. I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, especially since you don't need to gain too many levels before tradeskills become quite practical. Once there's a way to practice them without losing money, tradeskills offer a slow but steady means of levelling, and that's OK by me. It's the current financial impracticality that bugs me more than anything.

Cheers,

~R~  <-- intrigued no end by the shop utility

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 1:13:48 PM (My Own Nano Shop 36593):
OK so I am interested in Trade Skills, one of my main reasons for playing. I am an NT and have the usual sets of trade skill implants and have maxed my NP and CL. 

Well I had looked at nano crystal production every time a new patch came out that affected it. So I found out a few things. First off it took a huge investment in tools  and back when they first came out getting hold of rocks was all but impossible. The market forces pushed up the price of carbon rich rock to insane levels and the only practical thing to do with the trade skill was to compile the TS only nanos.

Things improved a lot when the rocks became common and again I looked into making nanos. A few calculations showed that the cost of the components seemed to follow a square rule between the fixed cost points in the object database, i.e. the items in the database are of QL 1,25,50,75,100,125,255 and have a fixed cost at each of these increasing with the square of the QL between these points. This meant that if I was very careful to use the min QL components that I could make some crystals cheaper than that of the shop selling price... but I again thought that this would only be worth while for the non shop nanos.

With the latest patch the cost of the components is now only 1% of the previous price. This has meant that it is now possible to make nanos for a fraction of the value of them. My new calculations indicate that even if you sell the nanos back to a NPC vendor you will double your money (based upon the value of the disc if you sold it to a vendor and the cost of the consumables).

So I thought that now it would be practical to try and make a shop of sorts. But how do I market my wares?!?

Well many people are probably aware of Helpbot. If not it is a script that sits on the chat server and you can communicate with through the games chat interface. Well I downloaded the AO:CHAT PERL module from AO.Quest and got to making my own! The bot does several things but primarily it allows me to tell it what items are in what bags and where they are in my bank. Then you can ask it to search the database for matches… it also outputs the contents to a webpage.

While doing this I found a few big problems with the current trade skill system, a lot of them are already posted here but, the biggest problem I faced was that the components don’t stack that is I want the rocks to stack, instruction discs to stack, symbol libraries and reflection patterns. It wouldn’t hurt if the finished crystals stacked as well!! I would be happy enough if they stacked like the generic ring that is if you use the stack you loose them all, but you can split them.

I am currently trying to work on putting sections into the shop to allow searches for profession rather than just name and QL.

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 1:25:52 PM (36081):
The bot sits on the chat server and takes text input along with extented info (clickable links).

Here is an example as to how I use it.

/tell tribunalbot mybank add 1 1

This then sets the bank to accept the contents of my bag that I have in slot 1 1

/tell tribunalbot (drop an item in)

just keep giving the items to the bot takes about 1 min cause of the flood protection.

/tell tribunalbot ..

this just lets the bot know I am finnished with that slot

I repeat this for all my sale items.

The shopper then uses the following

/tell tribunalbot nanosearch (lowql)-(highql) (phrase)

the ql bit is optional and the phrase is matched like *(phrase)* so using enfraams would be like doing a search for *Enframs* as all the first letters are in caps and cause of my lazyess  as SQL was having problems with ' (should be Enraam's).

The user is then sent a message containing the first ten matches.

The interface for the shopper is relatively simple the tricky part is the time used in setting up the database and maintaining it. I feel it is an improvement over typing out what items you have but still is not that straight forward.

Couple of questions. I assume bot keeps separate "accounts" for each user. Is "mybank" a constant, I mean, can one user have multiple "banks"?
And search then goes through all "accounts"/"banks", right?

Oh, one more accually . Is nanosearch a keyword? We will get other categories too, yes? And a web version 

yeah, somebody shoot me...

Onaris @ 7/7/2002 9:27:46 PM (36081):
OK..

nanosearch is a command and will actually search the bank for anything that matches what you type. So if I have entered armour into the database this will also be found.

I forgot to mention that the search term is also optional as just specificing the QL range will return the first 10 items in that range.

There is only one database and all items for all characters are stored in one table of that database.

The bot does other things such as online tracking of players and information  on the guild and any orders issued (this bit in beta).

The nanosearch function is a off shoot from a system I wrote to allow all guild members to track their bank contents.

There are other commands for searching your own data:

/tell tribunalbot mybank search (search phrase)

will search the the table of items that you entered.. that is although all the data is in one table you only get to search items that you put in.

The nanosearch command is the same command as mybank search except it uses my username for the search and so you are infact searching the items from my bank that I have chosen to put on sale.

As far as the web bit goes you can view some test output here

http://www.onariz.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/nanobank.html

I have also posted some stuff in the thread about my own nano shop.

Special secret message to EtanTaylor:

I'm not looking to buy your coffee machine. 

I want to know if the tradeskill process has been fixed, so that the rest of us can complete the partially built coffee machines we already have.

I don't know if the coffemachines works yet. If not, that is another thing that needs to be fixed, in addition to the building process itself.

I have a partially built coffeemachine, I want to complete the building process, and I'm doing it out of curiosity, and because I hate it being incomplete.

Sorry to spell it out like this, but it seemed hard to convey this message through tells.

Plasmatorch @ 7/8/2002 12:14:24 AM (36593):
sorry onaris I hate to burst your bubble but there is a more detailed process to creating nano crystals. it involves about 5 different tradeskills and if I remember right 3 of them are dark blue for an NT. though and Engineers and traders can make nano crystals all they want since just about every tradeskill is green. 
God I love being an engineer 

oh and if you want to check out the process invovled in making a nano crystal try this site
http://virral.clansupport.com/
it is virrals site. On it  there is a guide to Nano crystal creation in the guides section and tells you what skills are needed to create a full nano crystal.

Onaris @ 7/8/2002 2:23:25 AM (36593):
I am aware of the full nano creation proccess but the  rock > ore > bank > prepared crystal side of things uses only one consumable (the crystal reflection pattern) the three other skills in question are light blue to an NT and so worth considering once you hit your title caps. Although I personally work with a fellow guild member that is an engineer to do this. The stubling block has always been the cost of the consumables which is now soo cheap I don't even bother getting the lowest QL possible.

Sredni @ 7/8/2002 9:03:33 AM (36419):
lol, weird. I didn't even know coffee machines were makeable . I know about the coffee blocks you can get in the specialty stores, but I always just shrugged off their presance as just some quirk, a thingy with no purpose.

can u tell me ( or us ) how u have tanned it plz ?

schma @ 7/8/2002 12:03:18 PM (36419):
This is what little info I've gathered so far:

* get a container from smugglers den (pilot, I think)

* open it (requires bomb disarm)

* hack it (requires break&entering)

* break the seal ( no clue, this step has been broken for several patches )

* mystery steps ( I'd guess at something similar to the crat suit forms )

* you got a coffee machine

* "program" the coffee machine by adding one of the two types of blocks.

* make coffee =)
 - one type will give a tiny mod to psy/sta

Until they fix the process, only one machine exists on Rubi-Ka. It was given to a player by an ARK, as a prize at an event held at Reets several months ago. Judging by my (somewhat confused) conversation with that player, the finished coffee machine does not work yet (does not produce coffee). 

So what we need is:

* fix the broken steps in the building process
* fix the machine to actually produce coffee

this is not like Ebay or Playerauctions, etc...you bid using your in game credits, at end of auction its deleivered to you you give redits...jeez

Yeah, check the site before using your Ignorance to post.

Its just like using shopbot of just holding your own auction by spamming the shopping channel.

Though I do feel that it should get more press as I am sure lots of people don't know to go there and check for stuff.

this  is NOT the same as e-bay, though Man the price I saw when I checked did surprise me a little.

59 mill so far  :O

Krneki @ 7/9/2002 5:55:01 AM (36931):
They can't make like that, because NTs don't have any skills that are higher or skills that are otherwise ignored by other professions.

ouzzelle @ 7/9/2002 7:54:51 AM (36546):
theres a few steps,

1.) pay around 1hundred million creds (not joking) for the Pre Programmed Particle Emmitter Shape Hard Armor

2.) Combine it with a ql 150ish Mass Relocating Robot (sold in shops) that gives you  MRR Shape Hard Armor

3.) Buy some Carbonum Steel Plates from the shop (at the desired ql, 1 plate per piece of armor you want)

4.) Just a guess, never tried it before...:  Buy an Etch-a-Sketh Head/Gloves/Arms/pants/etc.. from the shop,    use it on a peice of Carbonum Plate

5.) then use MRR Shape Hard Armor on the Etched Carbonum

---I think i may have steps 4 and 5 backwards... never done it before so don't blame me ;P---

yep.. that's all folks.

goodluck

Arul Saba isn't in the game, as far as I can tell.

Search for e.g. 'Dodga' on Antiguardians' itemdatabase. You get the Dodga items, his attack-skills and so on.

Search for 'Saba'. You get the Arul Saba bracelets, but no attack skills for Mr. Saba. If he's in the game, he has to have attacks. The lack of attack-items means he's not there.

I don't know exact process, but currently a mass reallocation robots are cheap, if you compare them to how much people are asking from the Pre Programmed Photon Emiter Hard/Soft Shape Armor. Current price range is between 40.000.000-50.000.000 credits....

Wait until emitters are more easily available. And there is book in shop that tells for you, how you craft armors.

Kuro @ 7/10/2002 6:13:33 PM (36931):
NT's need help but not from giving them more tradeskills to make. Engineers and Traders are more suited in theme and skills for most tradeskills. Possibly Doctors as well because nano rechargers use treatment skill.

NTs are supposed to be the masters of nano damage, not nano everything. Personally, NTs being suited for implant creation tradeskill smells su****iously like a fluke. The process is more Insert Cluster A into Slot B than it is anything else.

Ewol @ 7/10/2002 7:40:47 PM (36076):
Lisje, tutoring devices were fixed some time ago - they are self use only (you can't buff others ) but the effects are quit nice.

I am level 59 at present, my tutoring is somewhere around 180-200 I believe and I can buff trade skills by +10 with the devices. That's all from memory, I could be wrong on the figures but lets just say that tutoring is well worth it now, especially at high levels.

Now, who wants to give me a free Pioneer pack for that tasty +150?

Kuro @ 7/10/2002 7:48:17 PM (General Tradeskills Suggestions 37376):
Ah...Finally someplace to campaign for something I want to do more of 

Tradeskills in MMORPGs have huge potential. They give people something to do as a break from all the killing. They help keep the economy healthy. They even help players to secure slots in teams guilds. But AO's tradeskills are under developed to fill any of these roles. So here are a few suggestions I think would help tradeskills immensely:

 Less tradeskill weapons or more variety in their appearance.

Weapons will always be prone to choices based on damage output. With so many non-tradeskill weapons having high demand, there's little reason to want a tradeskill weapon. Not with the current implementation. If 10 new tradeskill shotguns are added to the game, chances are high that only 1 or 2 would actually have any demand. If that many. So new tradeskill weapons would have to be signifcantly better than non-tradeskill weapons (which would invalidate most the existing tradeskill weapons if the processes work), have comparable performance and 'style points' to increase demand, or for the moment adding new tradeskill weapons should be abandoned until the old ones are fixed and balanced against non-tradeskill ones. More tradeskill 'everyday' items.

Weapons and armor are great but there are many items people would want if they were craftable. Almost anything that could be placed in a HUDx/Utilx slot. NCU memory, NCU belts, Scopes, ect. Anything that people regularly upgrade in QL as they progress through levels would have a natural Demand if someone could make those items. The ability to extract more 'base' components from raw materials.

Right now if you kill an animal mob, you have a chance of getting animal parts. If you kill a robot mob, you have a chance of getting robot junk. Both of these items can have other useful items extracted from them (blood plasma and nano sensors). But that's where it stops and it shouldn't. Why not be able to extract chemicals from animal parts to be used in another process? Robot junk could have many other potential components extracted from it besides nano sensors. Why not smelt it down for plasteel or other metals? It was a robot so it had ncu memory. Why not be able to extract the components for making NCU items from it? I can understand why after BBQing a mob with nukes and shooting it full of holes, it might not have armor that's usuable. But it could still drop something from which raw materials could be extracted. That's why salvage yards buy cars that don't run anymore. There's still value in the raw materials that can be pulled out of the car, down to the point of melting it down for the base metal. Different tools used on the same item could yeild different components. With more base components, you open up more possible final products. That equals variety, which people want. More social items or the ability to alter some existing ones.

People will kill over that coffee maker when it starts working properly. But I'm a Texan. I wouldn't mind putting together a working Still or Home Brewery for some booze in my apartment  And I'm pretty certain every Yalmaha owner would worship the ability to change its color. I know, the more 'new' looks added mean more load time. But would creating 7 new yalmaha objects (for the 7 basic colors) and 7 single charge objects that did nothing more than switched the current yalmaha object for one of the same QL but different color impact things that much? Make the objects tradeskill (need mob parts for color, nano bots to change the yalm's surface hue, a delivery system, ect) and you can control how often people switch them around. Even make some colors rare.  More modifications to existing items.

My trader on RK1 has all three Improve Weapon MRRs. But the number of items and types I can improve are severely limiting. Tradeskills aren't just about creating a new item from scratch. It's also about modifying existing items. The ability to tune existing items up a bit. Even if it destroys the item eventually, like hacking tank armor. More 'different options' armours.

The armour tradeskill has great potential. Armor that people can get in specific QLs will have huge demand. But right now, the way things are headed, there will have to be several different armour types to satisfy every player. Why not a couple different base types, with different options like the sealed weapon receptacles?. Let people make the base armor type using raw materials as it stands. But then once they get to that base object, it can be modified by adding different parts to it. If tradeskill armor is to go anywhere, there will have to be many different types to satisfy the need for the different attribute requirement combos. Only a few people will want Bronto Hide armor because it requires Sta/Int to wear. So allow it to be modified to different base statsby adding a few more components.

Tradeskills have demand not only for the items that are generated from them. But also because they offer people a break from constant killing while making them feel productive. It doesn't have to yield an alternative to killing in order to level. But every MMORPG needs things for people to do besides killing and still feel like they accomplished something with their time. And they help keep the economy healthy.

Ok, this is what you need in skills to make a complete nanocrystal, and they are not low or few, hehe... Currently I can only make QL135 nanocrystals selfbuffed at level 124.

Formula Code
NP/CL: 4x
NP: 4.25x

Physical Crystal
ME: 3x
ME/EE: 3.75x
ME/QFT: 4.25x
EE/QFT: 4.5x

The Final step
ME/NP: 4.5x


Shortly you need ME/NP, EE/QFT 4.5 times the QL of disc/rock and CL: 4 times the QL. For a QL212 disc (Last Word) u will need about 955 ME/NP/EE/QFT and 848 CL.... huff a meg

Davitger @ 7/11/2002 11:14:59 AM (36081):
I've been reading about the wanting more xp for tradeskills and you say why should we get more when there is no risk.. well, there maybe no risk but it does take time and does take lots of skills especially for crystal making.. (5skills to be exact). I have a trader that is mainly trade skills and because of this I have a hard time getting teams to lv my poor little trader.. she does 200 damage on average maxes at 900 for the crits that I get once in a blue moon and she is lv 71 right now.. I think if you put the time in it the reward should be higher.. yeah you can sell the crystal and make cred.. but I don't like to do that.. to me the point of making the crystals is to help lower the cost for people to get them.. I sell all ql's that I can make for 1-5k each.. knowing I can sell them for 100k or more.. but I did tradeskills to help others.. cause hey if I charge 100k for the crystal's I wouldn't keep getting the disc for free.. and as for the time involved... Have you ever done it without help from org members or friends.. It can take you 3 hours just to get enough disc to fill one pack plus you have to go get the ore .. and then you can actually put the thing together which is another hour or 2.. for one pack or disc.. for me to get/make them myself It can take around 7 hours we really should get more xp for doing tradeskills.. I a little over an hour at 8x8 with a team and gained 4lvls .. yet I spend 5 or more hours making crystal's and I'll be lucky to gain one lv.. well that's my 2 cents worth

Talion Atley @ 7/11/2002 12:26:06 PM (Why can't we mine? 37532):
I've been playing Project Entropia (a new mmorg that is currently in test stage) and  I've mined like I've never mined before.

Then the question pops up. Why can't we mine here in AO? Ore could be used to create armor, weapons and other nice stuff.

My personal opinion is, that mining is a needed aspect in any mmorpg.

Octo @ 7/11/2002 12:26:15 PM (36440):
Good idea...

But please have a lvl difference thing on tradeskill channels too. No highlevel guy will unmute a channel where people constantly is looking for 200 NP or something. There should be atleast 2 separate chans. So the real tradeskillers actually can monitor them (For those with skills at 700+ for example).

Talion Atley @ 7/11/2002 12:32:12 PM (36081):
Another solution could be dividing the skill and XP tables up. So that the XP you gain by using tradeskills,  can only be used to improve tradeskills.

This solution is argument against the risk-reward discussion, because a tradeskill user wont be able to use the skill points in combat skills.

Octo @ 7/11/2002 12:34:18 PM (36593):
I would strongly advise NOT to allow stacking of rocks, discs, reflection patterns and so on....

You could easily exploit stacking of such items to lvl a lowbie many many lvls in a relatively short period of time (50 lvls in 5 hours maybe?). This was done some time ago by people who sold chars and stuff on ebay for a living. 

In fact, if rock stacking worked I could write a program, with a nice GUI so that any n00b could use it, in a matter of hours.

So.. do NOT allow stacking of tradeskill-related materials/components please!

*EDIT: Fixed a comma and a bad sentence.

Maximilian @ 7/11/2002 2:28:41 PM (Ring prices have dropped 37556):
Anybody a clue? Maybe some official statement on this (that I missed).

I don't know exactly which patch it happened (14.2 or 14.4) but I manufactured a large number of silver and gold rings in 14.0 (7 bags full of stuff) and did some statistics.

In 14.4 I came back with some more bags and I had to recognize, that prices 'for rings' had dropped about 1/3:

- before 14.4: ql51 golden ring with perf. cut cold stone = 12.5k
- 14.4: ql52 golden ring with perf. cut cold stone = 8.6k

It is tedious and time consuming to make rings, even if you are prepared (cutter, reclaimer, wire drawer, furnaces and ring templates). It is a 6 step process to make rings and why on Rubi-Ka did you cut down the reward even further?

Am I the only one, that recognized? Am I schizo?

So long,

Vermeer

Oeloff @ 7/11/2002 2:48:23 PM (37556):
I was a little curious about this myself though I haven't investigated.  What I'm gonna try next is wether or not selling the ring and the stone individually would earn more creds than if I assemble them.  From what I've seen, there doesn't seem to be much improvement in value.

Hinesbra @ 7/11/2002 3:21:13 PM (37381):

There may be a reward in trade skills besides the XP, but it needs help which is why people are asking for more XP reward. The majority of tradeskills are currently weapon related which is subject to player demand. Of all the weapons possible to build, there are only 1 or 2 worth considering using. Not because of anything like damage or recharge time. Simply because, only 1 or 2 would match my skill set 

So if item created is supposed to be part of the reward and every player out there is faced with the same consideration (200+ different weapons & only 2 usuable by them), then we're forever stuck with this reality: The majority of tradeskill items require alot of time in aquiring components yet has little appeal to anyone simply because they can't use it.

More ordinary tradeskill items, that have uses for everyone, are needed to make the item reward worth the time/ip investment.

Tarage @ 7/11/2002 7:42:20 PM (37381):
The numbers aren't exactly 4.5, but they are very good to go by. I tell people the same formulas when they ask me how much skill is required. I think the multipliers are actually 4.5 exactly for a QL100 nano, but lower than 4.5 for under Ql100, and more than 4.5 for over QL100. 

For a Ql212 nano though, the last two steps require about 967 EE and QFT, and then about 997 NP and 955 ME. 

I have never been able to accurately determine what the formula is. So the ones Krabbus posted should be fine to base your numbers off of.

Kuro @ 7/11/2002 10:30:19 PM (37609):
Maussers have been working for I dunno how long.

Kolt 58s and Kolt PDWs worked.

Sleekblasters (all types) worked

Triplejolts worked.

Those are the only ones I've ever bothered with. The biggest thing though is you've got to be really careful with the QL of the components and the order of assembly for QL ranges of the finished weapon. A lot of people think they're just like implants and can use a QL 150 piece for a ql 23 gun. And while weapons of the same type all use the same parts, the order of assembly changes according to QL. You prolly know this stuff but a lot of newbies don't.

coldwarkid @ 7/12/2002 12:06:11 AM (37609):
Actually, I just followed the steps in the manual. Parts varied in QL from 4 for the energy weapons kit for the beamer, up to 40 (max for the shop) on the same weapon. I take it that parts above this level might cause problems, then?

Hard to tell. I don't have credits to burn trying to verify it does break a construction kit if you use a QL component outside the range specified by the manual. But I do know using the wrong order for that QL range weapon will break the construction, despite the kit accepting the components in any order that's valid for constructing a weapon of that type. So it always made sense to me to follow the manual's requirements to the letter before saying it's broken 

It's a really quirky system. You can try assembling a Cast Off Minigrinner like it's a Ill-Treated Minigrinner and the system will let you...right up to the point where it breaks

This is in reference to the thread:

Weapons Manuals - what works, what doesn't and where it's broke... 

I didn't want to de-rail the thread.

There are 410 weapon manuals in the database... and just because one ql of a weapon kit works, doesn't mean the others will. I know this because I've tried various ql's of MPS kits, some work, others failed.

I applaud your efforts tho.

I'm too low for that high QL - I can only do up to QL135 selfbuffed... but Tarage is a Trader and high-level so perhaps you should ask him... hehe

/me wonders why traders are better at making weapons than an engineer

Krabbus @ 7/12/2002 7:29:16 AM (37678):
Take a look at The Workshop - Jewellery guide - there u find the tools u need and they are a bit expensive if u don't have the cash. For a long time ago I bought myself a set that cost between 50k and 100k and it sure have paid off.

You have to be careful what kind of stone you are combining with your ring, never use Spring Crystal (?), it's almost worthless I think... The ring should also be of gold if you want much for it.

I'm not sure what it pays you, but I think a QL60 ring gives u around 10k and a QL100 ring gives you around 25k - 30k, I'm not quite sure...

Onaris @ 7/12/2002 7:29:37 AM (37678):
Well to make Jewellery you need:

Tools:
A gem cutter (only comes in QL 10 and is cheap)
Precious metal reclaimer (again QL 10)
A Wire drawer (all QLs and you need a high QL on to do high QL stuff, can cost a bit)

Consumerbles:
Generic ring template (one QL and only 20 creds each)
Personal Furnace (again one QL and about 200 creds)

Skills:
Agility
Mechanical Engineering

ok take any gem and use the gem cutter on it and ta da it now perfectly cut gem. This is worth alot more when sold to shop.

Take any precious metal containing item, most rings and bracers, including things like IQ rings and reflect bracers, and use the extractor on it. This results in a silver/gold/platinum ingot.

The ingot is probably worth less than what you just melted down . But using the personal furnace then placing that in the wire drawer gives you filgree wire. The wire is still worth less (not worthless, just worth less than the starting item).

Now using the wire on a generic ring template gives you a silver/gold/platinum filgree ring. These are often worth more than the item you melted down.... but there is not much in it.

The real bonus of making a ring is that you can then combine it with a cut (or uncut but the perfectly cut ones a worth alot more) gem. The final QL of the item is that of the ring while the gem you combine with it can be lower in QL following same rules as cluster into implant. This final item is worth alot more than your starting items (as long as the ring was >= QL of gem).

I did this for a while as an NT but came to my senses and did a skill reset that avoided ME and I never really increase Agility either.

I found that if you have high ME and agility then it is always worthwhile to perfectly cut your gems as this doubles their sale value to the vendors and is really straight forawrd needing only one tool.

If you can be bothered building up a stock of filgree rings and then setting the lowest QL gem in them will really increase the value of the items. The value of items varies to the square of their QL so combining a perfectly cut ember QL 100 with a QL110 gold filgree ring, which makes a QL110 perfectly cut ember mounted on a gold filgree ring will give a large boost to it's value, a very large boost in deed.

Hope this helped you decide whether or not to take it up!! Even if a bit long winded

Krabbus @ 7/12/2002 7:32:41 AM (37556):
I hope you know that different shop terminals can give you different prices...

Thanks, Krabbus for the hint.

I am aware of the fact, that (as Omni Engineer) I will get best prices at Omni terminals, followed by neutral ones and clan (hihi).

Do you mean, between the individual Omni shops are differences? Hell, what consequences.

I will test this as soon as possible.

Both times I am refering to I sold in Omni-1 trade.

Before patch 14.2 or 14.4 it was like this, I always tried several shop terminals inside one shop to see if there was different prices - not sure if it's like this now because I haven't got the time to test it.

In my midlevels I lost a lot of cash because of this strange bug when I sold bloodplasma to the "wrong" shopterminal...

Krabbus @ 7/12/2002 9:19:24 AM (37678):
... buy the tools/ring templates in the tradesection of any shop, if you are Omni you can find the shopterminals for tools at the left side of the tradesection, and the ring templates in one of the last terminals at the right side...

coldwarkid @ 7/12/2002 10:12:06 AM (37659):
Hey, I never said it would be easy 

In any case, at the moment I'm limited to making only the low-level kits. I reckon if I just keep ploughing through them as I go up in level that I'll be able to cover a good proportion of them over time. Hopefully, other people will chip in now and then as well (thanks Kuroshio).

Finding information seems to be the most difficult thing for any tradeskill professional. We all "know" that the kits are bugged, in fact I've heard estimates that 85% are broken. Accordingly, I wasn't expecting either of last night's efforts to work, and was rather surprised when both of them did. A definitive list of working/broken kits will do two things: make it easier for the devs to fix what's broken, and make it easier for tradeskill users to get something out of their profession.

Cheers,

~R~

Maximilian @ 7/12/2002 10:27:27 AM (37556):
Well, this is most valuable information and most probabely a bug as well.

I have a few bags of jewelry collected again, by now. Time to make some rings and test this - sigh, there are more than 20 shops in trade, aren't they?

So long,

Max(imilian)

Krneki @ 7/12/2002 10:49:29 AM (37556):
Selling in different shop has been changed a few patches ago. You don't get more/less cash depending on the terminal you sell to, but your alignment.

Also, your comp lit afects price of stuff in the terminals. You psychology should afect prices of items sold by NPCs, but it doesn't, it depends on your comp. lit. Which is IMO a bug, but no1 is bothered by it

Maximilian @ 7/12/2002 12:37:06 PM (37556):
-> Krneki: Hi Boss (as an OT Engineeer I consider the Profs as high rank superior  ).

Serious.

'All shops same price.'

If it is so, and I see no point to doubt this, than FC has dropped the ring prices significantly. -> bad, very bad. Did the ring prices really imbalance the game economics???

Maybe you could put this on one of the next lists you hand to the community team.

-> CompLit. Was always wondering, why I get such good prizes at the Advanced Medical Supplier in Clon**** - explains a lot.

I did analyze a large amount of rings and gems (raw), as well as cut gems and silver and gold filigree rings.

The over all summery before 14.x looked like this (ql 60):

Average ring: ~2.1k
Average gem: ~2.1k	-> cut the gem (increase value by factor 2.5)

Average cut gem: ~5.6k

we add 2.1 +5.6k = ~7.7k for a cut gem and an untreated ring

The skilled Engi (and some other professions as well) buys some tools, extracts the ore, melts it down, forms a new ring from it and adds a cut gem on top of it - well 6 mouse clicks later:

Silver filigree ring with cut gem: ~11k
Gold filigree ring with cut gem: ~17k

Made a profit of ~43% for the silver ring plus XP, not great, but attractive enough for me to do it, and
a profit of ~120%  for the gold ring plus XP - reasonable (in my eyes).

Right now it looks really bad: I got ~7.5k for a ql61 silver ring with cut gem  and ~11.6k for a ql61 gold ring with gem.

As a matter of fact, you don't earn anything by making silver rings atm besides 3k XP for a ql60 ring (well) and the prices for gold rings have dropped to former silver niveau. 

If you have a chance, Krneki, could you ask some official sources if this was intended or an uninteded side effect. With this change ring making will become much more uninteresting than before.

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.S. I will do some more analysis, when I find time for it. I find ring making so 'artistic' and peaceful.

No its a lot simpler than that

Rings were one of the few things Engineers could be good at (FC: Cant have that = nerf)

Rings were a tradeskill (FC: Cant have tradeskills interrupting the level treadmilling = nerf)

Sad but True

Onaris @ 7/12/2002 2:43:32 PM (37556):
From what I have seen you seem to get 1% discount for every whole 50 pts of comp lit so if your comp lit is say 440 you get 8% and at 460 you get 9%. Also it seems that at 449 you get 8% and 450 you get 9%. 

The same is true for selling stufff. You get 1% extra for every whole 50 pts of comp lit.

The same goes for psychology, high skills will yield better prices when selling to a salesperson. Where as computer litteracy affects the prices from vendors.

And what vendor you sell to can affect prices further, I understand.

Clan vendor machines allegedly give fewer credits than Omni vendor machines.

NPC vendors allegedly give more credits than vendor machines.

Vendor machines in the different sections of the supermarkets (Trade, Nano, general areas) allegedly give different credit amounts.

The Trader Specialty vendor machine allegedly gives the most credits than any machines.

I hope that was filled with enough "alledgely"s to completely confuse people

Onaris @ 7/12/2002 8:11:02 PM (Selling your skills? 37834):
I would quite often go to trade and sell my ability to make implants. I thought that it was an easy way to make money and worked for tips, sometimes doing freebies for low levels etc.

These days I don't do this anymore as I do missions for money and find them to be much more lucrative. I was just wondering if other peeps still sold their Trade Skill abilities or if like me only do guild/friend work now.

For reference I am a lvl 85 NT and I solo 152 missions for my cash.

More bad news. The Cheap (1-20) and Simple (21-40) MTI Aleph recipes don't work. They get through their respective first steps OK, but fail on the second leaving you with a useless kit. Interestingly, although the components for the first step is different in each case, the component for the second is the same - the Ultra Long Composite Barrel.

Broken kits now outweigh working ones by 5-4...

If Funcom ever lets up make custom nano chargers like we can make health chargers, then I image these parts will be used.  The steps will probably be similar except instead of blood plasma we will add Notum Solution which might be created by using an precious metal extractor on the items and then crushing/grinding the results into a power and then adding the crushed refined notum into a special liquid solution.
Just a guess.  I image they will find other items to use it on, but rechargers is just an obvious first step.

Most of the ranged weapon recipes do work. I haven't yet found a melee weapon recipe that does, though, and some of the MPS recipes (Cast-Off, QL 21-40, for example) don't work.

I've got such a database, and as soon as I figure out how to make a web interface like Auno's got going, I'll put it up for general access.

Naosuko @ 7/15/2002 2:31:48 AM (37609):
I have done a lot of tradeskill work, and I can tell you for a fact that the tradeskill parts do work like clusters. It's only the construction kit that affects QL.

As soon as I get my other computer up and running again, I'll be able to get back into my weaponsmithing database, and I'll get you the results of my testing in here.

Naosuko @ 7/15/2002 2:39:38 AM (37556):
Prices at clan and neutral terminals are the worst.

All non-tradeskill omni terminals buy for 25% over the clan and neutral terminals, and the commerce terminal buys for 50% over the clan and neutral terminals. The tradeskill terminals, for whatever reason, treat you like an unwashed clanner and give you prices to suit. 

This, combined with the complit discount (Hmm, frequent customer adds 55 complit = 1% discount) can really add up.

coldwarkid @ 7/15/2002 11:09:07 AM (38256):
Right now, weapon creation is a bit on the iffy side, because many of the recipes are broken at some step of the process. Also, like the weapons shops themselves, many of the weapons you can build are not really what you'd call uber, or even functional in some cases.

However, if you're prepared to give it a try, the procedure is fairly simple.

1) Purchase a manual for the weapon you want to contruct. Make sure you get one for the appropriate QL range, as the recipe for an ill-treated Uber Weapon isn't the same as for a cast-off Uber Weapon. This step isn't strictly necessary, as you can read the manuals in the machine and write the steps down, but I find it convenient for the trivial outlay involved. Up to you though. The Manuals also list the tradeskill used at each step of the process, and the minimum scores required for a weapon at each end of the QL range.

2) Get a Weapon Construction Kit of the right type and QL. These are from the machines near the stairs in the trade dept.

3) On the opposite wall you'll find terminals selling weapon components. Simply buy each component in order, and apply it to the kit by left-clicking to pick it up and then shift-right-clicking on the kit (as per lockpick etc.). Each component must be at least the QL of the weapon kit, and must be applied in the right order. Often a kit will allow you to apply components in the wrong order, which just results in a broken kit, so be careful with this stage.

4) If all goes according to plan, you now have a shiny new weapon with the same QL as the original kit! If all doesn't go according to plan though, you'll find that at some stage the kit simply refuses to accept the component you're trying to add. The chat window will give you an error message in this case.

If it just says your tradeskills are too low, you just need to raise them somehow. The 20pt general buffs are handy here. If on the other hand it says that the parts cannot be combined, then the recipe is broken. Sorry - throw the kit away and try something else. In a few rare cases, you'll find that the kit has constructed another item entirely. There's a report on the Engineer forum about a weapon recipe that created a first aid kit...


That's probably put you off by now. If it hasn't, please report your results here, as we're trying to compile a list of which kits are working and which aren't.

Send me a /tell on RK2 if you need any help.

Cheers,

~R~

Anything that speeds this process up is extremely welcome. I estimate I've already blown around 15k futzing around with kits etc, which at my level I can ill afford.

I'm going to go out on a limb and assume that kits that worked under previous patches will probably still work under the current one. However, I've heard reports that recipes that were once broken are slowly being fixed, so if it's possible could you list which patch the recipe was tested under?

Lastly, Funcom claims to have a list of known broken recipes. Would it be possible to remove known dud manuals from the terminals, to prevent people wasting time and cash on projects which won't work? Perhaps Cozmik could pass that along for us.

Welcome to wonderfull world of Fubared trade skills of Anarchymissionalldayuniquecampingwelied toyouall Online   by FC

The truth my dear fellow engineer are that those things wich you can  make right are are bad so much so that even  noob would not use them.

And if you want to get a claw  to your MA i would recomed to do a mission for one Hazzarine Claws those are best MA weapons right now.

Also if you want to dream and droll about cool trade skills of Anarchy Online  please go to this url:
http://www.anarchy-online.com/conten.../engineer.html

Or i can save you some time and post here what They said in that link.

"Technology and machines are a citizens best friend and there are no two ways about it. Why, with only a few basic parts and a twist of the wrist, you'll be the proud owner of a brand new custom-made weapon. Learn from me and I won't only show you how to equip your friends and customers with A-grade guns, swords and blunt objects, but I will also show you how to use your skills in the battlefield. The armour your friend, or even you, is wearing is too old and doesn't work effectively anymore? Not to worry! With technology you can increase the statistics of that armour and you'll be grinning from ear to ear. Hey, why not add a shield that damages an enemy hitting it? Sure, there you go. You just keep smiling my friend! That weapon is a little slow? Not to worry! Let's increase its damage output a bit shall we? And let's not forget the embodiment of your friend technology; the droid. Let me tell you, be an Engineer and you'll be the happiest grease monkey there ever was. Say, does that armour need fixing?"


Se those bold words? Well those should be strongest engineer  sides.

Ohhh yeah they are one of few good MA  weapons (hmm in fact when i think now i cant come whit anyother wich you can dual and deal good damage but i bet that there is something else)


Also dont try to wear Hazzarines until your MA skills are past..... hmmm not sure it was 180 or 200. Because that  when you get past that limit you will start to attack whit both claw/s and your fist.
As max you will be able to hit 40times (2 claws + fist) per 1min.

I've got a QL87 Mauser Particle Streamer that I want to turn into an MCS. I just picked up a QL86 compression chamber for next to nothing. 

Can I use this QL86 compression chamber with this QL87 gun? 

When making weapons, do the parts have to be the same QL (or better) as the original weapon?

Or is it like making implants and I can go down to 1QL below my original weapon?

TIA

coldwarkid @ 7/15/2002 4:58:04 PM (38358):
You can drop below the QL of the "base" part by a small amount. I don't know exactly what the numbers are here, but I'd guess around 10% based on my experience with a QL22 MCS which requires QL20+ curved carbonum plating. How this might potentially affect the QL of the finished weapon I'm also not sure.

Better than nothing,

Onaris @ 7/15/2002 5:16:14 PM (Trade Skill Co-Operative 38377):
Co-Ops are a common thing, I don't know how others fair but I a problem with my trade skills. Now rather that complaining about the current limitations and bugs.... I've done that else where ... I am talking about problems I face in making the trade skills worth while.

The situation I am in is that to get ready for some trade skills, install all implants wear right clothes etc etc, is quit alot of hassle for me as is changing back into combat ready mode. So making ten nano crystals takes about as long as 100.

Also I tend to find that alot of peeps don't want to devote that much time to trade skills because of all the hassles. And when I do make all this stuff there is not sufficent demand for the crystals within my own guild and I find that advertising on the trade channels to be hit or miss with so much stuff.

I was wondering if there are any Co-Ops out there. Not a guild but a collection of Trade Skill orientated people that work together. Or if peeps are interested in starting one?

Myers @ 7/15/2002 6:09:01 PM (38347):
I'm pretty sure it is not implemented into the game yet

Onaris @ 7/15/2002 6:10:46 PM (38347):
may I ask where the motion drive is bought?

Also you need to make the robot completely... but then you are not allowed to use it.. some RP stuff about regulations etc.. so instead u take a 3d image using the holocam and this makes some thing you can use witht he blank disc to eventually make the ..... shell crystal.... I go check...

The Secret Revealed - Kamikaze Pets I and II  
Description  One should not overestimate the impact of the Kamikaze robot - the damage it does is a mere flicker compared to the massive blasts of nano energy the nano-technician can produce. Still, for the ones amongst us that does not want to over-specialize in damage; it can be a valuable addition to the arsenal. The following process ends with a nano crystal - only useable by the engineer profession. 
The process of building Kamikaze robots consist of two parts: Construction and re-construction. The construction part is divided into three: Body, Brain and Explosive
For the Body, combine:
- A Basic Mechanical Motion Drive
- A Flexible Shaft
- A Sheet of Curved Carbonum
The parts should be approximately quality level 40 for robot type I and 140 for type II.
For the Brain, combine:
- A Nano Sensor
- A Bio Analyzing Brain
- A Personalization Device
Again, remember that the result should be circa quality level 40 or 140 depending on what you're producing.
The last part is the explosive. Kamikaze Robot I does fire damage, while Kamikaze Robot II does chemical damage. The procedure of making their respective explosive parts differs somewhat. We begin with type I:
Use a screwdriver and remove the conducting wires and protective coat from an ordinary charge of flamethrower ammunition. Mount an Active tube in the safe air vent of the container. Now you have a Liquid Explosive Charge. Assemble two more Containers of Liquid Ammo and connect them to a Key Detonator.The result should be a Complete Liquid Explosive.
For making a Complete Chemical Explosive you only need a Key Detonator, some skill and a Drum of Hydrochloric Acid.
Combine the Body, Brain and Explosive and get a Template Pet. Due to charter LK-901-88 you cannot utilize your robot at this stage. You need to teach nanobots to build the servant for you. Due to the pure technical/electrical material of the robot, this is fairly easy to do:
Use a hologram camera and take a 3D snapshot of the Template Robot. Use a Calculator to convert the data, from hologram- to nano building data. Transfer the Nano Data into an Empty Instruction Disc and voila: You have an Instruction Disc - all you need for starting to make a nano crystal. The process uses the Space library and pattern. 
For further guidance in the art of building a nano crystal, confer the popular 'Book: How To Create A Nano Crystal'. Good luck!

You can use clusters that are 10% lower in QL than the implant, I say 10% to be safe as it doesn't seem to be constant and sometimes seems more like 17%.

Yikes, that's kinda f*cked up.  I hope they boost the power of this bot, or it's gonna be useless.  
I don't understand funcom's point of view regarding pets.  By nature, since pet classes have crap health, crap weapons skills, etc, their pets should be doing massive damage.  The risk however comes when the pet owner is attacked.  Putting the pet owner on the hate list is a good idea.  Maybe even a range limitation so they pet owner cant sit 15 rooms back risk free. not like funcom would ever implement a "good" idea, but it'd be nice.
slayerdroid with 50,000 or so hp.  what good is all that hp when it can't hold aggro?  At least metas have their enmity pets which do WAY more damage than the lousy demon.  It occasionally holds aggro too.  The tradeoff is the enmity only has like 9k hp.  The engis should have a useful pet too I think

Lisje @ 7/15/2002 9:06:50 PM (38377):
Sounds like a great idea, and with the central ICC area now, it could easily be done faction-independantly to ensure enough participation.  From a role-play perspective this works also - a true merchant should be more interested in profits than politics anyway, right?  Or if you see yourself as an artisan, your creation should be the primary concern    

Personally I have characters on both dimensions - clan on Rubi-1, Omni on 2 (felt less like cheating that way) although lately I've been spending most of my time on Rubi-2 since I was inactive during the IP reset and I'm still irritated that I missed it with my Rubi-1 characters which I had first and therefore needed it more.  

Lets keep this post alive and see if someone will organize such an endeavor.  Since my highest chars are 60 & 48, I'm not really in a position to do it myself, but I'd be more than happy to help & spread the word if a time is set since I am online at all hours (chronic insomnia + disability = very random playtimes)

I was trying to develop my own list a couple weeks ago.  This is some of my data.  I gave up when I lost a couple bags of carbonrich rocks and the processing tools, trying to nerf it off onto a character with no developed tradeskills at all.  "That does not belong to you.  You can not pick that up."

Processing Carbonrich rock into Carbonrich ore, need a mechanical engineering skill of 177 for 59, 180 for 60, 183 for 61 186 for 62...210 for 70, 213 for 71, 216 for 72, and 222 for 74.  It appears to stick to a strick (minimum_Skill = QL X 3) formula.


Processing Carbonrich Ore into Pure Carbon Crystals.

skill 198 for 53, 202 for 54, 206 for 55, 210 for 56, 213 for 57, and 217 for 58.  Until that 213 for 57, it appears to follow a formula of (minimum_Skills = (QL x 3) - 14).

Processing Pure Carbon Crystals into Program Crystals is stickier.  skill 178 for 42, 199 for 47, 212 for 50, 221 for 52.  That is the data I was able to collect, and thought to collect, a fortnight ago.

The skill needed APPEARS to be 3.5 from QL to QL.  Appears to be 31+(QL*3.5) for the most part.  But this is broken even within the limited data I collected.

I guess I'm going to have to sponsor a young engineer to get some lower figures to plot with.

Otori @ 7/16/2002 3:53:48 AM (38377):
I take some pride in the IP I've invested in my tradeskills.  I feel a bit more selfless that, as a lvl99 Engi (God, the 100 is gettin close), I can create things that other people can use (albeit, not as much as I one day hope to create, due to broken weapon kits).  I have never been interested in being able to cast the most uber bot, or kill the strongest of mobs.  I am happy to take the backseat in my guild knowing that other members come to me first when they need a rare crystal made or a monster part converted.  That is the role I like in this role-playing game.  

With that said, I would love to have a Co-Op of Traders, Engi, or whatever profession decides to endeavour into Tradeskills.  I'm not going to leave my guild at this point (which is definetly NOT a "Tradeskill" guild).  Being right at the 100 level, I feel I'm doing pretty good that I can build QL105ish crystals (with a few buffs) and still cast a decent bot.  I do wonder what the lvl150-200 Engis are capable of with tradeskills.  Have they long given up the idea of putting IP in those skills, or are there any that can make the QL212 crystals?

Anyway, maybe, just maybe there will be enough interest to propel this idea and provide a valuable service Rubi-Ka wide.  I've actually started working on a script (ex. Helpbot, Auctionbot style) that will allow for inquiry into what Instruction Discs I currently have avaible, and maybe even general quotes on different services.  I dont know if that will actually pan out, but its a start.

I would be happy to spearhead this idea, so reply here or send me a /tell Cophichius in game (by the way, I'm Omni, but agree with the idea of ICC being a perfect place to carry out business).

xyberviri @ 7/16/2002 7:27:12 AM (35805):
just cuz saba isnt in the game doesn't mean you can't know how to make the items. Saba will probally end up being a vendor like Eddie in Stret West. 

I was only stating that even though things are not in the Game its still posible to know how to make them. ^.^

It's good to see that peeps are interested...

I am in a similar situation at being only level 85 and not really interested in leveling fast (got 32days /played on the char )

I am an NT and have specialised in Nano programming, up to about 613 self buffed.

I too have written a script to help in my endevours and if any of you want to try it then send a tell to tribunalbot almost always online.

The shoppy bit is the command

/tell tribunalbot nanosearch (lowQL)-(highQL) (search phrase)

will return the first ten matches from the database.

I agree that ICC is an ideal location and personally I am happy to deal with neurtals and clanners both as members of a co-op and as customers.

The only justice I see in decreasing ring prices is the decrease of costs to make nano crystals.  Don't get me wrong, I learned about ring making AFTER the new patch so I'm crying in my seat at the amount of credits I COULD have made but didn't.    However, I do get a decent amount selling nanos that people "want" . . . well . . decent in ratio of selling the instruction disc to a store.  But even selling the nano to a store is profitable to the amount of credits it takes to make it.  I don't mind the exp either.     Well, that's just my opinion.  Please don't hurt me.

was it supposed to read "i *haven't* found where..."

This new version will allow you to enter which step is broken in any construction manual - or indicate if the weapon can be built.
I've already done some tests, and here are some results:

* Dull Notum Staff
* Ill-Treated Chunkprojector
* Ill-Treated Heavy Grinner
* Irreparable Blackened Miniblaster
* Cast-Off Subturbine
* Cast-Off Sleekblaster Minor
* Cast-Off E-Beamer
* Cast-Off Disafiliation Sniper
* Cast-Off Blackened Blaster Rifle
* Ill-Treated Mausser Particle Streamer
* Cast-Off Suppressor

broken:
* Cast-Off Mausser Particle Streamer
* Cheap MTI Aleph 
* Simple MTI Aleph 99
* Cracked Bolter 42mm
* Useless Triple-Blade
* Rusty Tripler
* Cast-Off Right Slice
* Unbalanced Mini Axe
* Cast-Off Mini Axe
* Low quality Santiago Crossblade
* Cheap Amytlo Executioner
* Refitted Polearm
* Chipped Polearm
* Dulled Thagh Whings
* Dull Notum Spear

Also, Dharien said that the ill-treated blackened blaster was broken. BUT there are 2 different construction manuals for this weapon. One was added in 14.2.2 and the other is older but was still modified for the same patch. At least one of them is broken and they are both sold in the shops.

I even tried combining Silver Nano Circuitry Filigree Wire with a ring template(doesnt work). If I had to guess, some of these new trade-skill items may be for making these rings. If not, we need to find to find the NPC that has the rings before the unwashed masses show up and camp him day and night ^_^.

Neph @ 7/17/2002 9:15:01 AM (38720):
You can use them to make rings and get even more cash.

Same as with a gold or silver ingot you get from reclaiming the metal from existing rings/bracelets.

Maximilian @ 7/17/2002 9:54:42 AM (38720):
finally, they are ql200+, could explain why they are that hard to find.

Our hero!

Would you please give a hint where you found them?

Thanks in advance.

Look for somebody with high Mech Eng skill (Engi, Trader, Adv), he could probable make a 'very' rewarding ring for you (look for an equal ql gem as well).

Then your are a very rich man, BasilF.

They are essential for making armor (trade skill).

Check out the boards (exchange) and sell it (if desired) to a large guild (I would assume 50+ mill).

Do you have some more details - what level of team mission, where, how many, etc. - thanks in advance.

Lucky day, mark it in your calender.

P.S. If you are an Engi or Trader you might consider using it yourself if you can level fast enough - makes even more money.

If you're not into trade skills, you might sell it a good price.

Contact Pkhunter (my boss) or Slashingfred or Venimeux (my chars) or Unclewrangle (guildmate who is often online  ) ingame if you're willing to sell it.

It isn't a hard number.  It's a percentage of the QL of the implant.  Thus with QL 10, you can go as low as QL 9, but QL 200 you can go MUCH lower (in the low 180s).

I hope you know I'm in Ona.

For those who do not know me, I'm a lvl 92 engi, and have pumped a fair bit of IP into tradeskills and I will be devoting the next 8 levels to primarily tradeskills.  I can convert carbon rich rocks into crystals up to around lvl 90 without special implants so give me a tell any time if needed.  I also fix jewelry up to about level 100 without special implants.

Like others I hate having to get out my tradeskill implants to make 2 gizmos and have to run around looking for docs/agents and what not, to put my "battle" implants and armor back on again.

ICC sounds like the perfect place to set up shop, and with people from multiple guilds/factions our clientel should be fair when we get going.

It looks like it gives pretty reasoable protection, but it also adds NCUs and i think extra nano points.

sorry, my spelling is horried, but this armor looking like something an NT would be most happy to own.  And i'd really like to find out more about it.  What it is, How to spell it correctly, and where i can get me some..

I've done a little research with ring prices and I've found some pretty amazing stuff that I never thought existed.  I'll create a new thread so if you're wondering about ring prices, you definitely should go read up on it.

Tatsu @ 7/18/2002 10:39:30 AM (Traders and Ring Prices!  Must Read!  You'll get your money's worth! 38956):
Okay.  There was a recent discovery that FC had lowered ring sales to shops by a decent percentage which upset many ring makers out there (myself included).  However, there was a discussion about whether or not selling an item to different shops made any difference at all.  It was said to have made a difference in the past, but after a few patches, was eliminated.  We were wrong.  Sorta.

Different shops really do effect how many credits you'll receive for all your hard work.  But it's not like you'll get more credits selling to an Armor shop than you would from a Map shop.  For my trader, I've found that it works like this.  With a ring, there is a "normal" price when sold to all the general shops (armor, map, weapons, implants, etc.)  I put normal in quotation marks merely because it's the middle value.  However, if you sold your ring to any trade shop (Electrical and Mechical Components, etc.), you've just been conned, my friend.  You actually receive less credits selling to a trade shop than you would if you just walked a few feet and sold it to the armor shop.

It doesn't end there, there is a plus side.  The "normal" value is less than the past value for rings that were sold to stores, as most of you have discovered.  But it seems apparent that FC truly wishes us Traders to stick to Trade skills.  Simply because you can sell your ring for more credits at any trader specific shop than you can from a general shop.  Reasonably more, especially if you have a backpack full.  

Oh!  Almost forgot.  I did check ring values for every NPC in Omni-Trade and they all buy the ring at "normal" value.  There wasn't a credit difference between any of them.  So NPCs do not give you a better value.

Now, for my evidence:
QL 41 Platinum Filigree Ring w/Perfectly Cut Silver Perl.
Trader specific shop value - 12,570 credits
"Normal" value - 10,775 credits
Trade shop value - 7,183 credits

QL 37 Gold Filigree Ring w/Perfectly Cut Crystal Sphere
Trader specific shop value - 7,829 credits
"Normal" value - 6,710 credits
Trade shop value - 4,473 credits

As you can obviously see, if you've been selling them to the electrical and mechical components shop right after you've made them like I have.  Well, we've been seriously had.  But now that you know there truly is a difference, we will never make that mistake ever again.

Tatsu @ 7/18/2002 10:57:10 AM (38956):

Yep trader shops were very nice when battlesuits gave uber creds.

I guess if I knew more traders then I would sell my rings through them too.

This is how traders should work, you give them an item and they can make more money from it than you!

Problem with rings coming down in price is that engies (the only prof other than traders who are skilled in the process) are making less and less money.

Trade skills used to be a nice way to get the creds rolling in (sinse no one did them for xp), although they are still ok for creds, there are becoming less reasons to increase trade skills at all.

oh well I just hope they make the "custom" rings trade skill only!

I'm pretty sure the value in the DB is the base buying price, ie what it would cost you to buy in a shop if you could. As people have already mentioned, this is modified by lots of things. Selling stuff to a shop of course gives you about 5-10% (not sure of exact figure, but its a pittance compared to buy costs).

Warlock @ 7/18/2002 1:44:27 PM (38956):
Slight OT but here we go

I have a platinum ingot, IIRC this was created reclaiming something (a Ring or power I think) I found on a MOB.

Onaris @ 7/18/2002 3:32:05 PM (37556):
I did some research of costs of items and stuck all the results in an excel spreadsheet, what I found was that if you wanna work out the cost of some QL of an item to buy from a shop then you need the database figures for the cost of the items. Most items in the database have only one or two entries... things like nano crystals that are a fixed QL have one entry and items such as armor have a QL1 and QL200. There are a few items that have multiple entries or end points other than QL1 and QL200.

So once you have the cost from the database for the item you can then work out the equation for the cost at any QL.

this is of the form a*x^2 + b = base cost where x is the QL and a and b are constants worked out from the two known values of base cost and QL.

This then gives you the base cost. This is without any modifiers such as your complit skill or terminals. Comp Lit will decrease the cost of items that you are buying by 1% for every whole 50 pts of comp lit. Omnis appear to get a bonuse 1% on top.

The base value (selling to a vendor) is 1% of the base cost, but this is then raised by your comp lit. 

I did this a while back and it still seems to hold true.

The only importance of this is... maxing your comp lit gets you more money, so it may be worth considering complit implants for shop selling expensive items. The value of items in the game increase with the square of the QL.

Just one more to add this time. The Irreparable Electron-Charged Pistol manual works fine, and frankly it's not a bad gun if you're a low-level engineer or other support class. The crits are small, but the base damage is fine and the weapon's fast, especially the recharge. Only requires two skills to use (Pistol and Fling), uses energy ammo and does damage against Fire AC. I'm using mine myself, and testing out the next recipe up just as soon as I have the 140 weaponsmithing required...

Great! I want to be the first one to thank you for finding this info, I'm always curious about the skills required to do certain tradeskills.

Mercatura @ 7/19/2002 4:47:40 AM (38358):
171 shine, 168 faded for ql200 if I remember correctly.

Easy way to tell, try to combine a ql5 cluster with a 200 implant, it will tell you exactly how low you can go. Works for any imp really...hit a basic store and test before making a full set of higher imps, save you a lot of time and trouble.

Mercatura @ 7/19/2002 4:53:07 AM (38956):
Trader shops have always been nice.

Battlesuits were a huge difference, sometimes I'd buy bsuits from people for 50k 'more' than the shop would give them. I always ended up ahead a couple hundred k.

Still useful even though suits aren't as great anymore.

Run to leet yard, buff for Trading mogul, hop over to trader store and dump all your packs of vendor loot. I get a friend to give me mochams, a little easier. (can't unbuff cast until 190+ I think)

Plasmatorch @ 7/19/2002 6:30:23 AM (38956):
Too bad my engineer can't use that shop just one more reason why to retire my engineer and start a trader. Funcom will be the death of the engineer porefession soon enough:/

Okay, so the constant is 3.75 instead of 3.5.  I'll keep that in consideration.  Thank you.

Anyone can use the clinic to clean the implants. It's just that fixers are more likely to raise BE and have the highest buffs for it, since reqs are 5*QL implant B&E.

Zamolcrat @ 7/19/2002 12:42:54 PM (Advice on starting a trade skill char 39185):
So I just want to make a char that will most likely stay under level 100 (unless I'm just having too much fun with it) just to try out trade skills. I know that they are not all that good and stuff but I'm just curious. So I have 2 questions.

First, which should I pick up: engineer or trader ? I hear many people saying that traders are better than engineers at trade skills(and there are a few threads on these forums about it also) but for some strange reason most of the people who advertise their trade skills are engineers. Am I missing something ? 

Second, which trade skills have the most items that work ? I am not sure if I'll have the ip to raise all of them as I also need to put a little into weapon and nanos as this char has to level also. Thus I might not be able to max all trade skills so I'm curious which ones have the most cool stuff going on for them.

Destractor @ 7/19/2002 1:24:36 PM (39185):
Traders are better at trade skills (with their buffs) than engies (without traders buffs)

If you have traders friends, who can buff you when needed, maybe an engie is the better option.

I believe that the reason engies advertise their trade skills more than traders are that:

1. There are more engies than traders (until you get past lvl120)

2. The description in the prof selection screen suggests that engies might be better at building things than traders (even the name suggests this) therefore people who wanted their prime to be a trade skill guy, chose engie.

3. Traders are probably fed up of having to wrangle people (and have enough creds) so don't want the business.


Well not a lot you can do at the mo, jewelery requires mech eng, but you will be doing it for creds, not to help others. 

Recepitals need B&e and weapon smithing, though they are not all that common.

Nano creaton needs mech eng, elec eng, quantum phy, np and comp lit (quite a few skills) but can really help people from this.


In terms of lvling, if you like team missions then traders are better (pathing sucks) where as hunting is more an engie skill.
Though there are few high lvl hunting grounds so few engies get much higher than 120.

If you are an engie you have to find mps most of the time at higher lvls, where as traders will have people trying to find them, to get wrangles.

So if you want to be helpful and loved be a trader, if you want people to hide fom you become an engie.

Ok then, if anyone can do them, how do I go about doing it and what exactly are the reqs?

...and Schma, I'll give you a tell about 4pm eastern time today.

thx for the help so far and hopefully someone will be able to tell me if and how a doctor could go about doing this themselves w/o any assistance.

At higher levels, Traders get a nice line of buffs for their tradeskills that give them the edge over Engineers. At lower levels, this is less of a problem, since tradeskills cost Engineers slightly fewer IP than they do Traders. Basically, without the buffs the Engineer is better, with the buff the Trader is.

Of course, the Trader can apply the buff to the Engineer...

Nano-programming. Just about everything to do with implants works, so it's a good one to invest in. If you're intending to specialise in it exclusively, you might consider a Nano-Technician or Meta-Physicist.

Other tradeskills are useful for just about anything. Weapon manufacture, for instance, may require Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Nano-Programming or Chemistry in addition to the mandatory Weaponsmithing. Making nano-crystals (again, everything works here) also requires several tradeskills, as do making jewellery and medical gear. Check the guides are at http://www.virral.com for a thorough list. Again, if you're intending to specialise in stims, treatment packs etc. you might consider starting a Doctor.

The only thing that's really broken is weapon manufacturing - just under half the kits we've tested so far are working. Everything else I've tried has worked flawlessly. No one profession dominates in every sphere of tradeskills, so you'll have to specialise to some degree anyway. Pick something you think you'll like and go with it without worrying too much 

Cheers,

~R~

Zamolcrat @ 7/19/2002 2:46:08 PM (39185):
Thanks a lot for the fast answers, guess I'll try a trader then (I'm going to try and engineer also, but not for trade skills).
Btw, my main is an NT which has maxed NP and CL  and making lots of implants

Darkbane @ 7/19/2002 4:49:22 PM (38920):
There are 6 different types of bronto hide, soft and hard, and each coming in small, medium (not shown as such) and large.

Each piece makes 1 type of armour.

You need to tan the hide then use an MMR with the relevant disk (which as you will have guessed by now is the hard part... )

I was all excited I found a Low-Light Targeting Scope and was gonna start critting like mad.  But then I went to go equip it and it said trade-skill item.  After much cursing, I decided to go see what this thing is and what I can do with it.  Are the old LLTS no-longer in-game?  I mean the equippable kind.  I know the decreased the crit increase, but did they also eliminate the scope entirely?

Actualy NTs have one thing.  Sadly, one One thing - that that no other profession gets.  A program that recharges nanos.

So, in that line, one would think that NT would have some way to divert that recharge into an item.  Thier by makeing a "recharger".    

Base it off of Matter Met, Mater Creation, Time&space.  

Or just make it where once its all said and done. - HE has to be run on the "item" to finish it, and turn in into a nano - recharger  Higher lvl HEs turn the item into a Higher QL recharger.  

The NTs would likey need someone to do that actual "work" of putting the fram and such togeather, but the actual recharge would be done by an NT.  (w/ HE or some item depended apons high lvls of Time/space, Matter Met. and Matter C. )

I figure the HE would be the key.  but it might be to much codeing to allow it to target and run on an item.

Must disagree a bit.  Our profession is called - Nano Technician.  not - Nano nuker.  While nukeing and dmg dealing is part of our profession.  By our very name we are defined as *technicians*.

And as a technician, one does more then blow stuff up.  One repairs, one fixes.  By our name, one would believe that We are the "programers"  The ones who while unable to use most profession spefic items.  Does the codeing for said nanos.

the nano Tech, is the one to code the program, edit out the bugs and such.

By the discribtion, Nano tech, have a greater understsanding of Nano programs.  We've learned/understand them so well, we can do things that look like "magic".

As such, when it comes to Nanos - the little itty bitty machines, We shoul dhave the leading edge.  Our whole lives have been dedicated to the understanding and ultization of nanos.

  now becuase of the violent nature of RK, NTs have devoted a lot of time to create dmg dealing nanos.  Because it's what we know best.  Nanos.  Sure high lvl Nts use guns.  But most low lvl folks are dieing for IP if they use anthing but Nano programs.

Dang shame thiers no Technical side of my chosen profession.

Fraid actually, you're mistaken

	
		
			
			
				
"The power to turn something into a smoldering pile of ashes is a great power indeed. It's even better when that power is at the tips of your fingertips. Add to that a ranged weapon of choice, and you'll soon familiarise people with the functions of the reclaim terminal. Either that or sending people running like crazy to escape your wrath. All this and more is the destiny of the Nano-Technician. Our nano programs are able to cover the full range of damage types; from chemical to melee, cold to fire. We will always find a way to damage to our prey, no matter their armor or level of skill. Some people say mind over matter. Well I say mind creates matter. As well as hurling any conceivable type of damage towards an opponent, as a Nano-Technician you will be able blind, root an opponent on the spot, and even prevent them from attacking. By executing programs on youself, your ability in the uses of nano technology will be increased. Matter creates, matter destroys and it is at our disposal as a Nano-Technician."

			
		
	
and

	
		
			
			
				
The Nano-Technician is a highly specialised profession focused on one thing; dealing the most amount of damage to the target in the shortest amount of time. He is all about nano programs, always holding a large variety of damaging nanos in his arsenal. The Nano-Technician also has access to extra programs that enhance the effectiveness of his attacks to a fine and deadly art.

			
		
	
I can deal with having to find an NT to program nanocrystals. But nanorechargers is too far afield. And I really think they should have nothing to do with implants at all. I'd never trust a C++ programmer to create an artifical heart for me

Good point.  but Who do you think wrote the program that lets that hart WORK?  It's not just pumps and weels.  thier is codeing, that had to be programed, to allow that hart to know it should go

Beat  pause  Beat pause.  ect.  insted of Beat, Beat, Beat, pause, pasue, pasue, Beat, pasue. pasue.

someone built the hardware - But the programer was still needed to write the codeing to make it work.

it would be the same w/ rechargers, Other folks can create the hardware

But how are they going to force feed the nano juice into it?  the NTs have learn how to pull energy out of thin air. The Nt s in a way a walking Nano recharger.  (how ever slow it)

 What is a trader going to do? an Eng? A Doc?  

They have no reasonalbe way to justifi putting the nanos it the charger.  The NT does.  They can built the frame, they can create the hardware - But thier going to have to take it to a Nano Tech, to get the NT to tell the nanos - Go here, wait, till needed.

Heh, I think you're overcomplicating it. For example, an artificial heart is just pumps and valves. A pacemaker is little more than a microchip with very simplistic routines (ie: no beat = shock heart) . Tradeskill Stims that do restore nanopoints have nothing to do with nanoprogramming whatsoever. There's no programming what basically boils down to a complicated gas tank to me

As of 14.4, we have two new tools in the Tradeskill armory. 

Shape Soft Armor and Shape Hard Armor.

What would you like to be able to do with these tools in the future?

I want to be able to build bog-standard basic armor. In the QLs I want, when
I want, so I can sell it to other players.

I want to NEVER have to do the "Shopping Terminal 500" just to find some 
bloody Metaplast in a QL I can wear.

Note: If there is anything already in the tradeskill items that you feel
would be appropriate to use in the making of armor, post and TELL ME.
This *will* be submitted to Funcom, in hopes that at least some of it 
could be implemented.


Suggestions:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Leather armor from Pelted Monster Parts. Use a "MTI Leather Pattern 
Machine" to format the Parts, then use the MRR (Shape Soft Armor) on it.

Make Sid's Leather by taking Leather armor and adding a "Heat Distribution
and Management Unit".

New armor: Energized Leather. Take Leather Armor and add an "Energy Shield
Pack". This would raise the energy protection to 50% of the melee protection
and turn the green color to black. Mostly a style thing, but it would make 
Leather not suck quite as much. Should be trivial to do.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Steel Ribbed by combining "Armor Undersuit Matrix *part*" with Plasteel Ribs.
Then apply the MRR (Shape Soft Armor) to turn the resulting "Ribbed Clothing 
*part*" into Steel-Ribbed Armor.

Make the Ribs by combining Plasteel plating with a "Skeletal Construction Kit".

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Make Plasteel Armor using Plasteel Plates from the Armor components terminal 
plus a HSR Etch 'n Sketch and the MRR Shape Hard Armor. This would produce 
"Basic Plasteel Armor *part*". 

Stats: (QL 200 Body Armor)
 Energy ac 875   
 Projectile ac 1000    
 Melee ac 1000   
 Chemical ac 150   
 Cold ac 150   
 Fire ac 150   
 Poison ac 150   
 Radiation ac 150  
 
Basically, this is un-upgraded Plasteel Armor. It should be silver-grey in 
color, but otherwise identical to the other Plasteel armors..

Upgrade to Chilled Plasteel by adding a "Comprehensive Refrigeration Unit".

Upgrade to Heated Plasteel by adding a "Heat Distribution and Management Unit".

Upgrade to Titan Plasteel by adding a "Mk IV Radiation Damper".

Upgrade to Vito's Plasteel using a "Automatic Neutralization System".

It should also be possible to use a Hacking Tool to strip out the upgrade 
and turn any of the Plasteel types back into Basic Plasteel.


New Armor: Enhanced Plasteel

Also, there should be a way to combine multiple types of upgrades into one suit
of armor, but it should be *damn* hard.

Take a "Personalized Robot Brain" and combine it with a "Connective Matrix". This
produces an "Activated Connective Matrix".

Then add this to the Basic Plasteel. (The "Activated Connective Matrix" must be at
least 75% of the QL of the armor.) This produces "Enhanced Plasteel Armor". Same 
protection as Basic Plasteel, but adds an Intelligence requirement. (350 at QL 200, 
other requirements same as Vito's Plasteel.)

Next, add the "Comprehensive Refrigeration Unit", the "Heat Distribution and 
Management Unit", the "Mk IV Radiation Damper" and the "Automatic Neutralization
System". Armor becomes Chilled Enhanced Plasteel, then Temperature-Resistant
Enhanced Plasteel, then Shielded Enhanced Plasteel, then finally Perfected
Enhanced Plasteel.

Final Stats: (QL 200 Body Armor)
 Energy ac 875   
 Projectile ac 1000    
 Melee ac 1000   
 Chemical ac 875   
 Cold ac 875   
 Fire ac 875   
 Poison ac 200   
 Radiation ac 875  

Should take *serious* tradeskill. (I.E., you ain't making QL 200 unless you're an
Engineer or Trader with full buffs and implants.)

Definitely should be some sort of cool color. I recommend glowing purple (like the 
eyes on that one Opifex face.)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Omni-Pol should be hackable.

Take some Omni-Pol (not Elite, as that is *far* too well protected for casual 
hacking).

Apply hacking tool, get "Hacked Omni-Pol". Description states that the auto-ID
systems have been stripped out but the armor is presently damaged and un-useable.

Combine Hacked Omni-Pol with Metaplast Plates.

Produces "Overplated Omni-Pol". Description: This armor has been crudely repaired 
with slabs of Metaplast. Unfortunately, it is still unuseable.

Next, MRR (Shape Hard Armor) the Armor. This produces "Assault Issue/ Recruit 
Issue XXXX-XXX Armor". Is Slate Grey in color and has no Omni Symbols. Otherwise
identical to Omni-Pol Armor.

(Good looking armor, with good stats and lets you taunt the Omni Opressors!)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building Cyber Armor: 

Combine "Skeletal Construction Kit" with Carbonum Plate. This produces "Carbonum
Exo-Structure". Then combine the "Carbonum Exo-Structure" with an "Armor Undersuit
Matrix *part*". This produces "Carbonum Structured Armor *part*".

Next, combine a Nano Sensor (must be 75%+ of the QL of the armor) with
the Carbonum Structured Armor. This will produce "Incomplete Cyber Armor *part*".

Next, run the MRR (Shape Hard Armor) over the Cyber armor, completing it.

To produce Bau, add a "Mk IV Radiation Damper" before MRRing the armor.
Will produce "Incomplete Bau Cyber Armor *part*".

To produce Waitt, add an "Automatic Neutralization Unit" to Incomplete Bau.
This will produce Incomplete Waitt Armor.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Making Low-Tech:
Use a HSR Etch 'n Sketch on Plasteel, then combine the Etched Plates with an 
"Armor Undersuit Matrix *part*". This will produce "Plated Clothing *part*".

Then finish with MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

New armor: Reinforced Low-Tech
Take the Plated Clothing and add it to a "Sheet of Kevlar Weave".
Stats: (QL 200 Body Armor)
 Energy ac 900   
 Projectile ac 1125    
 Melee ac 1125   
 Chemical ac 150   
 Cold ac 150   
 Fire ac 150   
 Poison ac 150   
 Radiation ac 150  

Looks like Low-Tech armor, but black and white instead of earth tones. 
Very good basic protection, and gives us another cool looking helmet to use
with other suits of armor.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kevlar Armor:
  "Sheet of Kevlar Weave" Plus MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tech Armor: Dunno. Ideas most welcome.

 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Light Combat Armor:
 Produce a "Carbonum Structured Armor *part*". Finish with MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

New Armor: Shielded Light Combat Armor
 Add an "Energy Shield Pack" to a "Carbonum Structured Armor *part*". Produces 
 "Shielded Carbonum Structured Armor *part*". Finish with MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

 Produces Shielded Light Combat armor. Identical to normal Light Combat, but it 
 has Energy AC equal to it's Projectile AC.

Energized Armor: 
 Take a "Shielded Carbonum Structured Armor *part*" and add a "Mk IV Radiation 
 Damper". This produces "Incomplete Energized Armor *part*". Finish with MRR 
 (Shape Soft Armor).

Raven's Energized:
 Incomplete Energized plus a "Comprehensive Refrigeration Unit". Produces 
 "Incomplete Raven's Energized Armor *part*". Finish with MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

Link's Energized:
 Incomplete Raven's plus a "Heat Distribution and Management Unit". Produces
 "Incomplete Link's Energized Armor *part*". Finish with MRR (Shape Soft Armor).

. . .that they will become more common and I will be submitting this with that thought in mind.

Holy: I want to keep this as basic as possible for a first submission to FC. Let's get them used to the idea of us useing tradeskills instead of Clicksaver or the Shop Terminal 500 before we get into further suggestions.

Mercatura @ 7/20/2002 4:03:45 PM (39315):
Have them actually drop on disc form, and drop from solo mobs like the q/10/20/30 weapon MRR discs do. Then we can worry about more uses.

Onaris @ 7/20/2002 6:22:32 PM (39315):
Kenlon,
           Lots of great ideas there and all I was thinking was maybe where you were suggesting adding things like "Comprehensive Refrigeration Unit" to modify the basic armor types to the modded that maybe it would be better to just use clusters. I know it only a minor thing but anything would make it easier to code would help get it implemented. Also was thinking that maybe for the cyber armor rather than having a new skelatal thingy maybe use the implants as the basis for the cyber armor.


Also on side note should there be an uber armor. Like maybe heavilly augmented nano armour. Built from a full set of implants and carbonium plating that gives a limitied benifit of the implants plus extra protection? Make it trade skill only but easy to get the pieces and hard to put together. I mean real hard. So that it would take a few poeple to make it.

Onaris @ 7/20/2002 6:26:32 PM (Hansen Personal Ore Extractor 39424):
Hansen Personal Ore Extractor     what this for?

I assume you use it to make this

but then what that for?

coldwarkid @ 7/20/2002 8:01:29 PM (39424):
It's part of the lowbie Living Cyber Armour quest which you get from the Good Times Party Mixer. I assume it's for one specific scenario, but if anyone alse has found any other uses for it, please let us all know.

Warlock @ 7/21/2002 12:04:15 AM (39424):
While that one is part of the living cyber armour body section mission I'm pretty certain a 'normal' version exists which is neither special or nodrop (no I'm not refering to the full blown ore extractor). IIRC personal ones were introduced in 14.4 as a cheaper alternative to the full blown ones to make nano crystal creation cost effective at lower levels (where is has previously been cheaper to buy the complete crystal).

I have the one from the mission (dont know if it would normally be deleted on completion since I used it from a backpack) but I havent been able to see if I can use it outside the mission as I dont have any rocks to try it on.

Warlock @ 7/21/2002 12:28:10 AM (MRR QL Question 39472):
Ok so we know that disks/PPPE for the MRR all have fixed QL levels but does anyone know if the QL of the MRR used has any relevance to the operation?

i.e. If you combine a QL60 Armour PPPE with a QL60 MRR can you only do up to and around QL60 armour or can you do the any QL?

(no I dont have the armour PPPE)

Appreciate any info

Hello there, all.  I'm sort of new to the Forums here.  This will, in fact, be my first post.
Not to sound too STUPID during my first post...but I was wondering where I get this item called a 'Key Detonator'?  I can get all the other parts (Motion Drive excluded of course), but I have been unable to locate this one.  Is it sold in the shops?  Do I need to take something apart to get it like with the Nano Sensors?
Any help would be much appreciated.  Thanks in advance!

You mean the Jensen Personal Ore Extractor. Doesn't cost too much (I've got one, and I'm dirt poor most of the time) although I can't quote exact figures off the top of my head.

I haven't tested the Hansen on conventional carbonrich rock, so I don't know what it would do, if anything. If anyone on RK2 has one of these and wants to give it a try, send me a /tell and I'll sort you out with a fragment. You'll be doing me a favour - my bank's overflowing with the wretched stuff...

secondkenlon @ 7/21/2002 1:14:08 AM (39315):
Some interesting ideas here.

I didn't want to use implants/clusters in making armor for two reasons: Implants are *too* *damn* *expensive* to be useable in making armor. We want to make building the armor cheaper than buying it from a terminal. 
And second, I want to use clusters for "improving" armor later. (IE, making armor with stat or skill boosts, like Nova Dillon, or Kirch Kevlar. . .)

Also, I chose not to add the top-of-the-line armors to this list for a reason.

I'm assuming that in the far future of AO there are still patents, meaning that the latest and greatest armor types (Nano, Biomech, Graft, Flower's Tech, Obtru, etc) are not something you can get away with making. (You can try, but the ICC goons will be a-knockin on the door shortly after, no?) 

Idea: The weakest/oldest armor types should be the ones with the most variations, with fewer as you pyramid up to the newer armor types.

C'mon, gimme some more ideas here! (Especially ones for building Tech armor).

Tatsu @ 7/21/2002 9:21:44 AM (39472):
Warlock, I believe the QL of the MRR determines the max ql armor you can make.  I created a QL 3 MRR for improving thrusting weapons just to test it out and people told me it was worthless.  I did try it on a ql 5 stun baton and no go.  

~Tatsu

Warlock @ 7/21/2002 10:42:22 AM (39472):
Thanks Tatsu,

I got loads of disks for crushing, thrusting and slashing but the only ones I've built I used an MRR os the same QL as the disk. Had a bad feeling that they wouldnt work on any higher stuff.

I really wish the QL system worked the same way for everything in the game (i.e. you need the same or similar QL parts for an items constructions), the fact the disks/PPPE only come in one QL potentially means a player could 'waste' a very rare armour PPPE by using it on a QL60 MRR and only being able to make 25% (ish) of the armour he could have it hed realised he could combine it with a QL200 MRR and make the damn lot.

Warlock @ 7/21/2002 10:46:02 AM (36521):
No, someone has posted screenshots of them in Dragon armour so the soft one is in the game too

However there is a rumor that the PPPE's were 'planned' to be in until 14.6 so if they have 'escaped' this may explain why they are so rare.

Warlock @ 7/21/2002 10:47:55 AM (38347):

I've built MRRs for Thrusting, Slashing and Crushing weapons. I can improve QL100+ weapons with a QL20 MRR, strangely enough.

Of course, the Slashing category holds the majority of weapons improvable by MRRs, so I bought a Ql120 of that one. No noticeable difference in the level of improvement. 

It's been a while since I improved weapons (don't use the MRRs much, not the profitable venture I had hoped they would be), so this may have changed in later patches.

Iv'e TRied making the bot per the steps in the book, But I cant combine the 3 Charges to make a Complete Explosive Charge.


the Blue thing in the Shope is aDetonartor Keypad. you combine three Liquid Exploisve charges then combine that with a detonator keypad, That is where i get stoped. Also i havent found a motion Drive yet in game. 

So the missing Pieces so far are : 

Inablity to make the Complete Exploisve Charge.

No motion Drive.

Beyond that you build a bot then use a holo cam on it to get a 3d Picture and use the Calulator on that which gives you the info need to make the Instruction Disc to make a Crystal which finally can be used to summon a Kamazi bot.

I think it's 85%.

Pretty easy to figure out, however. Get an implant of appreciatively high level, buy the lowest-level cluster you can find, and try combining it. The required QL of the part should pop up as an error-message, and it's simple to do the math from there.

Rustot @ 7/22/2002 10:58:49 AM (39185):
I have made character specially for crafting and I have chosen the engineer.

Main reason -  engineer can survive with zero combat, evades, speed, firstaid, etc. Only matcre and t&s are required for leveling.  I can to distribute most part of IP to tradeskills. 

Imho, there is such choice - trader must be good soldier (ie bad crafter) while not reach level 150+, then he can become good crafter. The engineer will be good crafter all time, but trader can be better at the end of game (better, if engineer w/o traders buffs). So if you want to  PLAY as good crafter,  choose engeneer. If you want to BECOME the best crafter at the end, choose trader. Note, trader will be the best crafter only in solo, ie if both only self-buffed.

xyberviri @ 7/22/2002 11:08:11 AM (39424):
well

you go up to the Good times Party mier guy and say

Hi
Living Cyber Armor
Boots     OR Gloves OR Body


and you get a mission. go to where the mission tells you to and thats it.

As far as what the "Hansen Personal Ore Extractor" is used for. you go into the BODY mission and you will find a Piece of Ql 50 Carbon rice rock, you use the item on it WHILE IT IS ON THE GROUND, IE dotn pick it up, and it goes Poof and you get the smelly piece of carbon. 

you take the Smelly piece of carbon to some guy out in wartorn valley that spawns near where Nuts and Bolts spawns. Hes omni tek btw which is why i had a hard time finding him.

you get the living body armor.

if you say boots you also need a pair of Cyber amor Boots Any ql in the mission you should find a "crashed implant" that buffs your Smg/MG, burst and -1% Exp you take that to Sarah Winters just East of hte mountine range north of the Greasy joints spawn


Then Finally for the gloves you get the mission and head out to the MMD forest and find some one  in the mission you get a  "Banded Ring of Hope" and take that back to the Sara winters chick that you find near the mountine range north of were Greasy joints spawns. 

as far as the rest of the suit qho knows.

Nullifax @ 7/22/2002 3:05:33 PM (38347):
I posted before on another thread about combining the charges.  Last patch the way you combine the charges is by stripping a flamethrower ammo, putting a tube in it, then stripping 2 more and combining the stripped flamethrower charges to the stripped one with the tube.  The problem is that it checks the QL in such a way that allows you a maximum QL of 2 because the flamethrower ammo only comes as QL 1.

There's no programming what basically boils down to a complicated gas tank to me  
			
		
	
Every wrote a program for a pacemaker before?  It's much more complicated than you describe.  Older models weren't that effective.  Newer ones are programmed so that the algorithms can be tweaked to match the person they are put into instead of having to re-code it for every person.  They even have small magnetic storage on them.  Unfortunately that means if you have a pacemaker and walk through a metal detector, your pacemaker's storage will be erased, meaning the program that runs it will be gone and the pacemaker will cease to function.

Do handmade weapons differ from other weapons?

Ewol @ 7/22/2002 4:00:06 PM (38347):
Pipslag is right, you can only make the "stripped" flamer ammo to QL1. When you add the tube to the stripped ammo it changes to the QL of the tube, if the tube is higher QL than 2 then you cannot add any further stripped ammo (you need to add to more to complete the charge).

The final explosive can be made but only to QL2, I have three QL1 ones at present.

There is only one thing missing and that is the motion drive.

Nullifax @ 7/22/2002 4:16:37 PM (38347):

Shining requires slightly higher than bright which requires slightly higher than faded.

I'm a bit fuzzy, but IIRC, a ql200 needs a 171+ shining, a 170+ bright and a 168+ faded.

I'm way too lazy to log on, get a blank implant, and buy ql5 clusters to read the message "a qlXXX implant requires the cluster to be at least qlYYY". You're welcome to try though.

Ewol @ 7/23/2002 2:01:43 AM (38347):
Ok, I'll do the full and accurate guide 

This is how you make the "flame" explosive needed for the Ql40 kami bot.

Use your screwdriver on a flammer ammo clip, this will give you a Container of Liquid Ammo. Add to this Container of Liquid Ammo an Active tube (available in Trade Center in stores, weapons parts terminal) this will give you a Liquid Explosive Charge of the same QL as the Active Tube. For this process to be completable you need the Active Tube to be QL1 or 2.  Now use your screwdriver on two more seperate flammer ammo clips to get two more Containers of Liquid Ammo. Add each of these in turn to the Liquid Explosive Charge then add the result to a Key Detonator. The result of that process is the final Complete Liquid Explosive.

To make the Complete Chemical Explosive for the QL140 bot all you need to do is add a Drum of Hydrochloric Acid to a Key Detonator.

All the parts you need for these can be bought from the terminals in the Trade Center are of shops, it's really quite simple

Flint2 @ 7/23/2002 9:54:30 AM (Uses for Camra, and ID Extractor?! 39969):
Hey hey!
Weird question here, but hey, curiousity killed the cat I guess:
What are the uses for the holo-camera, and ID Extractor?

Two uses known to me so far:
1. Use ID Extractor on the Holo-camera to create a ID Tag, what are the uses of ID-Tags, other then making a "Personal lock pick"?

2. Use the holo-cam to create the defunct Kami-Bot.

Oh yea, and what are the forms used for in the game?
I'm guessing that the "Sealing Cell Kit" is used to create a sort of sealed envalope for the forms.......but I tried it and it didn't work. =P

Any insight to this would be welcomed!  It's not exactly important....just nagging at me, ya know? ^_^'

are u saying that if I ever find a Soft/Hard Armor PPPE I can combine this with a QL1 MRR????

Pepin @ 7/23/2002 10:45:41 AM (37609):
Great site(s) (http://www.virral.com/ for the Chemical Mausser) guys & gals !! 

My 87 MA had lots of fun shoping for Mausser parts, Implant sets for Weapon Smithing, Elec. Engin. etc...

Too bad I didn't check that the assembling order of parts determined the QLs of the guns.... I have 3 or 4 QL 22 Chemical Maussers now, being the stubborn type that I am ....

It was a welcome relief from soloing missions, and gave me a new drive to level. Thanks again for the help from these 2 sites !!

Kzak @ 7/23/2002 11:17:04 AM (39916):
The only way to augment a finished weapon that I can think of right away would be to use a MRR (Improve crushing/slashing/piercing weapons) on one of the melee weapons that is in the MRR - Program List.

Kzak @ 7/23/2002 11:20:09 AM (39472):
Hmm... if I got hold of a PPPE for armor-creation, I wouldn't put it into a QL 1 MMR. What if Funcom decided to change the requirements for building armor in one later patch? I'd go for a QL180+ MRR, even if it costs literally millions to buy one, just to be on the safe side. Better safe than sorry. 

Especially considering the PPPEs are so ultra-rare and/or ultra-expensive.

Why, Funcom? Why?

Warlock @ 7/23/2002 11:56:03 AM (39472):
I'll do some testing with my weapons MRR's when I get some time as I built them with the same QL as the disk (got loads of disks so if the QL of the bot needs to be higher its not a major biggie (except for the cash) to make another one)

But unless the armour PPPE's become 'less rare' you really cant afford to risk it like Kzak said. Be interesting to know what QL MRR to people currently making armour used......

Having said that seems stupid that the disks/PPPE only come in a single QL if the QL of the bot _does_ matter (i.e its completely contradictory to the way everything else implants/mauser/sealed weapons(ish) work)

Cheba @ 7/23/2002 12:47:35 PM (39719):
If I put ql170 clusters into a ql200 basic limb, what quality would the finished implant be? Would it still be 200?

Thanks in advance.

coldwarkid @ 7/23/2002 1:20:53 PM (39916):
There's also the Mausser Chemical Streamer conversion, which is a considerable improvement on the Particle Streamer. Check, as ever, http://www.virral.com for precise details or buy the recipe from the terminal.

However, as far as I know these are the only ways to modify an existing weapon in-game. It's a pity, especially as the recipes to the only really desirable guns we can make (Michael Patriot and, to a lesser extent, MTI Aleph) are broken. I could really see a market for custom Kolt Magnum's, for example - Chemical Kolt's, anyone?

Cheers,

~R~

Maximilian @ 7/23/2002 1:21:31 PM (39719):
the result depends on several factors, which I only have soft knowledge about.

1) Determining is the implant and not the cluster!

but

2) You can (slightly) increase the ql of the implant with 'overclocking' (higher ql cluster than the implant). So if you start out with a ql90 implant and use a ql125 faded, a ql100 bright and a ql85 shining cluster you might end with a ql92/93 implant (never got 93 but a lot of 92s).

! Be careful while buying lower level clusters, put the lowest one in first !

3) The probability is influenced by your skill. If you have (a lot ?) more skill than necessary to put a cluster and implant together, the chance increases that you raise the ql while assembling. (Same mechanism works for monster parts)

Everybody with more solid knowledge is encouraged to correct or complete this info.

Hope this helps.

Good to know that it's possible to get one in a good range of mission ql (well i guess... ql 74 is far from ql 60 and if the mission was ql 74, the boss probably was ql 80+).

Only thing that puzzles me... it seems only clanners found one... I hope it does not only drop in clan territory.

Distortion @ 7/23/2002 4:15:38 PM (39649):
I meant the only non-shop part he is missing is the 190 robot part.

Parts needed in shop:
Personal Furance x4
Nano Circuitry Wire

Parts not in shop:
mantis egg
Gold x 3 ql190+
robot part ql190+
Soul Fragment x 3 ql190+

The finished egg is shown to be SPECIAL at the ql description, but it is really ql190.  This is why the key parts are ql190+.

Warfang @ 7/23/2002 4:44:07 PM (39719):
For QL200s the least quality of clusters you can put in:

Animosity @ 7/23/2002 4:49:30 PM (Makin a robot taunter 40022):
i was rather furstrated to find this tradeskill is busted.

I purchased the x-insectcide from the chemical bases store. Purchased the trimmer shell from the electronics store, and the impact injector from the melee parto store. The first time I tried to assemble them, I had the wrong quality of modified chem impact injector and it gave me a cute massage to that effect. Then I made a new chem impact injector of the right quality and tried again. There was no error produced, just one confused engie.

has anyone else seen this?
am I missing a step?

Pepin @ 7/23/2002 4:53:16 PM (37609):
Wow - *drool*...

Anyways, when do they start including 2H Blunt (*BEAMS !!!*) in the Database ?

Warlock @ 7/23/2002 5:01:00 PM (40022):
The lowest QL that will work (for the trimmer casing) is 30. Dont bother with anything lower than that because it wont work, and it wont tell you why either.

Anyone wanna buy an unused modified chemical impact injector lvl17 and a trimmer case lvl 17?

Sealing Kit is used in the Coffemaker process.

Cheba @ 7/23/2002 6:46:45 PM (39719):
Thanks for the advice guys.

So the simple rule of thumb would be to keep within 86% (or maybe even 85% as Kzak states) of the limb to keep the implant level at maximum.

And here's me always buying clusters that are higher than the limb (and yes getting a slight increase in level).

Oh yes, and is it true that ql196 implants become ql200, or are as good as ql200 implants? Someone was selling them on exchange and used the same price as they were the same?

I'm getting lots of ql200 limbs these days, so I'll start saving them and when I'm high enough I can equip them. 

Talking of which, is there anyone out there (probably a fixer) who wants ql200 limbs with junk (or maybe not) in who would take them off my hands to sell as basic limbs?

I'm not so much after the money, I'm more after a good chap who I can work up a level of trust/respect/friendship so that I don't have to bother with tipping so much. I prefer to work on favours then credits. If I *give* him something he can use, he'll do me a favour and put together a limb for me when I need it. Something like that, nice, simple and friendly. Know any high level bods that like that approach?

I'd play it safe too, find a 190+ MRR.

1. forget making crystals and weapons (the exception is if someone donates you all their tradeskill loot items

2. look at the medical stuff its worth it

3. try a robot brain, it will help your sence, and you might be able to sell it

Maybe you will rearrange the database so that one weapon with different ql was stored in one page? It will reduce the list in 10 times. For most weapons, enough to make simple script for standart prefix  removing. For example:

Ill-Treated Subturbine
Cast-Off Subturbine
Over-Tuned Subturbine
Second-Hand Subturbine
Subturbine
Quality Subturbine
Balanced Subturbine
Fine-Tuned Subturbine
Deluxe Subturbine
Premium Subturbine

Certainly, manual job is required too:

Cracked  Bolter 42mm
Rusty Bolter 42mm
Rick Bolter 42mm
Rick Bolter 45mm
Charged Bolter M9 42mm
Enhanced Bolter - The Hammer X9 42mm
Mass Lead Bolter 42mm
Bolter Cannon IX 42mm
Bolter Cannon XX 42mm
Turbo Mass Cannon 42mm

About re-arranging the weapons, I agree with you. That's someting I wanted to do when I started, but it didn't look that easy for the amount of time I had. I'll try to come back to it.

I found some of the manuals you said were missing:
(They are definitely in the item database, they might be missing from the shops)

QL161-199 Slank Chop: Composite Slank Chop

QL200 Mini axe: Premium Mini Axe

I think, developers can use easier way  They have the list of all links item1+item2=item3, therefore they can made automatic parser for all existed weapon manuals, search all components from manual in database by name and then check/rebuild links table.

Highorbit @ 7/24/2002 11:23:54 AM (40022):
They eventually make something!

I myself was curious why it wouldn't assemble (prior to learning that you can't)...

But...

What happened was this:

/me mumbles about crappy trade skills
begins try to make them combine using the Hammer Approach(TM)

You combine a QL17 Modified Chemical Impact Injector with Trimmer Casing to produce a QL199 Faded Computer Skill Right Hand Implant

This resulted in a lot of huh? What? taking a screenshot and then zoning a couple of times. But I still have that implant kicking around somewhere.

Sean-Roach @ 7/24/2002 1:27:01 PM (39315):
I like it, but then again I want FC to give us recipes to everything in the game.

From melting down that picture of Phillip Ross you see in missions to make ammo, (based on the event of the American Colonists melting down a statue of King George to make ammunition in the American Revolutionary War,)  to full, COMPLEX recipes for making the Yalmahas.  I also want FC to provide us with an easier way to acquire these recipes.  Let us take, alternately and on varying steps, a hacker tool and a screwdriver, to the items to break them down into their basic parts, (with the occassional part lost/destroyed/mangled beyond recognition).

Of course, another nice thing to have would be to give us upgrade/degrade capability ingame.  Need that cyber armor raised from QL 45 to QL 50 to match your new stats/level?  Run a cheapened form of the mass-relocating bot, (a disposable form, perhaps mass-relocating paste), on it.  Remove the sight assembly of that too-complex gun, and add a new compensator sight assembly, (easier to use, less accurate, resulting in less damage).

Oh, and I think omni-pol armor should be easier to hack than that.  Apply spraypaint PART to omni-pol armor to get clan armor.

Animosity @ 7/24/2002 2:07:57 PM (39315):
I totally love your suggestions.

I would love to be the gadget rich engie. My MP character is always being asked (and getting payment occasionally) for buffs. 

For me, it would increase my gameplay fun if I could post "lvl x engie working at xxxxx I can improve your weapons and armor. Tips not required but appreciated.

Darkbane @ 7/24/2002 2:16:28 PM (39315):
I'd like to see much more stuff makeable by players too. And better yet, upgradable by players. You should only be able to buy/find basic armour types. You'd then go to a trade specialist when you find the relevant part and get your armour upgraded.

Would be nice if there was ways to 'upgrade' the QL of armour and weapons too.

FC really missed out on trade skills and much more in the current design, they could have made life much more interesting.

Probably too late now, but...

Cosmik @ 7/24/2002 2:33:56 PM (39315):

Unit99 @ 7/24/2002 3:21:38 PM (39315):
You need to take that 2 second delay off the mission request. And your excuse to lower server load don't cut it. If your servers are being overloaded by people requesting more then 1 mission every 2 seconds you people are in SEVERE need of up to date server power. I'm >>paying<< for this game to have >>fun<< NOT incur one annoyance after another. Clicksaver cures your extremly poor mission requesting interface. You should not punish us further for your bad design by making it even more annoying to request missions for goods we are in need of.

Also something needs to be done with Broken Shores City of Home! This place is hidious!!! Topped with all the memory leaks your game causes and severe lag this playfield is all but unuseable to most. The only problem is high level missions there are made so desireable! I have a few suggestions. First make it so it IS NOT storming there almost ALL of the time as this does nothing but add to the memory leaks and lag. Second make missions there LESS desireable by making them MUCH larger and harder to obtain from common high level team forming areas like Newland City. Third do a little better job @ making outdoor hunting more attractive then you did in last patch. 

One other thing I would like to see addressed is the fact that MOST of the time it is so dark in your game that all your memory leak causing over done graphics are unseeable. I don't think making the game dark MOST of the time and telling people to adjust their game gamma is the proper way to go about things. This is poor design and thinking in the highest. Why should I have to change settings on my PC to be able to see a game I am PAYING for??

Well those are a couple big issues for me. Those at the moment are about the biggest problems with your game that are selling Star Wars Galaxies to me. Also the ninja looter problem, but that issue is being covered already. And let us not forget about your nerf happy attitude.

Hehe, Jim Salabim IS reading - and I do agree there's many good ideas here. There are also some excellent tradeskill ideas on the profession boards and other boards. 

If I had the time I WOULD make "everything" in the game possible to make with tradeskills

Ok I am a 50 Engineer, I have all trades maxed, I managed to acquire a PPPE(Shape Hard Armor) and yes I ma excited. I have decided  Iwill wait however long it takes to combine this PPPE with a minimum QL 195 MRR. Questions is this, is there a skill check for the combination of the PPPE with the MRR? If so what is the formula approximation for that skill check?

Thank you in advance.

I'm *so* there. That's what I really want, but it'd be such a gargantuan task I'm aiming for something a little more doable.



	
		
			
			
				
Oh, and I think omni-pol armor should be easier to hack than that.  Apply spraypaint PART to omni-pol armor to get clan armor. 
			
		
	
I always assumed the protection on the Omni armors was a little more . . .difficult than that. (In a world with nanotech it'd be *easy* to make armor that, oh, constricts sensitive bits if worn by someone without the proper ID signal. Or, maybe, heats the inside of the armor to 300+ degrees. . .or secretes hydrocloric acid or whatever. Insert evil ideas here.  )

You'd have to hack out all the id sensors (since they could be fully selfcontained units) and then repair the armor.


I do, however, think that there should be some good Clan only armors. Make em something other than Str/Sta, perhaps Psy/Sta or Int/Psy? (*hears all the Omni NT's scream*).

Perhaps something that looks like the knight armor. . .hmm.

I see no reason to force people to misson/shop run for the basic armors. Make the tradeskills work all the way up the chain and it's all good. (Don't worry, I have more armor modification ideas coming. *pats his handy text file*  )

This, I suspect, would be very hard to implement. Is there any possibility of getting this put in or should we not waste our time asking about it? (Hope FC is still watching this thread.  )

I wasn't suggesting that you shouldn't be able to make such armours too... but only the basic types should be in shops (missions are a whole different ball game...)

secondkenlon @ 7/25/2002 5:50:30 AM (39315):
Gotcha.

Yah, all the nifty armors should be tradeskill only, in my opinion.

This is, of course, predicated on the idea of the materials needed being readily availiable.

secondkenlon @ 7/25/2002 6:35:09 AM (40370):
The secret in finding the MOB that drops the PPE. 


Use a HSR Etch N Sketch to etch Curved carbonum Plating. (Both readily available in tradeskill terminals, I forget which ones exactly.

Then use a Mass Relocating Robot (Shape Hard Armor) on the resulting Etched Pattern for Carbonum *part*.

The problem is, to make the MRR you need a Programmed Photon Particle Emitter (Shape Hard Armor) . This is an unbelievably rare item. (Sells for 50 Million+ credits). I've heard, in fact, that it wasn't supposed to drop at all yet, so they may be upping the rate in the future. (*hopehopehope*)

Was a QL 62 mission, my wife (51 Enforcer) and myself on a team mission pulled it from the boss loot.

Darkbane @ 7/25/2002 7:19:44 PM (39315):
Yep, but the niftier the armour, the less common the item used to make it or upgrade to it. And special mobs could drop special items that add just a bit extra (and should look graphically unique - badge of honour, or badge of ubercamper at the very least  ).

Babadi @ 7/25/2002 9:10:39 PM (NT armor, where is it? 40529):
This armor has been confirmed to drop at least in low QL, the one i saw was 60ish i believe).  It supposedly came from a junkyard while the person was looking for nano tubes for the fixer quest.

My question is, is the higher end stuff in game?  Is it currently possible to obtain a full suit of QL 200 Notum Saturated Metaplast?

Just looking for an answer from FC.  A simple yes or no.

Mercatura @ 7/25/2002 10:19:36 PM (39472):
Combining "Shape Hard Armor" with a 200 MRR takes 500 in 3 or 4 skills.

Nanoprog, Elect Eng and something else I can't rem, maybe 2 other skills.

Just find a trustworthy higher level to do it for you. I know some decent people capable of that offhand, even though they're smelly clanners

This is one of those ideas that sound good, but will work out badly in practice. A better way to do it would be to have the niftier armors be *much* harder to craft (more steps, more skills needed, higher skills needed), forcing people to interact to build them.

Do you really want more camped items of boss-loot only items? I don't.

Thism however, would be cool. Want nifty spikes on your Primus Decus armor? Want red/green/blue/purplr circuitry patterns all over your Nano armor? Go forth and hunt some specific class or type of mob and get the item needed to add these uber looking addons. 

Or go and farm them to sell to others (social interaction good!). Don't make them actually add anything but "coolness factor" to the armor or we'll end up with cookie cutter syndrome again.

If you have a disc that needs to be made put that request in and one of our members will contact you to make the disc.
We may have the one you want in our inventory already.  We have reasonable prices.

shining max. 14%  lower than imp (imp ql100 , cluster min ql86)
bright 16%
faded 18%

Flyhard @ 7/26/2002 2:36:12 PM (How many lvl's over implant QL has a cluster to be to increase implant QL? 40664):
What I am thinking of: If I Have a QL 150 imp, but need a QL 180 imp f.ex., could I augment the implant with a QL 200 cluster, clear the imp again, do it again....and so on until I have my QL 180 imp? How far would this go? Can I increase up to QL 190?

Meligant @ 7/26/2002 2:40:35 PM (40664):
I'm 90% sure that it is more dependent on the skill used to insert then the QL of the clusters used.

I could be wrong  (possible)

Jynne @ 7/26/2002 3:08:33 PM (40664):
It's entirely skill dependent.

Clusters can actually be a certain % lower in QL than the implant they go in and still will raise the implant QL if the person who's making it has enough skill.  Faded clusters can be lower than bright, and bright lower than shining.  

At QL 200 basic implant, you can use:
QL 172 Shining clusters.  This is 14% lower than the implant QL.
QL 168 Bright clusters.  This is 16% lower than the implant QL.
QL 164 Faded clusters.  This is 18% lower than the implant QL.

I haven't tested the % numbers on lower QLs, but I encourage someone who's got enough nanoprogramming skill and some extra cash to try putting a QL 108 shining cluster in a QL 125 basic implant, a QL 105 bright cluster, and a QL 103 faded cluster.  According to my calculations, if the percentages are fixed for cluster vs implant QL, those should be the lowest QL clusters that will work in a 125 'plant.

ntrox1 @ 7/26/2002 3:25:44 PM (40664):
I think this is the case too.

Highorbit posted in another thread:

QL10 - 40: No increase 
QL40 - 90: Level increases by 1 - 3 levels 
QL100 - 130: Level increases by 1 - 6 levels 
QL140 - 180: Level increases by 1 - 5 levels 
QL190 - 200: Level increases by 1 - 4 levels 

Comes in handy HighOrbit!

My observations: with high NP skill (way over the requirement) you can put high QL clusters in low QL imps and force 1 level increase.  I think the difference is 20% above, so a QL70 imp with a QL84 cluster done by someone with 500NP will wield a QL71 imp.  Repeat for the other 2 clusters and you have a QL73 full imp.

I've never found anything that produced a platinum ingot when melted. These ingots appear to be extremely rare. If it was my engineer or trader who had found it instead of my enforcer, I would have made a ring out of it by now. Maybe this weekend I'll get someone to transfer it to my trader.

actualy I think you use the pppe on mrr and the mrr is reusable.. just make sure you make a good mrr so you can make all the armors you want

Onaris @ 7/27/2002 7:23:09 AM (40762):
OK I have never made one myself but this has been posted before.

The problem is that below ql 25(or 30 me not sure) you cannot make one and it doesn't tell you why.

But apparnetly trying the higher QL ones works fine.

hmmm maybe is was QL50.....

Onaris @ 7/27/2002 7:24:51 AM (40706):

The doc seems to be doing fairly well so far, and its great knowing ill always be able to find a team(half the battle of leveling) I also know that they should have decent tradeskills at higher levels. Ive just noticed most people say Engies are alot better at tradeskills than almost any other profession. I want to start a fun profession I can level and use good tradeskills with. Do any of you have any thoughts as having a doc with high tradeskills?

Ain't gonna happen. The only tradeskill that we get at a decent IP cost is Pharmatech.

Ever since I got my pioneer backpack, Ive used tutoring devices (adds 150 to tutoring)  And just recently I got an instruction disk for a robot that I couldnt find the crystal for... luckily a guildy made most of it for me, but then when He needed to use the netron displacer on the crystal, he realized he needed 710 in Quantum FT. 
    
     So, after asking around for a long while, and realizing that no one on rubi-ka has 710 in Quantum FT, I decided to get it myself, so I made an entire set of implants which adds 136 to the skill, plus I got expertise which adds 20, and I have a base of 453, so:

I end up with 136 + 453 + 20 = 609  and with ability buffs I can presumably add 1-4 points 

Ok, so I'm 100 pts short.. then I think ok well Ill just find a trader, and get a maestro.. no go, traders with maestros dont exist.. especially not ones with quantum FT maestros...

But I can get a journey so thats another 80 pts

Now Im only 20 pts short, so I finally think... WHAT ABOUT TUTORING DEVICES???

Then I realize that the SINGLE tradeskill that doesnt have a tutoring device is... You got it : Quantum FT

WHY why why why why?

Can anyone explain why Im so screwed?  Or maybe why QFT doesnt have a tutoring device.. please.. Im starting to think this is a conspiracy...  twenty measly points.. ugh

Acually someone posted a while ago that Doctors are the best tradeskillers. Why? Because they have the easiest time swapping implants. This makes sense to me since as an engineer I have to use several spots that would normally contain tradskill clusters for combat stuff instead.

Sparegris @ 7/28/2002 8:33:19 PM (Bulding weapons 41004):
If needed i can build some wepons or modify them for you. As im still in a newbie stage of buidling but i got alot of tradeskill points.
As far as ive gotten now ive been able to build up to QL 110 Chem mausser ( Modified that is ). Self buffed. Can find a trader and get masetro ofcourse and build / modify some more.
Im only able to work during the weekends as it is by now.

Contact either of the nicks that is listed under here and have all the items ready and i can build for you.
This is as only if you need anything built and im offering my services.

Regards Byggern ( The Builder )

am i best tradeskills at my level ,outside of pharma complit and tutoring no but if you need somethings made i can do it . specially for low levels around 1-50 come to me for those. if the trader you ask thinks you just want a wrangle or fixer ignores cuz you maybe the fifth gimme a... on the block.
I can help 
at level 60 i can also cast ic to get you into most things .
btw my break and entering is 200 so i can hack things also.

I dont put ip's into weps or fighting just healing and trade and flying so i can use my yalm.

Plasmatorch @ 7/29/2002 7:00:26 AM (MRR bot ql question 41095):
I recently purchesd 5 ql 200 MRR bots to combine with my PPE's for improving weapons much to my dismay though the improve crushing weapons PPE (QL 10) and the improve thrusting weapons (QL 20 ) could not be combined with a ql 200 MRR bot. Does anybody know off hand what is the highest ql MRR bot that can be combined with theese PPE's? thnx.

Kzak @ 7/29/2002 10:24:36 AM (41095):
What was the error-message you got when you tried to combine them? If you had prepared the disk properly to become a PPPE, you should have gotten a message that stated the minimum/maximum QL range.

coldwarkid @ 7/29/2002 10:57:19 AM (37609):
Disturbing news.

Ran into a newbie in the backyard last night, a LvL9 NT who was a newbie in the truest sense, that of not knowing thing one about the game. He was still armed with his solar-powered pistol and starting nanos, and had no armour or other equipment. He'd never been outside the backyard and of course the mission term had stopped giving him missions four levels ago.

Went shopping for a gun for this guy, and after having struck out on the first three tries decided to head up to the trade section and build him something. "The Electron Charged Pistol's not bad", I thought, "and I know that the recipe works because I've tested it myself".

Bought a kit. Started to assemble it. Didn't work.

I'd always thought that when Cosmik asked for the QL, it was in the sense of a general category such as Ill-Treated, Cast-Off etc. Apparently this is not the case, and the precise QL of the weapon makes a difference. Potentially, all the testing that we've done to date is invalid, at least in the format we've been recording it in.

So, Irreparable Electron-Charged Pistol, QL6, Broken at step 2.

I'd like to thank everyone in the tradeskill community who has contributed to this thread so far. However, I don't think it's possible for us to systematically check 200 QLs for each and every weapon in the database - we just haven't the time or the resources to do it. The sooner Funcom can automate the process, the better.

Eventually bought the newbie a PNG Tactical and a couple of nanos to get him on his feet, but it wasn't the same...

Troubled,

~R~

coldwarkid @ 7/29/2002 11:04:52 AM (39789):
Shouldn't do. The first weapon I ever made was a Flamethrower too, and that had the normal AR req.

However, you do sometimes get very odd side effects from the building process. I remember someone saying on another board that they once set out to build themselves a weapon and got a First Aid Kit from the finished process...

Congrats on the flamer,

Plasmatorch @ 7/29/2002 11:55:09 AM (41095):
Since the disks only come in three ql's . 10,20,30 the  lowest ql disk you can combine with a ql 200 MRR bot is ql 30.

so in other words it would not let me combine the ql 10 "improve crushing weapons" and the ql 20 "improve thrusting weapons" PPE's to the ql 200 MRR's

Can anyone clear up what this rather cryptic message means for me please?

Laptop @ 7/29/2002 6:53:22 PM (40834):
Comp Lit affects your prices in the vendor terminals. So one may speculate that by "tutoring" him in comp lit his prices are now cheaper. Although others dont actually get a stat increase from tutoring its currently self only.

Situation:
You have a QL 200 MRR and a QL 20 disc, it tells you that the disc needs to be QL 25+ (lol, it doesn't exist).

But fortunatelly (or unfortunatelly for you ) you only need your MRR 25% QL of the weapon's QL you are trying to improve. In other words, all you'll ever need is a QL 50 MRR to improve QL 200 stuff.

...or somethin like that!

While I'm sure it would not be cost effective, monetarily speaking, to do this... now that implants can be stripped, is it not possible to increase the QL of an implant as far as you'd like (up to 200) by adding clusters with a high NP skill, and then stripping them out?

Note, I'm not saying this is worthwhile, just that it seems possible.  Maybe it could be a party trick to impress your friends, or else a way to 'fine tune' an implant to a very specific QL.  Or turn those QL 194 implants you find missions into QL 200 ones by adding/stripping a few faded clusters?

Lisje @ 7/30/2002 1:36:30 AM (37609):
I just had an odd idea, and realize this theory is probably wrong, but on the off chance that it is not and no one else has thought of it I had to post it.  Given that:

1 - Most of the weapons listed as broken in certain QLs the problem seems to be in the lower qualites.

2 - By the time most characters have the cash, skills and inclination to do Tradeskills, they are higher level.

Theory:  It is possible these failures are because the kits requires parts to be in a specific RANGE of QLs, rather than merely "at least" as the message would indicate.  When trying to use a component of too high a QL (the sort that might cause the "implant creep" mentioned in another thread) the process simply stops dead.

Supporting this theory is the fact that at higher levels, the cash to buy something in a basic shop is far less of an issue than the time you would devote hunting in multiple shops, plus the odds favor that the part has been looted in a higher level mission.

Just a thought, but perhaps one worth exploring.  I don't even have a weaponsmithing character (yet) so I am probably wrong, but as I said at the beginning of this post, I felt it was worth mentioning even if only to be disproven.

But if you want to be independent is either a trader or doctor the best profession, a trader have tradeskillsbuff and doctors can easily swap high QL implants... Engineers is dependent on both of them...

3. Engineers

Warlock @ 7/30/2002 10:48:06 AM (40834):
Have I got this right?

Tutoring devices increase the specified skill, as long as you have enough tutoring to use them?

Presumably this is only any good if you have that specific skill maxed since I would rather invest the IP in the specific skill than in tutoring? (although I can see that with tutoring increased you would be able to increase any skill with the appropriate device, however this would only be good for occasional things since you wouldnt be able to keep that skill buffed?)

Warlock @ 7/30/2002 10:49:38 AM (41287):

Now you're giving me nightmares. If the kits are broken at different levels on different dimensions, there's no way we can map this. Cosmik, tell us it ain't so!

The "range of QL's" idea is a possibility, although it's not been a problem for me before. In this particular case, haste made me buy a QL44 part, which was the last component the kit accepted. If this is the case, we need to hear about it ASAP.

Comes in handy HighOrbit!

My observations: with high NP skill (way over the requirement) you can put high QL clusters in low QL imps and force 1 level increase.  I think the difference is 20% above, so a QL70 imp with a QL84 cluster done by someone with 500NP will wield a QL71 imp.  Repeat for the other 2 clusters and you have a QL73 full imp.

One more thing.

Because the cluster levels have varying NP requirements (ie. Faded has a considerably lower requirement than shining) the faded cluster will always cause the highest increase.

As an example of this, while wanting to make a Ql180 implant from a QL78 implant we did the following:

Installed Shining cluster (No QL increase)
Installed Bright cluster (2 QL increase)
Removed 1k Token board (reducing NP by 210)
Installed Faded cluster (1 QL increase)

Normally in that situation I would have expected an increase of 3 - 4 levels for the faded cluster.

This is not a particularly common solution to a problem such as this, and I have no intention of removing the 1k board for every faded cluster I install - this was merely a special case.

Level 27 is the lowest quality for +5, and you can use q17 "bought parts" for it. IMHO its the most profitable brain, should cost about [er dont remember] to make, easily sells for 10x the price anyway.

[edit: about it not being profitable, I made my first million at level 40 selling these for 1 day  ]

Brontos have feelings too. Its wasteful to kill an animal only for its hyde. If they go exstinct due to overhunting, so does your chance at getting your precious hyde.

I know it works for the improve weapon MRRs, because the QL 10 disc can only be combined with a MRR QL 66 or below anyway. I guess it's 25% of the QL, but could be even lower! (even better )

As far as Armor MRRs go, I'd guess it's the same story. I kinda suspect they made the armor PPPEs QL 60 because of the problems with weapon MRRs i described above, since QL 60 discs can easily be combined with a QL 200 MRR. It's not like ppl who have these PPPEs have cash problems and looking to buy the lowest possible QL MRR which works on QL 200 stuff

Actually, she meant 4 million times, unless you're omni and it's slilghy less.  The good news is that leets in the backyard tend to carry an average of 10 credits (if you include gems and whatnot being dropped).

So, you only have to kill about 400,000 backyard leets to get your yalm!

Go get em, soldier!

I didnt go gimp until ip reset 

Having to drain for maestros takes time too so until you can selfcast might as well be an engy 

Still my tradeskills tab would make a lot of engys drool  I do leave chemistry over 750 to the real guys who implant swap all day 

I bet Im the only person to make a virral egg while inside arena too 

Enough about me
Id first take 1 or 2 skills and max them since its easier to get use out of them. 2 easy single skills that actually work are NP and Mech, and you would get a lot more work than 5 half maxed skills unless you like making QL10 nanos 

I think those 2 are used to activate the aggro and agg-def robot trimmers also

Lisje @ 7/31/2002 5:45:19 AM (41435):
Its definitely the part.  I tried a L26 part with a L21 or 22 (sorry, I forget exactly)  unfinished and got "The QL is too low" message.  However, now I wonder if (and how much) a high weaponsmithing skill will allow you to increase the QL of the unfinished weapon.  I tried a L26 part with a L21 or 22 Tellus (sorry, I forget exactly)  unfinished and got "The QL is too low" message.  A L24 part worked, but I really would have liked to go higher.

BTW - I now have a low-level soldier on R2 now looking for Tellus unfinisheds up to around QL50, should anyone chance upon one....

it's the part that decide the final QL of the gun. The first time I got my recipe (after the patch that introduced team mission), I tried every single part in the basic shop for a QL150 recipe, hehe, guess what, I ended up with a QL3 gun

Xeni @ 7/31/2002 2:05:47 PM (36439):
As i wrote this post some weeks ago, as this board was new and the activity was very low, i bump it up again same time as i come with some new views and comments.

I would encourage all tradeskill users and others to post their views and suggestions here, so we can make tradeskills even more fun.

stacking of tradeskill items: Im not sure how realistic this is. If it was to implemented i think ppl would harvest and bank tradeskill items in larger numbers than we all wanted. Either the stacks should be very limited, else i think my above suggestions would help us out alot. A idea would also be bags only for tradeskill items, that can contain a larger number of parts. After all ten nano pylons take alot less space than 10 stigma rifles.

Different QL tradeskill items have same icon: To easier could sort out same type tradeskill items of different QL, i suggest to implement a background color connected to the QL of the item. Like a QL1 nano pylon would have green background, QL100 would have bluish, while QL200 would have reddish.

80% of the items in the game now is looked upon as 'junk': 
If you do a mission, loot all chests, mobs and boss, im sure most players would sell at least 80% or more of the items to the bank, as they have no value for them or others. The % is probably higher. Also the introduction of new items makes other obsolete(yes, learnt this word in civ). An example of this is the agent rifles stigma and disafilation sniper, who noone wants or use anymore now for obvius reasons.

What i would have liked is if instead of introducing new items to assemble new items, these new items is made from 'junk'items or obsolute items.
For the one part, if there is alot of items that suddenly become obsolete, people would naturally look into ways to make them usable again. If they cant use the whole item, they dissamble it and use what they can. I know rubi-ka is a wealthy planet of resources, but i think Rk also have it limits to how far it can go with 'buy it today, scrap it tomorrow' idea.
2nd. yes i support a large numbers and variations to do tradeskills, but bring in alot more items than necesary, is no good.
3rd nothing is like the feeling when you find out that your rusty junk really is shining treasure  

think that was it for today, now i hope the servers come up soon so i can build ithaca vulture custom super A....

Kzak @ 7/31/2002 10:30:31 PM (Weaponsmithing suggestion 41688):
Here's one idea that I thought about for a bit. Give me some feedback on this one, please?

--

To build a weapon via a construction kit, you usually need a number of parts, and over ten isn't uncommon. You also have to do a fair bit of shift-right-clicking.

What if.. the construction kit itself functioned like a 'bag' in the sense that it opened up a new area in the inventory like a normal bag, but with numbered slots where you could place the parts required to build the weapon, corresponding with the numbers of parts the building manual for the weapon suggests?

Every part would have to be checked upon being placed into the numbered slot, for being the correct type of part and having the minimum QL or above for the construction kit.

Upon placing the last part into the correct slot, the weapon construction kit would complete itself and turn into the correct weapon, considering the array of parts and QL.

Lisje @ 7/31/2002 11:36:49 PM (41688):
Sounds like a good suggestion that would immediately be discarded because of the amount of new coding required to put a totally new system in place.  But given the fact that weaponsmithing as it stands seems hopelessly broken, perhaps it would be simpler to just scrap the existing system totally, rebuild it from scratch and stop trying to patch the holes.  After all, in every other aspect of life (cars, appliances, electronics...) there comes a point where it makes more sense to replace than to repair.

Long ago in patch notes i saw refrence to a Arul saba bracelet or ring. have not seen any of thes items , nor am i shure what they do. I found a gem that is Called a searing arbiter gem, it says crafted by Arul saba on it and it says the gem has nano circutry inside it and appears to have a small socket on it.....

I tried all kinds of things to put it into etc but to no avail so eventually gave up and noone else i talked to ever remembered that patch note i was talking about....

I was asking around if anyone knew what the gold and platinum ingots that i got from cyborgs were used for and someone told me to make jewlry and rings etc...is it possible that you inset this gem into a crafted ring  or bracelt?

Id like to try but dont have the tradeskills to do so

Any ideas?

Lisje @ 8/1/2002 4:52:54 AM (41723):
Simplest answer is they don't seem to have ever made it into the game.  Bits and pieces of them have however.  I was all excited myself January/February with the prospect of a tradeskill that seemed tailor-made for my adventurer.

Here's a link to what's known about them.
http://www.virral.com/guide-arulsaba.html

My current guess?  Mr. Saba resides in Jobe...  (just call me a cynic on this one)

Intrepid @ 8/1/2002 6:24:06 AM (41723):
Huh?? tailor made for a adventurer??

I am 99.9% sure Arul Saba was a engie.

Intrepid @ 8/1/2002 6:32:30 AM (38720):
Well lets see.  At ql200 those ingots require 1000 mech eng for one of the steps to make into rings.  Don't remember which one so don't ask:P

Anyways for a solitus the max you can have for mech eng with ql200 imps for ME agil and int at level 200 is 946

Then you can add 12 for the bowtie
12 for the handy gloves
20 for the experitse
20 from the khan
125 for maestro.

So at level 200 it is possible to get up to 1135 mech eng.  Assuming it follows the same trend that means you can do rings with ingots up to ql227

Quite a bit of the ingots and items are found well above that level and are totally useless.

Keep in mind to do anything over ql200 your going to have to be very tweaked and above level 165 for sure.

Since this item will require the blueprints (according to the text) and the blueprints can only be got from Arul Saba himeself (by doing him a favour it would seem) until the NPC Arul Saba appears in the game I wouldnt expect to be able to makes these.

Think of this in the same way Engineers think of the Kamikazi bot

I had both comp lit and pharmacy up to about 400, and it was ip cheaper for me to raise tutoring for the first time and get the benefits of a device, than to raise both those skills.  What I mean is that 10 points from 2 skills above 400 probably equals a couple of hundred points in tutoring if it hasn't been raised.

Both comp lit and pharmacy are skills I only need once in a blue moon, so it doesn't matter that they're not permanently buffed.

Tutoring is definitely worth it, I just wish I could make a heap of cash selling it to people

Krabbus @ 8/1/2002 10:30:52 AM (40834):
It's pretty stupid that u can't tutor more than one skill at the time... so the tutoring devices is pretty useless when you are making nanocrystals since several steps need 2 skills, and you can only tutor one...

Why can't tutoring lock the skill that is tutored instead of tutoring?

is it possible to make QL40 and QL140 explosions now?

coldwarkid @ 8/1/2002 11:18:15 AM (41688):
Fair comment, I think.

The existing building system does work perfectly well for certain types of item. No-one I know has reported any problems with making nano-crystals, or robot trimmers. However, weapons are a different story, with entire categories of weapon broken. Worse, some QL's appear to be bugged even for recipes that are otherwise working, and now we have reports that one particular gun both works and doesn't work at QL6. Obviously, what's going on behind the scenes is rather more complex than we might have imagined, and represents a mammoth task to overhaul.

Trimmers work because they're a simple recipe, and a unitary QL band from 1 to 200. XU-11 Serum into Chemical Impact Injector into Trimmer Casing yeilds an Aggression Trimmer. With weapons, an Ill-Treated Kolt 58 is a different item in the database to a Cast-Off Kolt 58. Anarchy apparently decides whether the finished product will be Ill-Treated, Cast-Off or Premium by checking the recipe that was used, instead of by looking at the QL of the kit and as a result most weapons have no fewer than ten different recipes to make the entire QL range.

Perhaps the simple solution would be to for the game to name the finished weapon dependent on the QL of the building kit, and to have a single recipe per weapon that worked all the way through the QL range.

However, while we're at it, why not take the opportunity to overhaul the rest of the process as well?

I think that using the building kit as a receptacle is a good idea in principle, but puts us in the situation of having to make one single skill check against perhaps three or four different skills to put the weapon together. That means that you can't collaborate with someone else if, for instance, your Chemistry skill is lacking. One person has to have the skills to assemble the entire weapon in one go.

One way around this would be to keep the current method of step-by-step assembly, and simply add a display window feature to the kit so that instead of shift-left-clicking on the kit for a description, I right-click on it to bring up its build window which shows me the parts that have already been installed. Added functionality might be the facility to strip parts out again, starting from the latest and working backwards.

A couple of other possibilities: prime the kit using the construction manual, so that it knows what sort of weapon it's supposed to be. This would have the added benefit that parts yet to be added could be displayed in the kit's build window, so that you don't have to constantly refer to the manual during the build.

The logical corrollary of this is the weapon deconstruction kit. Funcom toyed with the idea of reverse-engineering weapons some time ago, but never implemented it. Fair enough, considering the problems with the existing system. However, if each type of weapon has only a single recipe, why not add a reverse-engineering kit that can be used on a weapon to determine how to construct it, assuming the user has a high enough weaponsmithing skill. Have it spit out a manual if successful, which can then be used to prime weapon construction kits etc...

Comments?

1. The system is fine, but could be made simpler (and bug-free) with Soyuz's idea : 1 recipe per gun, QL of Construction Kit determines QL of finished gun. No new code needed, just a few lines deleted. (Armchair coach here  )


2. Building kit = receptacle ? New coding... given the record of "bugs per new code" around here, I wouldn't ask for this out loud again twice...


3. Building Kit displays the parts it needs, as opposed to only the parts assembled as of today : I like that idea !!!  But I have a printout of every recipe fo any gun deemed of interest....
I'd rather FC work on : more than 2 "open bags" at one time, and more than 1 ID window open at one time. Or be able to "block" 1 "open bag", and make the other one cycle. Or show which item/bag in one's inventory possesses a shortcut.


4. Reverse-engineering is very nice & all, but too powerful IMO : in a matter of a few days, everyone and their mother would be running around with the "weapon of the week/month"... Gamma Ejector, Kerrans, Claws, whatever the uber weapon for the profession's level would be...


5. Has anyone tried to assemble parts in an order that was *not*  described in shop-bought Weapon Recipes ? i.e. : come up with a SFA 3297 by accident ? or a Gamma Ejector ?

I should have added a caveat to the effect that not all weapons would necessarily have a recipe in the first place. Of course, all it'll do if your Weaponsmithing is too low is give you an "inconclusive results" message. If it's high enough you either get a manual or a "This weapon cannot be reverse engineered" message.

No-one has managed to make anything really useful this way, although someone on the Engineer forum (I think) claimed to have followed a recipe correctly and recieved a First-Aid Kit for his troubles...

Lisje @ 8/1/2002 1:11:09 PM (41723):
Guess I need to clarify my "adventurer" comment.  

1 - The only tradeskill adventurers get cheaply is MechEng.

2 - As the game stands now, the only item made with MechEng exclusively are rings, a nice way to get some extra money, but hardly what you'd expect "the hardy outdoorsman" to be doing in his/her spare time.

3 - From the description, this appears to use MechEng exclusivly, for a yield that is neither money nor ornamentation, but actually useful and potentially sought-after.

4 - It's a QUEST to find the person to obtain the blueprints, that does fit my image of an adventurer.

Addendum - (Purely personal woes here) I love tradeskills, but find I have no empathy with playing the classes that dominate the tradeskill market in this game.  I figured I would take my lumps and spend some IP there anyway, and it would be OK.  This was PRE-IP reset, which I missed since I was offline during the time that was active (still POed on that one) and PRE-SOLs which would have given me some breathing room.  I simply can't afford the IP investment to do tradeskills with the character I enjoy playing, so I have an army of low-levels while I search for one where I can afford the IP and enjoy playing.  So my adven is stalled at L60 while I hunt (and stew just a bit, in case that wasn't obvious)  This was going to be Lisje's redemption, instead it turned out to be merely a false hope.

You can buy the Vision Enhancer in shops.  Tools vending machines (or was it Devices?  The one with the Movement Predictors and NCUs in it.).  You see it where the Movement Predictor usually sits when VE spawn in that shop.  VE's are not in shop all the time though.

This has nothing to do with my original topic:

Warlock's sig discribes dealing with Funcom.  My version of this is;  Dealing with Funcom is like trying to teach a Pig how to dance - It frustrates you and annoys the pig.

It's also that way when talking to ARKs.  90% of the ARK/GM populace are ZERO help.

Me:"Hi.  I'm having a problem here.  The mobs are shooting guns, then nuking, but there's no animation for the nuking - you never see it coming and they can still fire weapons normally.  We, the players, have to cease fire to nuke or cast.  In this respect, the mob is overpowered and the player has little to no time to heal.  And note that I have a good heal pet and a Doc in the group.

ARK:"Hmm.  Well, must be lag."

Me:"Then server lag is very bad."

ARK:"Not server side, client side.  You are lagging so you don't see the nano animation."

Me:"Um, no.  You can ask everyone in the team - we all have this problem.  And I've broadcasted over public and everyone is in consensus that there is no animation, therefore the mobs are either broke or too juiced.  This is not a lag issue."

ARK:"That's lag.  It can affect everyone in the area."

Me:"Server wide?  If it's server wide then it's 'server' side lag."

ARK:"Not really.  Anything else I can help you with?"

Me:"You want to help with this first?"

ARK:"I just did.  Now unless you need anyhting else, I must be off."

Me:"Leave.  Before I PK you for the idiot you are."



This is no bull****...  That's paraphrased for brevity of a pet response I got by an ARK on RK2.  I even asked this guy if he was new and he said he's one of the more experienced ARK's.  I have complained about this, but who listens...

Anyway, hopefully we can get these bots...

Stercoral @ 8/1/2002 4:29:57 PM (38347):
I feel like defending ARKS today.

IMO you shouldn't have contacted an ARK for your problem, they are here to help with immediate problems (stuck somewhere for example). In place there are others ways: email to FC (bug report), official boards. Note that it's has nothing to do with effectiveness.
Everytime I've contacted one, he helped me enough and was very kind (I had a problem with surgery clinic, being stuck somewhere in rocks, lost the key of my mission, and maybe other things that I don't reply right now).

And I have animation when NPC cast a nuke or simply a NF, I'm just amazed too see how much they resist to my nukes-calms-root while it seems I almost never resist theirs.

Kzak @ 8/1/2002 4:43:19 PM (41688):
OKay, good suggestions here, priming the building kit with the manual is a nice idea.

A modification to the receptacle to allow it to be constructed by other people than yourself:

Make the skill-check for the added part only when it is added to the receptacle, forsaking the combined skill-check when all parts are complete. This way, the receptacle can be passed to other people who can add the necessary parts if the character's own skills are insufficient. The receptacle still transforms into the completed weapon upon adding the final part.

I would also like that you don't have to necessarily put the parts into the receptacle in the right order, as long as they are put into the slots.

Eventually, the slots could be disposed of entirely, just as long as the right parts were successfully added.

Actually not much. Before I found out there was gonna be a reset, I played it safe. Only mined in well know places and managed to break it even (with a small lose, but my skill was low).

After I heard about the reset, I mined in more remote places and tried placing bombs every where and therefor had big red numbers on my mining account.

Now I just look forward to the big patch next week...PE is a game I follow closely, cause if Mindark gets it right, it's gonna be hufe. If they don't, it will crash and burn like the rest.

Hopefully I'll someday be able to post the skill reqs and more details about the processes. Unhappy Trader, your post about what parts makes what is very valuable, If anybody knows any other details please post them. What I'm most interested in is the reqs to make ql 200 pieces of armor and if all the armor has the same reqs. In addition I'm curious if the ql of the MRR is important. 

I think all my questions would be answered if I could get my hands on several pieces of ql 200 hides. Perhaps I'll give Chestity a tell. If anybody else would be able/willing to contribute give Ionicdude a tell.

Mendas @ 8/2/2002 12:03:02 AM (37532):
Mining, or some other form of gaining raw materials for income, is IMHO a good idea. It's used on text RPG Core 2651. You're basic job is to mine ore. You're mining level dicates where you can mine. Where you mine dictates what ore you get/money you make. You get paid based on how long you mined and the value of the ore you turn in. To prevent people from mining all the time to boos their income, there are several shifts that you can join, each encompassing around two to three hours a piece. The ore that you mine goes into the planetary warehouses, where it is refined and shipped to player run stores that make items from that ore. Armor, weapons, etc. Thus creating a stable economy. You mine ore which pays you money that you spend on items created from the ore you mined . . . . . . you get the point. AO needs an innate economy like that. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Krabbus @ 8/2/2002 7:58:11 AM (41969):
Yes, it's possible, but you need a Programmed Photon Particle Emitter (Shape Hard Armor) that drops in 1/1000 as boss loot... so it's pretty hard to get. You can always buy one of other players, if you have 100M credits in you pocket.

The easiest piece to make is just to buy some Sheet of Curved Carbonum Plating  in the tradesection of any shop at combine it with one of the HSR - Sketch and Etch to make a template - after that you have to combine it with MRR - Shape Hard Armor (wich you got after combining the PPPE with the MRR)

An example of Carbonum armor:

Squick @ 8/2/2002 2:20:09 PM (41723):
If I had to make a guess I would say they are not going to be put in the game until bracers get 'the big nerf.'

Which knowing Funcom will more then likely just be making them stop dropping, causing everyone that already has their title 6 bracers of every type to become another step "more uber" then everyone else.

And wouldn't they need to really boost those damages?

Was it ever verified if that is pre-calculation damage, or post-calcuation damage?  IE... is that +46 damage the same as turning a 1-200 weapon into a 47-246 weapon?  Because that would be pretty good...  But if it is post calculation damage, adding 46 onto a hit of 1000 does not help much...

     QL 120 Photon Particle Emitter
     QL 120 Crystal Reflect Pattern Medical

The required Skill will be well into the 600's in MechEng / ElecEng / Quant FT / NP / Complit

It may even be higher  I am not sure as it requires a skill over 200 to make a QL 40 Nano Crystal

I wish you luck in finding someone and If Anyone can help hiim Please also Post your name here as you are sure to make ALOT of new friends =)

p.s. I do believe that the rock you have will work but if you can find a QL 239 then That would be your best bet.

Distortion @ 8/2/2002 5:16:03 PM (42015):
The ql is too high, u need a 200 engineer to even try.  I even doubt a 200 trader can do it.

It's alot easier to get that nano in a mission than to make one.

Would be nice to know which IQ rings and/or reflect bracers give platinum ingots. And what about rings of power? If anyone finds out, please reply to this post.

I was having trouble selling a +8 energy damage ring and decided to just throw it into my rings/gems/bracers, etc. backpack. I did an IPR on my ME and Pharma Tech at around level 43. I'm level 47 now and can't wait to get to level 50. When IP is more plentiful, I'll raise them again.

Berkut @ 8/2/2002 8:08:18 PM (Are tradeskills really that broken??? 42095):
Judging from what I ahve seen in guides and such, it seems like tradeskills are rather broken in many case. Many weapons cannot be built, armor cannot be made, etc., etc.

Coming from DAoC, I really liked tradeskills as a nice diversion. It certainly adh its problems, but player made items were a major part of the economy. That doesn't seem to be the case in AO, but that might be my own ignorance.

So, I wanted to make a trader or engie in order to do some tradeskills. There doesn't seem to be any decnet guides around, and what I ahve seen has been rather sidcouraging, to say the least.

If the tradeskills are just plain broken (recipes not working, etc.) why haven't they been fixed? My is the developers working on an expansion when the base game is still broken?

Berkut

Dharien @ 8/2/2002 9:38:51 PM (42095):
Yes they are that broken.

Weaponsmithing.. Chemical Maussers and finishing a couple of the recepticles.

Nanoprogramming.. probably the only one that is really worthwhile

Engineers need one or two of them to use trimmers and whatnot, but they don't work all that well anyway.

Just about everything is needed in very (too) high numbers to make nano crystals

Armor? heh, new.

Pharmatech is useful, somewhat. Few good things here but very expensive.

Aside from the virral egg, that's about it.

Wish we could mod weapons and armors.. would be really worthwhile then.

Yes, this is an awesome Idea, I will definitely join anything set up like this, Im a 103 engineer currently, and have maxed all tradeskills including tutoring, with the exception of psychology (dark blue and useless) and pharma tek(because I really dont run across monster parts all that often)  I have absolutely no attack power beyond that of my bot, so this idea sounds great to me... maybe we should set up a time to meet?

I know this is a minor point but even tutoring one skill helps make a nano crystal as the clusters conflict. On the rock side you could make up multiple sets of implants for each stage to avoid the majority of conflicts, but on the disc -> PPPE side the comp lit and nano prog conflict, while tutoring clusters do not. So you can tutor one skill and implant the other.

Found out that too, this way it's working out really great... in my implants set will tutoring replace the faded spot 

It's pretty nice that I can make QL160ish nanocrystals at level 124  and that's just by using QL140ish tutoring devices and QL125 implants, yeah I'm engineer... I could made QL190 if I had the meastroes...

Ewol @ 8/3/2002 8:58:16 PM (41969):
Bunny, there is one more type of armour known as Notum Saturated Metaplast. The Notum Saturated Metaplast shell is found in missions (chest loot I think) and the final armour can only be used by NanoTechnitians, from what I've heard it's pretty good.

coldwarkid @ 8/3/2002 9:14:00 PM (42222):
There's a good listing at http://www.virral.com but all of the areas where carbonrich rock occurs are either 25% zones or have nasty, nasty red mobs prowling around. Or both.

That said, if you save beforehand it's not too much of a problem, just irritating. I've not been attacked by another player so far, but on every foray but one I've been killed by a prowling mob. As you go up in level though that should become much less of a problem.

Cheers,

The idea shouldn't be to have a mob drop the special part needed. The idea should be to be able to pull the component out of some raw material and make that rare based on skill needed/random chance.

For example, robot junk is fairly common but the only thing that can be pulled from it are nano sensor. Have the nano sensor be the 'base' component that can be removed from robot junk with the bare requisite skill. So if you need and have 100 mech engineering, you get a nanosensor. Then for the skill above that base your chance increases to pull a rare object out of the junk instead. If it's desired that an item is supposed to be rare, make the chance of pulling that from the raw materials as rare with high skill. So a level 200 Trader with max mech eng skill/implants and Maestro: Mech Eng running would only have a 5% chance of getting that object out of QL 200 robot junk. For ql 100 robot junk, he'd have a 15% chance of getting the part.

Onaris @ 8/3/2002 11:38:51 PM (42186):
hmmm not sure about eh HQ emergency labs or whatever they called but you can make a first aid kit like the startup ones (but at any QL you got a mob part for) and these add both hp and NP. I think this is much better as you can easily click your nano chargers and health kit as they lock differecnt skills. With first aid you have to choose between HP and NP and for an NT that is usually a tough choice to make, if only the kits were a reasonalby sensible price to make!!

phil @ 8/4/2002 6:19:16 AM (42222):
The other day, I went to Central Artery valley to pick up the carbonrich rock I needed to make a crystal, and discovered that unless you are level 200 and have a whole bunch of uber badasses with you, you cannot mine alone without a yalm... The top version of snakes, anuns, and lifebleeders (called mind destroyers or something liek that) are swarming around the place where you pickup the rocks.  The only way to do it is to fly straight down, grab the rock, and fly straight back up again.  And even then about 2000 things aggro you...

a nice payoff however..

Tarage @ 8/4/2002 7:33:13 AM (42015):
Well, I originally wrote this message on how impossible it is to make this nano. I happen to have the disc, and a QL240 rock, so I thought I would try to get some numbers to show just how imposible it is. While doing this I actually completely made the nano. So I guess it is possible. :] Numbers below.


QL239 Instruction Disc (Anima of the Abomination)

Result: Programed Photon Partical Emiter (Anima of the Abomination)

QL240 Carbonrich Rock
Combine QL60+ Jensen Personal Ore Extractor
Req: 720 ME
Result: QL240 Carbonrich Ore (the QL will be higher than 240 with higher ME skill, I used unbuffed ME skill so that the QL of the rock would not increase)

QL240 Carbonrich Ore
Combine QL120+ Isotope Extractor
Req: 900 ME and EE
Result: QL240 Pure Carbon Crystal

QL240 Pure Carbon Crystal
Combine QL120+ Neutron Displacer

QL239 Programed Photon Partical Emiter (Anima of the Abomination)
Combine QL240 Prepared Program Crystal - Medical
Req: 1123 NP and 1075 ME
Result: Nano Crystal (Anima of the Amobination)

Thanks to Dovve for +92 NP. It brought me up to 1082 ME and 1143 NP for the last step.


Still, it is pretty easy to just blitz for the nano since you can get it as mission rewards. I was able to get six in one day when I was level 133 just blitzing QL239ish missions. I was just able to make this probably on my last level or two (195-196). That is a big difference from when you're able to mission for the nano, and when you're able to make it.

At the moment none.

You can melt them down which is sort of moding them.... but I don't think that is what you meant. If you make a ring you can add a gem to it but the only point of this is to make money when selling them.

There is supposed to be an aruba salba (or something) bracer that can be made but I do not know if this is in yet or not.

But then to make tradeskills have title caps?!?!?!? Sheesh. It is hard enough to play a character focused on tradeskills as is (like nano programming for example). But now you not only have to suffer through tedious killing just to do tradeskills, but when you hit your title cap, you have to level and NOT EVEN ADVANCE THE TRADE SKILLS WHICH ARE THE WHOLE REASON YOU ARE LEVELLING IN THE FIRST PLACE!

I still had some other trade skill stuff I didn't need to use (though I used them the first time which is why my final numbers are different from my original post), and there are some Engineer only stuff that would have made the last two steps a little easier.

Bionitrous @ 8/5/2002 4:26:29 PM (42015):
Platy,

It's soooo much easier to simply have someone blitz you a 231 mission for the completed crystal.  You probably can't pull a mission that high, but any half decent blitzer at around lvl120 should be able to.

I blitzed my own Anima of the Abomination and got it on the first try.  Didn't even need an Essence or runbuff.

Sooooooo much easier than trying to get it made.  Even if it were able to be made via tradeskills, the top level tradeskillers would still charge ya (fairly, I note) 2-5 mill to make it.

klax @ 8/5/2002 4:58:49 PM (41435):
Think it was about 10% of the part that makes what ql the wpn is to be or something. Not to sure since i dont see them alot these days.

Provisioner @ 8/5/2002 5:08:25 PM (42477):
Technically, they didn't lie about being able to level from tradeskills alone.  You can, and I've done it.  

However, it is insanely boring and not what I had expected from Anarchy Online.

As most trade skill items are useless, and the demand for the "good stuff" exists in the materials, NOT the finished product, really, it's all muddled.

For example, you can walk into a shop and buy carbonum plating, but need to have a CL 60 alt run a few hundred team missions just to get the PPPE to make anything of it.  Of course, you could always buy it, but that's just silly (I saw one going for 100 million the other day - for a QL 60 item!).

Anyway, yes, you can level off tradeskills (not suggested).  Max your "Mechanical Engineer", "Electrical Engineering", "Nano Programming", "Field Quantum Pysics", and "Computer Literacy" (not all required for the basic steps, but all needed to be a good Nano Program Builder).  Implant the hell out of these skills, and get the basic items that buff them.  Buy your tools.

Now, go out to a 25% zone (!) that contains carbon-rich rocks, and have fun clicks a million times.

At level 150, it takes roughly 13 million to level.  Doing missions, that's about 370 kills (assuming 35k a kill - excluding the rewards and such).  Now, doing "carbon mining" thats:

QL 150 Rock - Step 1 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 2 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 3 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 4 - 750 xp

For a total of 3000 xp per rock.  The time it takes to locate the rock that is of decent QL is about the time it takes to kill 1 or 2 mobs (...and there's likely more risk in hunting carbon than there is doing "City of Home" missions).  With quick fingers, I can usually locate and process two rocks a minute.

With that in mind, it'll take roughly 73 hours of full play to go from level 150 to 151 "doing trade skills".

Unfortunately, the QL of the rocks only go up to QL 250, and most the the ones you find are in the QL 125-150 range, so most of the time you'll be getting lower xp than this.

If I wanted to go from 150-200 by "doing trade skills", my estimate is that it will take roughly 10,000 hours of game time.  And that's just 150-200...I can't image starting at CL 1!

Remember, the QL of the rocks don't improve much, nor does the xp gained from each, but the xp requirement for your next level increases geometrically.

Personally, I'd rather not dedicate my life to these skills in this manner, even though that's why I played this game in the first place...

Yes, it sucks.

sorry, but I dont believe you.

What are the odds of 1 person finding several,
while hundreds of other people can't find one?
I have killed literally thousands of Brontos.
I have done nothing else but that and Team Missions.
I have hundreds of pieces in all QLs, except this one.
I call that a bug, since it's equivilent to Carbonum
and has no reason to be rare.

There are posts on the exchange boards
offering millions for Large Hard Bronto Hide,
and no response.

So, if you really do have all these Large Hard hides,
congratulations, you're now very rich (and impossibly lucky),
but I'm afraid you may be mistaken (or maybe just trolling).

it only equips on the right shoulder(or was it left?) so you don't need 2 as you can equip only 1  
perhaps you can try and get the robot junk needed and ask in game? might be a lot easier to find an engi that way(happen to know an engi in game?)

Bump to that idea.

They should add 100 points to people who have 1+K boards.  Or something extra to tradeskills even 50 points would be good and wouldnt unbalance the game.

100 or something extra for every 500 points above 1K?  Funcom?  Hello?

RVWinkle @ 8/5/2002 11:20:29 PM (41338):
I've been spending a fair amount of time recently hunting for bronto hides outdoors and I'm fairly convinced that they don't drop outside. I've never found any bronto hides in missions but I really don't look too hard, I'm usually too busy herding my bot to the next mob. I do know that people find hides in missions since my guildies have confirmed it. So all of this came together last night when I saw 2 people in Trade the other day with bronto tunics. I didn't ask to verify but the armor does look pretty unique so it's pretty easy to recognize.

My conclusion is that while very rare it is possible to find the hides that make the tunic in missions.

Fellowman @ 8/6/2002 1:35:21 PM (37532):
Hi there.

In my opinion tradeskills should consist of 3 processes.

1. Resource gathering
2. Construction
3. Selling

The reason Anarchy Online is failing is the terrible method of "resource gathering" ie running around shops looking for the right level pieces to buy.

Mining is a great way of getting resources, and I must say that the Project Entropia method is nice for a science fiction type game.
I'd also like to see the ability for us to make the individual pieces of the gun as well (kinda think of Ultima online type constuction menus)

This would leave us with:-

1. Mining to get our resources.
2. Construction of the pieces required to make our gun and assembly of pieces, from the resources.
3. Selling gun for profit.

So....why cant we mine?

Drusillus @ 8/6/2002 9:22:34 PM (Question about finding my own Armor PPEs 42757):
Hi all,

In my mad levelling frenzy on the weekend, I foolishly surpassed the ability to do QL60 missions.  The lowest I can do now is 65.  I was wondering:

- In order to find a QL60 item such as the PPEs, will the mission have to be exactly 60, or will there be some chance of finding one in a 65 mission?

If not, I'm gonna have to get my level 19 crat up to speed, cause there's no way I can come up with 110 million to buy one off the Exchange :/

One other thing:

- Would these literally appear only in the boss' loot, or could they also be found in chests in team missions?  For example, I found a web cloak once in a chest, and I thought those were classified as "boss loot"...

Mercatura @ 8/6/2002 9:47:08 PM (41287):

Theres plenty of people out there with high EE though.

I do know making libraries over ~130 means missioning for the base item. Have to kill high bots for high robot junk too. I'm sure an egg-hunter out there has some spares that didnt quite go above ql190.

its alright to kill for food as long as its in moderation.There is a carefully worked out limit on how many can be culled as this helps and sustains the population.But what you are doing is mindless vandalism and bronto genocide.So from now on there is an embargo on killing brontos unless u have a special permit to do so.These permits can b found in the basic shops and are limited to one per person for a maximum of 2 months.There will b special Bronto Rangers checking that everyone seen killing these poor defenceless creatures has the permit otherwise this will b considered as POACHING. POACHING is considered a very serious offence on RK1 so now u have been warned.

Crazin_Azin @ 8/7/2002 11:18:06 AM (42792):
1.) Hack the suit form

2.) Get a hologram camera and an ID-Extractor. Combine them to make some "ID thingy". (the camera will be used up in the process, but the extractor will remain)

3.) Combine the "ID thingy" with the hacked suit form. This will result in a personal order form.

4. The personal form will either be clan, or omni. Combine it with a clan, or omni form found in the "bookstore's", in any supermarket. *The form from the bookstore must be opposite from the personal order form.
(clan personal+omni bookstore form = universal suit)
and of course it works both ways.

This will produce the universal crat suit, so it doesn't matter if you started with the clan or the omni form.



*note that the original form, and the hacked form are NOT NODROP, so someone else can hack it for you, if you lack the skill.

Hope you understood.

This is prolly a newbie question but well, it is something I would like to know.  I know that I can use lower ql Clusters in Implants. But how do they effect it...... ?`

i.g. I want a ql 200 imp.... but I dont find all clusters as ql 200..

how deep can I go for the cluster that it still can go in that imp ?
3 ? 4 ? 5 ? anyone know the number ?

another question.... well. a ql200 cluster for example adds 105skill. The 198one adds 100skill....... But both in an ql200 imp would make a Shining bleh blah Imp.... ql 200..... So would the imp in both cases add 105 skill ? Or would it lower the skill the ql200 imp adds when I have used lower ql clusters ?

I hope you got the point (my english issnt the best)....

Thank you for your help !

Ok thats answers the first question.... but will it add same value ?

Maximilian @ 8/7/2002 1:41:38 PM (42884):
Sorry, should read more carefully.

The determining factor is the ql of the 'final' implant, not the ql of the cluster.

If you put a ql50 cluster in a ql10 implant, the end result will be (most probabely, see below) a ql10 implant. The bonus you will get is then the one of a ql10 cluster. In your example both clusters will give 105, because you will receive a ql200 implant.

The 'final' QL of an implant can be increased while adding clusters. This (exclusively) depends on your NP skill. If you have more skill than necessary to assemble cluster and implant you'll have a certain chance to increase the ql of the implant by 1 (three clusters -> +3 ql max).

So if you start with a ql50 implant and have 400+ NP you might end with a ql52/53 implant. Important to know if you buy clusters lower in QL than the implant.

So long,

Drusillus @ 8/7/2002 3:58:26 PM (42757):
Well, I can generalize the questions:

- When doing a mission of QL X, does anyone ever find boss loot with QL less than X?

- Does "boss loot" literally only appear on the boss, or can it also appear in chests in team missions?  For example, I found a web cloak once in a chest, and I thought those were classified as "boss loot"...

Warlock @ 8/7/2002 4:26:27 PM (42757):
Dru

Since dyna camps are supposed to also use the boss loot tables, your best bet is probably to go to a level 60 dyna camp and destroy it over and over since you cant generate a QL60 mission (if you team with the lowest levels you can and they generate a mission can you not get it down to 60?)

I believe there is a good dyna camp guide on a certain guild web site you frequent :-)

Tarage @ 8/7/2002 4:26:53 PM (42757):
Web cloaks are not, and have never been boss loot. They have always been chest loot.

I have killed many a Ql58 and Ql60 bosses, and their loot varries. Sometimes it's the exactly QL of the mission, sometimes slightly higher or lower. You might be able to find a PPPE in a QL65 mission, but you might be better off leveling your crat.

Before several people confirmed that they drop from bosses, some people said that they found the PPPEs in chests and on normal MOBs. Though I don't think the chests rumor is true, it's likely that any MOBs around level 60 that drop discs, might also drop the PPPEs.

Would be nice to get a response from someone who has found one. The best I ever saw was a player said he got his off a boss in a Ql60 mission in Andromeda.

Drusillus @ 8/7/2002 4:32:39 PM (42757):
Thanks for your replies, Warlock and Tarage.

Yes I suppose teaming with a lower level player who CAN get level 60 missions will work, I'll try that out.

Elbo @ 8/7/2002 4:43:32 PM (42757):
Try leveling to 80 and then doing QL 60 missions.  You could calm your way to the boss or just area root them and blitz to the boss.

I've run about a dozen missions at QL 60.  The loot does vary in QL lvl.  Little high to right on the money QL60.

You can continue to check your level by doing a helpbot question (/tell helpbot level xx)  it will give you the mission level you can select.

It gets a little close... but it's possible to stick a QL195 implant up to 200.

QL196 is a better level to chose as the increase is pretty much guarenteed with 3 clusters installed.

On raising the QL of implants. For implants this high level the shining cluster will *probably* not result in any increase.

The Bright cluster should result in an increase of 1 - 2 levels.

The Faded cluster should result in an increase of 2 - 3 levels.

The level increases are based around the skill needed to install the particular cluster, ie Faded clusters need a lot less skill than shining clusters.

Please not that I have run into a couple of clusters for Chest implants that require way above normal NP to install. Shining clusters (of Nano Pool I believe) seem to be obscenely hard. I have built a QL172 Chest implant that required 1034NP to install the shining cluster and a QL200 Chest (which I couldn't build) which required 1200NP. However I have spoken to a GM regarding this and hopefully it is a bug that will be fixed.

NP skill defines whether the increase will happen or not. I personally have 1050NP self buffed and 1142 with an MP buff.

Just a slight addition as some of the details you have are incorrect / incomplete.

Implant QLs do not increase regardless of the programmer skill up to implant level 49 (I believe - could be slightly out on that).

You are correct that the QL increase is based on skill. But the increase for each cluster type (shining / bright / faded) is different.

These effects are a lot more noticable with higher nano programming skills.

Also the increase is more pronounced in higher level implants.

Taken from the perspective of 1k+ NP and 3 clusters per implant these are the results I would expect:

QL1 - 49: No QL increase
QL50 - 109: 1 - 3 QL increase
QL110 - 180: 1 - 6 QL increase
QL180 - 200: 1 - 5 QL increase

As a break down of this... While building a QL 125 implant with 3 clusters to be installed this is what I would expect:

QL125 implant + Shining Cluster: 1 QL increase
QL126 implant + Bright Cluster: 2 QL increase
QL128 implant + Faded Cluster: 3 QL increase

Resulting in a QL131 implant.

The reason for the different increase is due to the skills required to install each cluster; ie a faded cluster requires a lot less skill than a shining cluster.

As it stands now, Nano armor is inferior to the other high-end armors for all
professions but MPs. The near total lack of Int and Psy buffs leaves Nano 
armor wearers with lagging ACs and no bonus to show for it. And the cloaks are
utterly useless. This is unfortunate, as Nano armor is the second coolest 
looking armor in game.

Nano armor should be a better choice for nanomages and nanoformula heavy 
classes. But how to achieve this?

The simple method would be to add skill or ability bonuses. a boost of 50 to 
all nano-skills at QL 200 would be very nice, right?

Wrong. We do not need to add to the buff-inflation that is pushing FC into 
(misguided) level locking.

Instead, we should take our cue from some rather underused items in the game:
The belt deck upgrade items.
 Computer Deck Range Increaser.
 Hardcore CPU Upgrade.
 NCU Coolant Sink.
 Nano Formula Recompiler.

These are all quite nice items, but very underutilized, in my experience, due
to the fact that we can never get enough NCU space.

So, how to put the lime in the coconut and shake it all up?
(Lime in the coconut and shake it all up! Lime in the coconut and shake it all
up! *smacks self*)


Build an "Activated Connective Matrix" (as mentioned in my previous post). 
Combine this with the deck upgrade. This produces an "Activated *deck component*.
Description mentions that "This item is now wired for addition to some other piece
of equipment. This is a tradeskill item.".

Next we need to prep the armor. Two possibilities spring to mind here: Either
you hack open the Nano Armor's exoskeleton (Hacking tool, B&E) or we do it in
a more controlled way (Dunno, need ideas.)

This turns the Nano Armor into "Destructured Nano Armor" (hey, I'm running out 
of name ideas here, cut me some slack). It is either no longer useable as armor
or has all of it's ACs cut in half.

Then add the "Activated *deck component*" to the "Destructured Nano Armor".
This would produce different things, depending on the upgrade added.
Computer Deck Range Increaser: "Enhanced Nano Armor, Range".
Hardcore CPU Upgrade: "Enhanced Nano Armor, CPU".
NCU Coolant Sink: "Enhanced Nano Armor, Supercooled".
Nano Formula Recompiler: "Enhanced Nano Armor, Recompiler".

However, since the deck upgrades require Comp Lit skill to use, so must Enhanced
Nano Armor. (Gotta keep it fair.) I'd recommend around 2/3 of the comp lit required
to use the actual belt upgrade. So the Recompiler armor would require about 530 Comp
Lit at QL 200.

The bonuses on these should be structured so that wearing a full suit of Enhanced
Nano Armor provides the same bonuses as using a deck component. (IE, full set of
QL 200 Recompiler armor provides 400 nano init.)

Ok just a little tip.

I know PPPE has dropped in two ql 60 team missions near MMD.
The guy who found them did like 50 team missions for them so it´s a lot of work.

I hope it will drop more often in the future cuz prices are getting insane on rare loot.

Destractor @ 8/8/2002 5:50:10 PM (42757):
Seem's easier to get 100m creds to buy a ppe than to find people low enough to get the missions and blitz through them.

sadly i did pay 110mil for mine wish i could tell where to get 1 cause i would get 1 myself(the 1 i dont have) . anyway makes ya wonder if Fc realizes there kinda causeing people to use that credit exploit by makeing these items so rare of a drop. But the best detail i can give you that i heard was it (hard armor) dropped off a claw. if it was boss or not i do not know.

I have found that their are many types of each of the animals. My very first sighting of a Primal Chirop made me respect these little birds much much more. So, maybe there is a type of Bronto that you have not yet found. I have some pieces of bronto hide myself all from boss loot/team mission chests. When I get in game tonight I'll check to see what kind they are, and if they are Large Hard bronto hides I'm a happily rich man

You might want to keep in mind that there are about 7 slots for most armor, followed by shoulder slots, a neck slot, an I don't remember what on the other side, (the picture I referred to instead of logging in has a flashlight there), two wrist, and two finger slots.

There are 4 deck components you mentioned.  Which three armor slots don't get deck components?  Or are you saying I could walk around with the advantages of 7 hardcore NCU upgrades if I wanted?

Could make the armor reflect melee.  "plasma charged armor:  This armor is charged with a 'skin' of energy.  Anyone disrupting it, as with a weapon, receives a reminder that this person is hands off"  Have you ever wanted to wire a cattle prod to your jacket?  If you don't know what a cattle prod is, how about a stun gun?  In fact the breathing space would be perfect for this "modification".

How about tying in a cloaking device?  antigrav module?

How about a helmet that reduces all tradeskills, and trap-disarm, B&E, and perception, but buffed all the combat skills by 66% of the reduction?  A real helmet of Mars.  Turn a crafter into a warrior.

That's what I want to see.  Just in time for this game to get metaphysical.  Boots of Mercury.  Flight and a pretty good run-speed boost.  (Then we can talk a reflect melee shield, and go hunting medusas.)

Gack, no!

The bonuses on these should be structured so that wearing a full suit of Enhanced 
Nano Armor provides the same bonuses as using a deck component. (IE, full set of 
QL 200 Recompiler armor provides 400 nano init.)


So, for example, each piece could provide 58 nano init. Or the bonuses could vary, based on the size of the piece of armor. Or each of the deck upgrades could be biased towards a particular part of the body:
Most of the nano init bonus being in the chest, range increase mainly in the gloves, CPU/Nano cost decrease in the helmet, coolant sink/interrupt suppression in the pants. This would let players assemble a good "bit of everything" suit or totally max out the capabilities in one direction.

And my fear is that if we say we want the ability to make all new armor sorts, it'll take forever to get those armor types (the devs have to have time to figure out what attributes would be balanced) and we'd never get around to making existing armor types.

New items prolly have to go through some long process, prolly  involving viking battle axes and a lot of mead to get approval . And then there's the actual coding time to implement it. Where as right now, there are tons of completed armors types which lack any type of tradeskill process whatsoever.

I also think people maybe overcomplicating things on the development side of things. Take plasteel armor, for example. How hard would it be to:
 Create an item similiar to the precious metal reclaimer and make it useable on Robot junk to yield Raw Plasteel. Make the Raw Plasteel able to be combined with a Shining/Bright/Faded Nanocluster of Cold Protection to yeild Raw Chilled Plasteel. Make the Raw Chilled Plasteel combinable with the HSR - Etch and Sketch <armor location> to yield Etched Pattern for Chilled Plasteel <armor location> Make the Etched Pattern for Chilled Plasteel <armor> combinable with the Mass Relocating Robot (Shape Hard Armor) to yeild Chilled Plasteel Armor <armor location>

And I checked the prices on the nanoclusters. A QL 1 Faded Nanocluster of Cold Protection has a value of 350, according to Antiguardians. A QL 1 Bright Nanocluster of Cold Protection has a value of 700 according to Antiguardians. And a shining cluster is 1650. The most expensive piece of chilled plasteel body armor is QL 1 Inferior Chilled Plasteel Body Armor at a value of 1100. While the gloves cost 275 as the least expensive. Depending on how they want to balance out the costs, pick whichever cluster they want (I'd suggest the Faded to balance out the time factor of aquiring the parts/getting someone to assemble it).

Wanna get fancy? To make Sekutek Chilled Plasteel Armor, make sure the raw chilled plasteel can accept another component, hopefully one that can be pulled out of something else (like a skilled person using a screwdriver on high QL Robot junk pulls temperature regulator out of it).

Edit PS
To make Heated Plasteel Armor, swap the nanocluster of cold protection for the nanocluster of fire protection. The sealed weapons recepticles show it's possible to make items that accept different components yeilding different items. And items like the Nano Programming Interface show it's possible to have wearable items that give bonuses and have those  items as components in tradeskill processes (NCU Hackers Interface).

secondkenlon @ 8/9/2002 2:30:38 AM (39315):
Making armor types with implants seems simpler, but I doubt it actually would be.


Making new components/items/nanos seems to be EASIER for Funcom than modifying old ones. Why this is, I dunno, but their steadfast refusal to upgrade old weapons (instead, making new ones) seems to show this.

If nanoclusters were used in making armor, the programmers would have to modify the item database, and I doubt they'll do it.

Plus, if nano-clusters were used, the logical skill to install them would be nano-programming and there is already enough call for that skill in the game.

All the others need some good uses.

Sean-Roach @ 8/9/2002 3:57:18 AM (39315):
Before I start, I should make something perfectly clear.  Everything below this line is rank speculation.

Okay, unless I miss my guess, items don't involve any programming at all, just some database work.  So, making an item equipable for one buff, and making it an ingredient only means it's in two databases instead of one.

Think of the process from the perspective of the machine, and not the perspective of the player.

Your perspective.
You combine two objects, and get a third.  You might get to keep the tool.

Machines perspective.
Player applies item1 to item2.  check the database on item1 and sure enough, there's an entry that goes item1+ item2 -> item3.  Take item1, and item 2, provide item3.  BUT WAIT, THIS entry actually goes item1 + item2 -> item3 & Item1.  So STILL take both the initial items, but give them item1 "back", and a new item.

Actually it probably goes something like this, 
item1(n)+item2(n(.5)) ->item3(n).  

Or maybe 
IF 2m >= n (item1(m)+item2(n)->item3(n), item1(m))
If the tool QL is at least half of the QL of the item, replace both with a new item at the QL of the item, and a tool of the original QL of the tool.

At this point my speculation gets a bit carried away as I try to re-invent a robust and flexible system to handle the tradeskill system.

The problem is probably indoing the authoring, not programming, and then balancing the things.  How much is too difficult?  How much is too easy?  What should the cost be at each step?  Also remember that these aren't isolated circumstances, (well, the QL1 only nano programming interface is probably an isolated circumstance), so you can't just say xxx cred sounds about right, you have to say (xxx * QL) +modifier sounds about right and works for a QL 1 item, and a QL 200 item.

Also, each piece has to be described, (and you know we'd jump down their throats if they deigned to leave so much as a TYPO in the description, much less a flat out error,) and either tied to an existing image and 3D model, or a new image, (and maybe 3D model), has to be designed from scratch.

The reason they probably prefer doing new stuff, is fear of having two items in the database that result from the same recipe, only the first would be consulted, or they might be concerned that they might suddenly gimp a whole swath of guns, or overpower them.  Either way imbalancing gameplay.  In the first case, the owners of that weapon complain, in the second, everyone else complains.

Again, everything above this line is merely my speculation.

secondkenlon @ 8/9/2002 6:06:11 AM (39315):
What we really need is to know how the game sees each item (is the tradeskill nature of an item encoded into it's database entry, or into the database entry for the recipe? etc, etc)

Then we could know what they can and cannot do, and make useful suggestions.

Problem is though people keep demanding new items to make. I used to be an admin on a lpmud and dealt specifically with balance there. New content is usually hard to get approval for and is usually a long process. New items have to be evaluated against current availible items and against future development plans before any even begins to code them (or at least I hope FC does this). 

Adaptions on already implemented content are usually easier to get done. And since we're discussing a process to make already existing items and not new items themselves, it should be a 1 time debate over the balance of the tradeskill process. And once the rules are set (ie: armor with xxx value should cost yyy in components to make), it never has to be revisited again

like the trainer will give a offer lets say "hey i bet 100k that my student or fighter can beat your" 
And the trainer may not even have to do anything but give his fighter buffs 
Or the student can ask a high lvl proffesion to be his trainer an pay the trainer for getting him fights and theynbothh can make money that way there will be no ganking and it will get lower lvls more into pvp and make higher lvls that have that are bored have fun helping an making a good an well known fighter hey even the trainers can fight plzz give me your input and tell me wat you think or add opinions "I Personaly think it would be interesting and really fun plus we can give big tornaments" hey since funcom wont make AO fun we can make it Rock plzz help me to get this to work hehe

I am looking for any info on the Unilateral Disc Computer, and or making a Modified Agression Enhancer, it is a Impact damage reflector device. 

I have located both items in a couple of the online databases, and am trying to get the parts by working backwards from the item discription.

So far I have not found the computer in any of the omni basic trade skill machines, my best guess is it needs to be crafted from other parts or is only available in a special shop, but I haven't the cash to play all day in there trying to find it either. 

If anyone could be of help I would be grateful, thanks.

This is a great idea. Not only will it create more interaction between people but we can get people with PVP titles that really mean something.

they come from ql60 team missions. boss mob drop only. rare. I ran over 100 ql60 missions solo with my high lvl... no drop. ill try some more later. The hard shape ones are good for making Carbonium armour though, ands that stuff is uber. The soft shape ones make Bronto armour

It's all third class junk to us at high levels because we can take on mobs for uber armors. But there is room for this stuff at low to mid level and it promotes people to creating tradeskill character who you need to make the high level gear as well. 

Plus as I said, the armors in the game have already gone through whatever approval process FC has for items (they better have an approval system cause even the muds I was a coder/admin on in the 90s had content approval systems).

Also I think you drastically overlook the appeal of being able to get QL xxx items when you want them. I know I was considering using MCS with my trader because of that. If they created some bow tradeskill weapons, I'd definately make my own bows.

And finally, your thinking leans very heavily towards a mentality which usually end up working against tradeskill systems. So long as the items that you want are the uber items, developers tend to do everything in their power to control how many of those items can be made. So think to yourself: Do I want a tradeskill system that will be loaded rare item drops, unique mobs, and heavily defended areas?

Wibol @ 8/10/2002 5:06:05 PM (39315):
If it costs even half what it costs to make carb those lower and mid levels cant afford anyway

Not to mention ip cost of skills

ip is so tight it would be lucky if 70 trader could make 40 armor without being paper tissue for yellow mob

Discs need to not be rare as they are now for sure! 

I never even considered tradeskill until ip reset

No trader should try hard until 160 at least

Engys can try earlier maybe but hard to get levels in mission when bots so dumb and you have no evades

Outdoors bad at 100 when engy can try tradeskills

So still ends up 150 or more for serious tradeskill

Leveling without mobs not fun 

Getting sets is not hard now either
Lots of people just blitz for a suit
I remember when it was a big deal if you blitzed a 35 omni pol or 75 elite
Now its not 

You can call it mentality but its common sense
Its why noone over level 10 uses 3/4ths of weapons out there
Armor at least only has 6 skills to choose from and something better than nothing

Tradeskill armor should be left to good types

Id rather have no new armor and put coders on the 5000 bugs than able to make crappy armor already in game

Also fixing bugged items should always be first before making crap armor tradeskill crafting!

So many guns have melee init and such

Carbonums is rather special armor. (enormous ACs and NCU bonuses.) It should be more expensive to make than normal armor.

No kidding. They should be purchasable in shops, frankly.

This might give you the clue that you aren't really part of the intended audience for these changes. There are people out there who, even with the broken state of tradeskills today, have invested plenty of time and IP in them. That's who these changes are for.

The reason I decided to tackle armopr crafting before proposing a weapon rebalance is that armor is simple. Requirements vs ACs.

Guns are much more complex, especially since FC won't tell us how the init formulas and the special recharge time works.

I would, however, love to see patch notes like this:

15.X:
Focus: Weapon rebalancing. 

Forget adding anything else, just devote a full patch cycle to making all the weapon types useful (melee energy, anyone? Rifle/Burst? Grenade? Piercing (other than Claws)? Pure AR attack rating weapons? Heavy Weapons? Shotgun/Burst?)

Just doing that would rock! (And the ensuing arguments about "What weapon is the best *now*" would liven up my life, especially if Funcom took care to make sure that there are many viable QL 200 weapons. . .  )

From: CowerFool  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a very simple trade skill that only requires (oddly enough , perhaps for the sake of bow-users) agility . 

1 - Obtain Arrowheads and Reet-Tech Metaplast Arrowshafts from the Ranged Component shop .

2 - Combine them together ! Now you have your arrows !

- Steel Arrowhead - Normal Arrows - Makes 25
- Radiation Arrowhead - Apple Seed Special Arrows - Makes 10
Seems to taunt your enemy , as suggested by its description , not confirmed
- Chemical Arrowhead - Needle Pine Special Arrows - Makes 20
Not sure of its special function
- Poison Arrowhead - Poison Bamboo Special Arrows - Makes 20
At QL 4 Poison Bamboo adds deals 42 damage 
- Fire Arrowhead - Not sure , i have not been able to try it due to my lack of funds :-( and its minimum QL seem to be 120
- Frost Arrowhead - Not sure as well , minimum QL seem to be 60

The usage of all special arrows require nano points , like MA skills .
The agility required seem to be something like [Percentage of average QL of the two components (out of QL 200)] X 550 .

Making normal arrows yourself are much cheaper than buying them from shops , by saving at least 75% from what the components i have got . 
 
From: Tarage1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
I went ahead and made some Fire and Frost Arrows.

Fire Arrowheads - Fire damage arrows, QL132 does 345 - 990 points of fire damage, requires 401 Bow Special attack - Makes 20

Frost Arrowheads - Not sure what it does, "Your shelter blows away." - Makes 20

I tried to add the Ql120 Fire Arrowhead to a Ql71 Reet-Tech Metaplast Arrowshafts and it didn't take. What is weird is that it didn't give me an error of any kind, it just wouldn't combine them. Then, I went to a Sup shop and got some QL175 Arrowshafts, which game me a QL error. I needed at least QL157 Fire Arrowheads to combine them with QL175 Arrowshafts. Meaning that the QL of the arrows takes on the QL of the Arrowshafts. I then tried adding the QL120 Arrowheads to QL151 Arrowshafts, but needed QL135 Arrowheads.

So, it looks like QL of Arrowhead / .90 will give you about the highest QL of Arrowshaft you can get.

A: Frist make the trade skill items in game work , id say atleast 80 percent of the newer weapons both melee and ranged do not work.

B: make the PPPEs easier to obtain heck put them in shops for 10 mill each , but sticking them on q 60ish boss mobs is the wrong place . Not to mention the uber rarity of the items allow 1-2 percent of the people that can actually use them to have them . 

C: After A&B are done then try adding new items.

Ferria @ 8/12/2002 5:31:28 AM (39315):
Actually the more i think about i would geuss the best thing that could happen to weapon smithing is to remove all the current formulas and replace them . There is no sellabilty or use for 99 percent of it period . The one exception would be mausers other than that delete it . Sorry not trying to sound harsh  but if no one will use them whats the point , not to mention all the free space it would make for new items . 

 Trade skills are just that items that can be made to be sold or traded for another item . At the moment there is very little that is a viable trade item . 

Weapons : Other than muaser none of the current weapons are player used above level 20 . Need a serious revamp here adding weapons that can actually be sold and used . Adding the ability to modify the current in game weapons would also be an idea .

Armor : PPPE's are so rare that if one percent of the entire classes that can use them have the it would be alot . The ability to create and modify other armors would be a welcome addition. Then again with the rarity of the pppes/instuction disks , not sure thats a good idea.

Rings: not in game

Viral eggs: good item but the overal rarity of the items to make it do not allow it to be a great trade item.

Nano formulas : While a good idea , there is little demand for these . Possibly making new nanos added to the game instruction disk only.

Implants: Decent trade skill item , can make a fair amout of money if you have 1000 skill . Possibly add the ability to make the actual basic empty implant it self.

Treatment/stims : Though they are nice i see very few people selling and even less inquring about them . Adding Nano chargers would be a good idea .

 Overall at this time i personally think the whole trade skill system needs to be totally reworked . Being an engineer it would be nice to actually put my skills to some use .

I know the PPPE is like rocking horse doo doo, but can anyone (whos actually made armour) post a detailed description

The bit I'm mainly interested in is do you need 1 piece of raw material (e.g. patch of bronto hide) for each armour section or will one piece make the lot?

Also is the proactical difference (in terms of armour making) between a patch of bronto hide, and a _small_ oatch of bronto hide?

Thanks

Kzak @ 8/12/2002 9:37:07 AM (43959):
I haven't got the PPPE, but from skimming auno.org's database, it would appear that you need one piece of hide for every armor piece you intend to make.

And yes, the description of the piece of hide does have a meaning for which armor part it can be used for. Use Tanning Acid (found in pharmaceutical dept., tradeskill-section) on the piece of hide, and the description will reveal what can be made from the tanned hide.

Tarage @ 8/13/2002 4:29:01 AM (43959):
I have no experience with hard armor, as I STILL dont have a hard armor PPPE :[

Bronto Armor

You combine B.B.I. - Nano Enhanced B-12 Tanning Acid (which you buy from the Chemistry Shop in the Tradeskill section of any store) with any peice of Bronto Hide. This will result in the hide becomming tanned. You then combine Mass Relocating Robot (Shape Soft Armor) with the tanned hide to produce the peice of Bronto Armor. Combining the MRR does not cause it to disappear. You will always have the MRR, and it is reusable. The process uses 100% Chemistry at 4.5x the QL, so QL200 requires 900 Chemistry. It requires the same amount of chemistry for both steps.

Large Patch of Hard Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Tunic
Large Patch of Soft Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Legwear
Patch of Hard Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Boots
Patch of Soft Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Sleeves
Small Patch of Hard Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Hood
Small Patch of Soft Bronto Hide = Bronto Hide Gloves

Dragon Armor

This is easier, as there is no tanning process. You simply combine the MRR with the Dragon peice. This is probably also done with Chemistry at 4.5x QL. Since they only come in QL100 it would only require 450. 

Shard of Living Dragon Skull = Living Dragonskull Circlet
Chunk of Living Dragon Flesh = Living Dragonflesh Body Armor
Piece of Living Dragon Wing = Living Dragonwing Arms Armor
Patch of Living Dragon Skin = Living Dragonskin Legs Armor
Lump of Living Dragon Marrow = Living Dragonmarrow Feet Armor

It is extremely important that you do not have any piece of dragon armor in your inventory or equipment while doing this! With the exception of the sleeves, the dragon armor is UNIQUE. If you already have a unique item in your inventory, and you make the same unique item, the new item you make will simply vanish and be lost forever. 

NOTE: This is changing in 14.5, at which time Dragon Armor will no longer be UNIQUE.

NanoKiss @ 8/13/2002 4:30:33 AM (41476):

Kzak @ 8/13/2002 8:24:14 AM (43959):
The Etch-a-Sketch is only used on hard armor, to determine which part shall be made from the raw material. Try it out yourself, by buying a low-QL sheet of Carbonum plating, buy one of the Etchers, and combine the etcher on the carbonum. Voila, the plating is now cut (sketched?), ready to be MRR'ed.

To get a 'Metal*' Filigree Ring you have to extract and melt down some jewelry (almost all type of rings and bracers can be used), use a wire drawing machine on the molten metal and then a generic ring template. (for detailed description please refer to The Workshop)

* Silver/Gold/Platinum

Now you can add any gem to it, preferably cut before (exception Blue Pearl by Conner and Silver Onyx). For cutting (and polishing) you need this device: Jensen Gem Cutter. Now you simply combine the two and have your self made ring. Silver is not worth the effort (was changed recently  ), gold so lala, and Platinum I can't tell you, but sells best.

Limiting skill is Mechanical Engineering (ME) and you need about ql x 5 to combine ring and gem. Nice detail, determining ql is the filigree ring, so you can boost the value of the end product a bit by this.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Billy Talent @ 8/13/2002 2:44:04 PM (41476):
Since we are on the subject of rings who has a clear understanding of what rings of luck do?

Destractor @ 8/13/2002 2:56:35 PM (41476):
pah, another item that should have been trade skills becomes another highly unlikely boss drop. woohoo

Come on, trade skills give so many possibilities, and time on time they are not used. 

Oh well guess trade skills have been dumped in the bin along with adventuring. 

Guess I was hoping too much for the game. Back to those missions again it is, so that I can gain levels so that I can ....? hmm fail to build higher quality cool stuff.

Mercatura @ 8/13/2002 3:29:00 PM (41476):
I'm well aware they're nodrop.


	
		
			
			
				My guess was you get a blank through a quest or something and have someone build you a part to combine with the blank.
			
		
	
BTW, guess what else is nodrop but made via tradeskills?(technically)

Crat Suit
Personal Lockpick

Dragon Falcour @ 8/13/2002 5:19:26 PM (41476):
Well I guess regardless of it's Drop/NODROP status, the answer is there. Jim himself has quite rudely informed us that we cannot build these rings and are not planning on making them a tradeskill item.

As a new surfer to these forums and a long-time AOer first I apologize for the inappropriate posting Jim and am not impressed with your lack of respect for an honest query.

Tarage @ 8/13/2002 5:34:18 PM (41476):
Jim's post was not rude, and was 100 times more information than Funcom usually ever gives us. I applaud him for his post, as he really didn’t need to say anything on the subject at all.

Its a shame you felt his reply was rude, because you'll probably end up canceling your account in disbelief after you deal with an ARK or GM when you lose your first item in game.

Razorbak133 @ 8/13/2002 5:46:51 PM (38377):
I would love to join into this.  I am lvl 175 trader.  I have all my trade skills maxed (except Pharma tech which is 500 but will soon be maxed).

I can make nanos up to ql181 with buffs only or 220 with implants, can make weapon recepticles (have to get a small B&E buff cause I am 7 points short), can overtune tank armor, make coffee makers, could make armor if I had the PPPE tool, and can make treatment libraries with a small B&E buff.

Gridfan @ 8/13/2002 5:47:48 PM (Specialist Missions 44290):
misions are. boring in current implementation.
Picture this.


You get a mission. it's a sniper mission.
You get hold of agent for you team. (or if you ar a agent you could just solo etc).

You go to mission location, buff up. Then sneak inside.
(or it could be in the outdoors?)
There is a time limit. not too short, but certainly not long enough to just hang around either.
You sneak in, thru dangerous areas, traps and enemies.
Find target. kill him as silently as possible.
100% sucess. You sneak back out as careully as you sneaked inside. And you are sucessful. 1 target down and nobody saw you. tata you get a extra bonus due to sneaking outside.
If you where in a team the team could stand guard outside and ready to "rescue" you if needed if things go wrong etc.


Now lets take a Doc. Same type of mission. only this time.
The doc need to make sure the target stays ALIVE for X amount of minutes after the target has been located.
solo or Team would bring different angles on this as well.

Adventurers. Going somewhere, having to locate a area or person. location unknown. area aproximated etc.

Fixers, hack into a secure building and get a secret item.

Traders, need to make a special/illegal/unique item (and find the parts needed to build it)

And so on, and so on.

I'd like to call these Specialist Missions. And is something AO REALLY REALLY needs.
And this is just autogenerated. Later maybe one could tie in (without the players knowing) some of these randomly.
So a Doc may find himself having to keep a person alive which a Agent is on the way to kill. (and neiter the Doc nor the Agent is aware of this. well unless it's a team variant and they have scouts/guards etc  If these missions was in 25% areas it would make interesting entrance battles. And ended with a fierce fight to keep target alive/kill target.

Ppl your gonna hate me for this. But what I just suggested would make a nice Booster Pack as well imo.
Esp if setup properly so GM's etc could slip in some "handmade" Specialist Missions in among the "regular" ones.

So what ya all think? Specialist Missions ?
(right now any profession can do the same type of missions as any other profession which kinda kills the concept of different professions imo)

Dragon Falcour @ 8/13/2002 6:09:20 PM (41476):
lol that is very kind of you for your defense and I applaud your intensity. If I am out of line I apologize again I am unaccustomed to being addressed in such an abrubt manner.

As for Arks and GM's they have always provided me with a speedy response and solution to my questions/bug issues. They have even to my surprise tracked me down through my alts in game and were able to provide me the info. necessary to resolve an issue while being flamed publicly by a barage of rude and angry children. 

I would never consider giving up the relationships made and progress acheived for something as petty as an item loss. 

In any case once again this is not the appropriate thread for this discussion and I will not be posting here any longer on either of the before mentioned topics.

Mercatura @ 8/13/2002 6:27:33 PM (41476):
I'm just sad that my second (and very cynical, due to prior experience) guess is probably correct.

OK well thanks folks this was a thread asking a question about Tradeskills. Now it has turned into a flame match. If I had wanted to have a RP session in a thread Etan I would have posted in the Roleplay section of the forums not the tradeskill section.

If you don't want people killing Bronto's go post there not here. I just want to know if the rarerity of the Large hard piece of bronto hide is intended or a bug and if it drops at all. I have heard that a couple of chest pieces have been made so it just seems to be extremely rare if so this is FUBAR and should be fixed to drop as often as the other pieces.

coldwarkid @ 8/14/2002 10:11:09 AM (44290):
I think it's a great idea. It's been suggested before now in one format or another, but it's always worthy of support. I liked the idea of introducing it as a booster pack, although since most of the work will be done on the server side I'm not sure a booster is strictly necessary. However, if it means that FC are more likely to actually implement it, I'm all in favour.

Engineer mission: The mission terminal starts you off with a component and a manual. You have to find the rest of the components inside the mission, assemble them and use the completed assembly on a device which gives you access to the actual mission objective. Skill checks against all the engineering tradeskills along the way, including chemistry but not including pharma tech.

Trader mission: similar to the engineer mission, except that the final check is against psychology as the trader uses the completed item to bribe his way past an NPC, either trading it for the mission objective or simply gaining access to the final rooms.

In team missions these specialist mission objectives could be combined so that the team has to go through several stages before finally getting to complete.

Cheers,

~R~

..is a tradeskill which isn't used a lot, at least commonly.

You can build aggro-trimmers for Engineer-bots with it, but I think you also need Mechanical Engineering.

Also, Chemistry is important for constructing armor, should you be so ultra-fortunate or filthy rich enough to get hold of the Programmed Photon Particle Emitters with Shape Soft or Shape Hard Armor, respectively. Also, I believe that Computer Literacy is another tradeskill important for armor creation. I don't have any of the PPPEs, so I can't tell for sure. Look up the Tradeskills board for some more info.

Kzak @ 8/14/2002 2:01:35 PM (42757):
BrutalThug, did you do a single-mission or a team-mission when you found the PPPE?

As far as I know, the PPPEs have been confirmed to drop as boss loot, though the mission can be higher than QL60.

coldwarkid @ 8/14/2002 3:24:53 PM (44481):
It occasionally shows up as a requirement in weaponsmithing as well, but it's not common. I'd suspect it plays a role in making stims and treatment kits also. I can't really think of any tradeskill where chemistry is the primary requirement though.

Cheers,

I am level 154 and max trade skills every level, also with the 1k token board I have the extra 210+ to NP and comp lit.

I guess this would be more of a way to get buffs or somebody with slightly higher skills when needed.

Jica

and um...not many more I'm sure

Maybe a dozen or two total at best? A lot of them are snapping up the pppes and not uttering a peep, probably keeping work in-house.

Overtuning tank armour is dead easy, I do it myself for my doc, I think overtuning ql130ish tank takes something like 120 elec engineering and a neutron displacer.

Its also 48 played hours before it disintegrates, by which time you're well above the level where you might even consider wearing that piece of tank.  And as far as I can tell, tank armour doesn't sell for much anyway (the normal stuff anyway).

I really recommend overtuning tank armour, the removal of nano penalties apart from a little nano init is a real bonus.

I paid 4-5M in the shop at level 70 to get my nano creation tools. I did not mind, since they were one-time investments; expensive at the time, but I was buying quality tools. 

I would like it to be similar for the armor PPPE's - expensive, but not ridiculously so.

Sidenote: Ironically, when the cost of making nanos was reduced in the recent patch, the value of my quality tools was reduced to 2% of the original investment.

Heya all...

I just title maxed most of my trade skills.. and i was thinking about building some sealed weapons for friend and just for fun...
I know i need Break and entry..... i have 700 in it, which is enough for ql200 sealeds.... The only problem i have is to find the right part to assemble to gun. 
Does anyone know a homepage or something with some kind of list, which item  is required to build the certain kind of sealed...
For example. Soft pepper pistol requires a nano pylon....
Imi tellus a flak tubing and so...
dont know the others tho :/

Another question i have is about those construction kits.. I treid to build some guns.. but they got bugged while building... sometimes in die first 2 steps. but mostly i couldnt do the last step to finish it.. Are all of them bugged? Or only a part of them?
does any list exists to look up what i CAN build right now?

thx for any answers =)

Kzak @ 8/16/2002 1:37:54 PM (45017):
For the guide to sealed weapon receptacles, go to:

Virral's site 

Look up the Guides section to find the page about receptacles.

As for weapon construction kits, a good many of them are bugged to the point that you can't complete the weapon. Some have begun mapping out which ones are bugged and which ones aren't, but that's going to take a while before everything has been mapped.

Technically, they didn't lie about being able to level from tradeskills alone.  You can, and I've done it.  

However, it is insanely boring and not what I had expected from Anarchy Online.

As most trade skill items are useless, and the demand for the "good stuff" exists in the materials, NOT the finished product, really, it's all muddled.

For example, you can walk into a shop and buy carbonum plating, but need to have a CL 60 alt run a few hundred team missions just to get the PPPE to make anything of it.  Of course, you could always buy it, but that's just silly (I saw one going for 100 million the other day - for a QL 60 item!).

Anyway, yes, you can level off tradeskills (not suggested).  Max your "Mechanical Engineer", "Electrical Engineering", "Nano Programming", "Field Quantum Pysics", and "Computer Literacy" (not all required for the basic steps, but all needed to be a good Nano Program Builder).  Implant the hell out of these skills, and get the basic items that buff them.  Buy your tools.

Now, go out to a 25% zone (!) that contains carbon-rich rocks, and have fun clicks a million times.

At level 150, it takes roughly 13 million to level.  Doing missions, that's about 370 kills (assuming 35k a kill - excluding the rewards and such).  Now, doing "carbon mining" thats:

QL 150 Rock - Step 1 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 2 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 3 - 750 xp
QL 150 Rock - Step 4 - 750 xp

For a total of 3000 xp per rock.  The time it takes to locate the rock that is of decent QL is about the time it takes to kill 1 or 2 mobs (...and there's likely more risk in hunting carbon than there is doing "City of Home" missions).  With quick fingers, I can usually locate and process two rocks a minute.

With that in mind, it'll take roughly 73 hours of full play to go from level 150 to 151 "doing trade skills".

Unfortunately, the QL of the rocks only go up to QL 250, and most the the ones you find are in the QL 125-150 range, so most of the time you'll be getting lower xp than this.

If I wanted to go from 150-200 by "doing trade skills", my estimate is that it will take roughly 10,000 hours of game time.  And that's just 150-200...I can't image starting at CL 1!

Remember, the QL of the rocks don't improve much, nor does the xp gained from each, but the xp requirement for your next level increases geometrically.

Personally, I'd rather not dedicate my life to these skills in this manner, even though that's why I played this game in the first place...

Yes, it sucks.

Sadly, level 150-151 is what I would say "meager" xp required.. that's like what, 7 or 8 million? 

Versus 70 mill or so required.. for all the last levels. Occording to your calculations it'd take around 730 hours to level once, so the last 15 levels  take your estimated 10,000 hours alone.

I have never like title caps on anything to begin with. Just a piss poor way of trying to bring some balance to the class's by limiting the nano line/equipment you can use. 

The big arguement for them is that they (title caps) cause you to place IP in skills you wouldn't normally do.  But I would still have preferred more flexibility in my char developement. After all its the journey thats important because once you hit lvl 200 everyone ends up being the "same".

Personally I would have enjoyed this game much more without Title caps. As an engineer I found it exceptionally frustrating having my TS and MC capped. Running around for 195 lvls looking for a MP to buff you just plain sucks.  If I want to be a brainiac Engineer and max my TS and MC let me.  I would also have rather seen you continously get IP points as you gain (and save) experience. Heck at lvl 181 I need 40 million exp to get more IP now. It would have been more interesting to me to complete a mission netting 1.5 to 2 million exp, go save it and now have another 5000 IP points to allocate. While this would help with the high lvl grind it wouldn't fix it. 

Anyway I have grown pretty disgusted with my engineer. Not so much from his ability to do missions. Heck I can easily do solo Broken Shore mission at 50% all the way up to lvl 200. But that is just to boring for me to complete. He just doesn't really seem to fit in to game. To do any trade skill stuff you have throw in specialized implants and hunt down a trader/doc for the buffs. Whats the point ... so much hassle. And the experience for doing that is just pure crap. 

For me I have grown tired of this game for now. I no longer have expectations they will fix many fundelmental problems. I hope Funcom did manage to learn some things from producing AO ... perhaps thier future endeavors will be better.

coldwarkid @ 8/16/2002 3:24:01 PM (45017):
We started putting together a list of bugged and non-bugged manuals here. Not all of the information has been collated at the top of the thread unfortunately, and the effort pretty much ground to a halt when we realised that a the same manual might work at one QL and not at another, and that the exact choice of QL for your components might cause kits of the same QL to behave differently.

You might also want to check out this site, which has an ongoing effort to catalogue kits by individual QL. Might take a while though...

Elbo @ 8/16/2002 5:20:53 PM (45051):
Track down any high level fixer.  They will hack it open for you.  After that you'll need the "part" that is missing.    If you have it remember it must be a high level part since the gun will become the QL lvl of the part...(IE: dont get a QL150 part..)

I can put any lvl gun together easy :-)

 People complained about a first come first serve basis with targeting scopes. people said that the people with the old items would be too 'uber'. Funcom fixes something within that extent as possibly part of the Bracer nerf and now everyone is all whiney again. Pick - old rare uber items or balance...

Dont fall down the stairs and hurt yourself really badly now will you

Tarage @ 8/17/2002 6:11:14 PM (43959):
Ok....

I am assuming Carbonum and Notum are the same

Take your peice of Sheet of Curved Carbonum Plating, or Notum Saturated Metaplast Shell, and then use anyone of six HSR - Sketch and Etch devices on it. This step requires Chemistry at 4.5x the QL of the sheet. You then take your new Etched Pattern and use your Mass Relocating Robot (Shape Hard Armor) on it. This step requires Mechanical Engineering at 4.5x the QL of the Etched Pattern. This will result in your completed piece of Carbonum Plate Armor, or Notum Saturated Metaplast Armor.

The QLs do increase for all armor making except Dragon. Expect the QL of the final product to be about 1-3 QLs higher for hard armor, and 2-5 QLs higher for soft armor.

At this time, Notum Metaplast only comes in lowbie QLs. I am not sure what those QLs are, but I am fairly certain they do not go past QL75, or even if they go as high as QL75.

Mercatura @ 8/17/2002 6:16:00 PM (41476):
West and North (the 2 good ones, OF COURSE) are not dropping in 14.4, FC even confirmed it IIRC.

I'd love to play with West, great ma weapon, especially if the new inits formula I saw is correct. North has a hidden ma dual req of 1100 or so, which I bet a trader can do easily.

Right now blowing my next 50 odd levels mostly into tradeskills seems really boring and nearly pointless.

By the time you need albrecht its fairly cheap and common. Don't team with ninjas perhaps, drops every couple boss mobs.

48 hours isn't that long for many 

Putting on 200 albrecht or tank is a pain for all breeds except atrox, unless your implants are poorly laid out (stamina blocks things much more useful) or you enjoy swapping them all the time.

coldwarkid @ 8/18/2002 11:47:31 PM (45499):
AFAIK there's only one weapon which responds to hacking, the Mausser Particle Streamer. You hack one of these as part of the process to convert it to a Mausser Chemical Streamer.

Otherwise, hacking is used on pills, blister packs and grafts to reduce the requirements and remove any profession-specific restrictions. It can also be used on treatment clinics as part of the process to produce an Implant Disassembly Clinic (a fixer-only item).

In all cases the procedure is simple, you just use your Advanced Hacking Tool on the item to hack it. If you try this on an item and there's no effect (or no message telling you what B&E skill you need) then the item can't be hacked.

Cheers,

Will get updated directives/orders.

2 teams at the same time in a mission shouldnt be  a issue. indoor or outdoor.

Altough.. I posted this in tradeskill area.
Why?

Well think about it. Not all missions HAVE to involve illing something. Just avoding dying. or manaing to get all parts
in time and assemble them etc is tough enough in itself.

We allready see the NPC's and their quests. usually about collecting or assembling items.

Think of this as an idea that expands the current "boring" missions applies profession specific elements in whatever that profession is strongest in. (could be pure non-combat or full combat or similar).

A cross between "missions" and "quests". as we know them today

You will get an implant with 3 clusters.


I member the old days that it can make the cluster to change to QL2

So the main question is.

How I make sure that I get ql200 implant with all clusters in?
And How I make sure that I get ql200 implant just two clusters in?

thanks 

Just install the clusters. The resulting implant will be QL200.

Chestity makes it for clanners at 1k per piece per ql.  I think u saw the PPPE sell for 100mil, not a piece of armour.  The PPPE only comes at ql 60ish, which would suggest you saw that also.

I guess this is valid here too.

To make a chemical mausser you need to do the following things:-

buy a mausser particle streamer from shop at desired ql.
apply hacker tool

this results in hacked mausser base

apply compression chamber for chemicals
apply composite barrel
appy carbonum plate

end result chemical mausser.

Any room for a novice clan trader in this?

I've made a trader for doing items. (OK, NT is not the most damage dealing profession, but I wanted to do something else than just killing things.) My trader is currently lvl 29 (hopefully early 30ies by the end of tonight), but if I'm allowed to hang out with higher level trade-skillers, it would be great! I'd love to learn how to do things appart from rings and monster parts. And I find that learning from other players is better than just reading a manual. (I do read manuals! That's how I figured out how to make rings.)

Nicoashley @ 8/23/2002 4:25:57 PM (Drug Addict 46710):
Being a doctor most of my life on Rubi-Ka has given me a lot of insight as to what a real doctor should be like. One big thing I would like to see in the future is the expansion of the pharmatech skill. 

Aside from the health and nano stim, there should be different kind of stims that enhance your abilities for a short period of time and is used to enhanace combat. Some ideas of stims come to mind:

Rage Stim - a stim that greatly increase the target's damage output but lower his AC considerably, 30s

Painless Stim - heal twice the amount of a normal health stim but put a DOT on you 10s afterwards that last for 30s and damage is equal to the stim healed amount

Skin Hardening Stim - Increase the target's AC by a good amount by lower his damage output, 30s 

Init Stim - a stim that would increase your initiative by a moderate amount for 3min

Nasty Odour Stim - By injecting this stim the receptent's body is triggered to release a nasty odour that help to drive the mob away from the receptent :P (similar effect as the repressor)

Fake Death Stim - Self only. By injecting this stim you immediately enter a state of coma. You will drop dead on the ground for a minute then come back to life. A comparison of intelligence will be checked between you and the mob, if successful, the mob will ignore you, if not, the mob will keep attacking you and you will lay helplessly on the ground until the effect of the stim expired

Run Stim - just fix the damn thing and make it last longer!

Personally I'm against any stim that actually add to the abilities or skills as this will just give more ways for people to OE things (except for init which isnt used to equip anything). Different stim will have different recharge time (and preferably a % decrease in recharge for us doctors coz we're suppose to be good at these things :P). The stims will be makeable using the PharmaTech and Chemistry skill, and should be at a reasonable cost since they all have beneficts and drawbacks. They are meant to enhance the combat flow and add strategies to combat, not simply something superior to the normal stims.

As for treatment kit and rechargers please please please make them either available in shop or makeable. It is so annoying having to ask the team to save all the rechargers found in the mission for you consider you are not the only one that need them. As a doctor I could live with recharging every 2 mobs but what about a NT or any other nano intensive class? My NT have to charge once or even twice every mob, luckily the q125s is still good for her but I couldnt imagine what is it going to be like when she outgrown the 125s. Maybe thats why every high level nano user need a gun, not just for extra damage but also save them from insane recharging. 

A final note, make the same QL treatment kits and rechargers stackable! I'm sure this has drive many ppl nut >:O

You need about 1050 ME for virral egg combination.  It all depends on the gold ingots.  they have to be ql200+  which means 1000 ME.  Having 1050 ME means you should be able to do those up to ql210ish.

It's quite easy really. All aprts except the robot junk are provided in shops. 

Takes a lot of Electrical Engineering though (a lot, well to some it is -- ql200 brain is around 900 EE I recall 

A ql 200 brain will probably cost around 500-600k in parts from shops alone just fyi.. I don't remember the exact names of the parts atm., but they can be found in all tradeskill departments.

Good luck

Jica @ 8/24/2002 8:39:33 PM (45998):
Problem with those discs is that it's quite a lot of work.

I'm lvl 198 engineer with maxed tradeskills for my lvl. I need to do the following for making a ql 212 disc like Last Word from an exact ql 212 rock:


Get SFA buff from doctor.

Get ME, EE and QFT maestros from trader.

Get NP buff from MP (might be needed for only ql 215 discs, I forgot, but it's possible).

Go to store.

Buy symbol library, reflective pattern and photon particle emitter for the disc.

Change from my MKII armor to medsuit.

Prepare the disc in a PPPE (CL and NP).

Put in first row of implants for the cutting process (ME).

Put in second row of implants to insert the reflective pattern into the prepared carbonrich rock (EE and QFT).

Combine the PPPE with the rock with reflective pattern (EE and QFT again, if I'm not mistaken).

Change back to normal implants.

Put back on MKII armor.

-End-


That's quite a process to do. Not to mention that I know you can loose items like armor in crashes and to other bugs while swapping. Lost a pair of gloves myself that way (MKII) as to be of huge annoyment :/

I wont do this (unless payment is a nice amount or item) because it's a lot of hazzle and people who ask usually don't know how much work it really is to build high ql crystals.

Just a few pointers if anyone wonders why almost noone will make these. I could estimate an average price for doing this to be around 5 mil or more per disc.

Pepin @ 8/24/2002 8:44:41 PM (43474):

Well.. They might have thought it'd keep players in the game so much more haha.

I'm lvl 198 engineer and tired of xp-ing all the time. Been doing tradeskills mostly all day the past 2 months has made me about 5 mil xp only (except from getting extremely rich as well). I need 65 mil more to lvl! Would take me another 2 years most likely, but I could get them in 1 day doing missions.

I play because of the tradeskills mainly. Nothing is really wrong with them as they are. Of course it'd be nice with more xp per step at my lvl. But what I really would like is more additions to the tradeskill market; more stuff to build, make it a huge market of playermade items which are better than those found in all ways, and also add a subtext to each item made with a name of the crafter

Jica @ 8/24/2002 9:01:19 PM (44481):
Well chemistry is the primary skill required in creating Bronto Armor. I believe that the process also requires 500+ intelligence, but since I got 540ish unbuffed I didn't get that message. 

I don't think computer lit. is required at all for armor creation. Again, I got 940+ unbuffed so I probably meet req.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 9:04:49 PM (44481):
Just adding that for the Carbonum armor you need around 900 Chemistry as well for the etching process and 900 ME for the carving process. Also requires 500+ intelligence I believe.

Aggro trimmers requires chemistry as well as ME.

Sorry but that is incorrect.

Gold ingots has to be ql 190+, same as soul fragments, robot junk and egg (which defines the ql range).

Jica @ 8/24/2002 9:37:24 PM (43474):
For Dragon armor parts the Shape Soft Armor is required.

I've made a major amount of piece from both omnis and clans. Skill req. is rather low since they are ql 100 only.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 9:50:57 PM (45998):
Oh I can do them yes. Just listed the process and reason why many might not do them  

I'll do those if all buffs are supplied and a small fee is paid. Since I'm engineer I dont have access to maestros just like that and it's actually very hard to "just" get a trader to buff you. If I have to get buffs myself, I won't do a disc like that for less than 5 mil. 

I also believe that this is one of the hardest processes in tradeskills at all. Most expect that it's just something you "do" like that. It's actually a lot of work and I will charge accordingly. Once I get my self only tradeskill buffs in the future (;o) I will do it much cheaper

Jica @ 8/24/2002 9:56:01 PM (46431):

Quad @ 8/24/2002 10:02:33 PM (46431):
Oh you guys are so mean. Traders are the best at tradeskills because they get nanos that buff the tradeskills by 120. Thier base "tradeskills" will max out at the same value the engineer max's out at. Engineers have to hunt up a trader to get the buffs to make stuff.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:10:59 PM (45998):
I like to provide a good service. So to me it's better to get a few really satisfied customers and make a little less than it is to do a lot of rush jobs with perhaps semi satisfied players. 

I always take the time to either chat or answer questions if someone are buying something from me. I prefer quality above quantity and to be trustworthy and provide the best service possible.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:33:03 PM (46431):
Yes. No profession should be that self supplying as traders are. Tradeskills are about what engineers have for fun at higher lvls and we have only a few weak buffs for them. 

I would like just some self buff only (and maybe lvl req. buffs) tradeskill buffs for the engineer equal to the maestros. 

That way we wouldn't have to hunt down traders each time for buffs, and we couldn't buff others either, that'd still be the trader's job.

That way it wouldn't be an insane pain to make high ql discs or other high quality equipment.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:34:45 PM (46945):
Simply use a screwdriver on it.

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:40:44 PM (38920):
Well my MRRs (Shape Soft/Hard Armor) are both ql200. Only depends on the empty MRR unit you combine the ql60 PPPE with.

Not even I have sold armor for more than 55 mil a set. (I was first to hit the carbonum market and first prototype set went for 55 mil fyi. -- was a bid btw

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:48:41 PM (45489):
As a professional crafter I can say that the ACs clearly are best on Carbonum armor. Carbonum also adds NCUs which Bronto doesn't.

The ACs are about the same average, but Bronto armor provides a bit lower ACs than Carbonum. 

A benefit is that Bronto armor adds more nano pool than carbonum armor on some pieces (I believe).

Jica @ 8/24/2002 10:57:38 PM (46716):

Jica @ 8/24/2002 11:10:44 PM (42765):
I really believe in the self buff only idea.

Don't know if they should stack with maestros if they are equal to those, but if they stack maybe just add about 100 to tradeskills. 

Personally I would prefer some buffs that were self only and equal/a bit better than maestros but did not stack with the trader buffs.

But combining would make us best at tradeskills. Engineers are not really great at anything, and at high lvl the pet thing gets rather useless in all ways and people focus more on tradeskills. Yet we are so much lesser than traders in skills and mainly buffs.

Empty all the stuff out of it first, however.  Anything inside the backpack will be deleted when you convert it.

frakk2k @ 8/25/2002 4:49:37 AM (45489):
I had to check 

A tiny bronto vs Carboum check, this is the Chest Armor:

Bronto/Carbonum
chemical ac 1120/1200   
cold ac 1010/1000   
energy ac 610/500   
fire ac 1010/1000   
melee ac 1120/1200   
poison ac 1090/1000   
projectile ac 1010/1000   
radiation ac 610/500 

All in all : 7580/7400
(bronto gives max nano 200)
(carbonum:nano init 8/ncu memory 8/max nano 160)

Actually, bronto in overall have more ac  But placed at other places, like higher energy ac.

Ejeckted @ 8/25/2002 6:12:17 AM (46405):
thanks Chestity,

I've already had a fair bit of bronto armor made by you,
but they were QL200 patches to begin with.
(+ some lower bit for alts & I didnt pay much attention to scaling)

Is there any solid way to predict the final QL?

depending how OE is calculated (if they round up or not),
I think I may need some slightly lower than QL200.

Jica @ 8/25/2002 12:06:46 PM (46405):
There are two processes when making Bronto armor: Tanning and carving.

After making over 300+ pieces of that kind of armor I've noticed that in general (not sure about the really low ql patches yet) the ql increases +3 per step. So ql 194 should be ql200. 

I can double check this. Noone actually asked about this before, to be honest

Good reminder. Forgot that one

Jica @ 8/25/2002 12:12:30 PM (45489):
Well most would pick Carbonum because it also adds NCUs. 

Bronto adds more nano pool but it's not a significant more. Some may also wear Bronto for looks (like I do at times

I would like to see a self only tradeskill buff for engis.  I always thought it was odd that traders could wrangle and their skills would lower but when doing trade skill buffs they don't lose anything.  Only reason why I could think that funcom didn't setup trade skill buffs like wrangles is because then there would be no reason for a trader to get the high lvl ones.

Traders just wouldn't make enough back for the effort from the times that they would use the nanos for buffing engis.

I am not sure what would be the best way to handle the buff, having a programs that add to all tradeskills and is self only.  Have 3 of them with level requirements like 50,100, 150 or something like that.

Intrepid @ 8/25/2002 3:09:05 PM (46945):

well your problem was you did ql60 missoins.  Usually the boss loot at that level is about 8 levels higher then the mission so you were trying to get ql60 loot by rolling ql68 missions.  Doesn't happen very often  your better of trying missions in the 50s if you are trying to find PPPEs.

Great suggestion, but why did u put it on the trade skill forum???

Shatai @ 8/26/2002 2:26:33 AM (46206):
Requirements to wear
Treatment required = (4.72 * QL of the implant) + 5.28
Round-up, and you'll be there.  A point or two short at most.

Stat required = (2 * QL of the implant) + 4
This is exact.

Requirements to make
You'll need the following:-

1) Implant of the desired QL
2) The desired clusters
3) Nano programming skill

For the clusters, the QL of the clusters can be below the QL of the implant, about 15% below.  If you want to check, buy an implant, get QL 1 (or really low) Shining, Bright and Faded clusters that will fit in that implant, and try to combine them.  I'm not sure if the requirements are different for Shining/Bright/Faded, but generally, 15% below the QL of the implant is about as low as you can go for the clusters.

For skill, you'll need at most a skill level equal to 5 times the QL of the implant.  I say at most for a couple of reasons.  Firstly, different clusters need different levels of skill.  The most demanding are max life/nano clusters, which require a skill of 5*QL.  Secondly, if you install a cluster above the implant's QL, you can raise the QL of the implant slightly, but the skill required to make it will default to that of the implant's QL.  So, if you're making QL 50 implants, a fully buffed NP skill of 250 will be enough.  Be aware, though, that it is possible to raise the QL through a very high NP skill, and that the requirements to actually equip the implant will be based on the final QL.  So if you plan for a particular QL and raise it while making it, you may not be able to wear the final implant.

Nano Nanny
A very useful tool.  Lets you plan out your implants so that you don't waste time and money experimenting.  Will also give you treatment required to implant, which stat and how much of that stat is required to implant, the NP skill required to make, and also what bonuses the implants will give you.  You can select a series of skills and have it auto-assign clusters for you, to save some time.  Whole host of things it can do.

You can download it here.  Full credit to The Mockers, where I got that link from.

I think that's about everything.  If you have any more questions, just ask.

I agree on the level requirement part first of all. Second of all, I'm actually having trouble finding high lvl traders willing to buff me maestros these days. They are all hiding (hehe), which makes it so much harder to get skills high and a pain to do the advanced ones, because you know you face 1 hour+ of buffhunting.

Neph @ 8/26/2002 3:24:34 PM (42765):
Maybe we could have our own upgradable item like agents (Balaclava) and fixers (NCU Hacked Interface) recently got.

A special 'Gloves of Enhanced Skills' or 'Forge of Perfect Smithing' that would add to most (all) tradeskills. +1 at ql1, +150 at ql200 (no idea what would be a reasonable high-end value). And it could be upgraded at every level.

Of course, it should not be a tarasque drop or boss loot only!
Could be built using existing tradeskill items at different qls. So if you are higher lvl, you can directly built a higher ql one using the correct parts.

Wombat17 @ 8/26/2002 3:34:35 PM (46206):
I know that if the quality of the NC is higher than the empty implant, when combined, NC quality will drop so the final implant will be equal to that of the original, empty implant.  However, what happens if the quality of the NC is -lower- than that of the target implant? Will they combine and if so what will the quality of the final implant be?

Also, what determines the secondary skill required to equip the implant? Is it the highest nano cluster in the implant or is it the last implant inserted?   

Thanks for all the information, it's much appreciated =)

Thanks for posting that list of what is involved in making a high ql nano for an engineer.  I am 181 and I have the same list, with some slight additons for swapping out different pistols and clothing  for additional QFT, ME, or whatever.  It is a major hassle and I hope that everyone reads this.  5 mil is a very fair price for the trouble involved.  (Actually after I did this the first time, I decided it couldn't be worth less than 1 mil per ql of the nano, it was so difficult to do.  But I have since regained my sanity.  )

Devis @ 8/26/2002 9:42:44 PM (45051):

If you install an NC of higher quality than the implant, the NC will drop, yes, but it's likely that the QL of the implant will raise slightly.  No more than 1 QL per NC, from what I've seen, but it's there.  You can also raise the QL of the final implant just from having a high level of NP skill.

If you try to install a lower quality NC, then whether or not it will combine depends on just how low the NC is.  If you want to find out exactly how low you can go, get a really low level cluster (sub-level 10) that will fit into the implant, and try to install it.  It'll tell you how high the cluster needs to be.  If you install a cluster above that level, but below the implant's level, then yes, they will combine.  The quality of the final implant will be the quality of the original basic implant.  Again, if you have a really high level of skill, it might even be a point higher.

That, I'm not sure.  It's the combination, I believe, but how it works I don't know.  Nano Nanny will tell you, or Auno's antiguardians site has an implant designer available, under the "Tools" link.

locomdenom @ 8/27/2002 1:19:46 AM (46206):
For the record, the disassembler sold in the fixer store is not fully functional... as is.

You need to tradeskill it into a finished Implant Disassembly Clinic.  Then it works.

Reqs to make are, IIRC, EE and CL.

Reqs to use are: high B&E (4.75*QL of implant), ?fixer? (not sure about that part)

Pays007 here on RK-1, 

For undisclosed reasons im trying to get my last thread burried/deleted so please do not bump it.  THIS thread will be my new home now.  

*Edit*  Sept 19th

-Updated mech eng a point or two
-Added a question



As for my skills, I can make just about anything now except that ql239 disc ^_^


Including...

ql215 Nano crystals 
ql200 Hard armor (Carbonum/CAS/Barter) 
ql200 Soft armor (Bronto/Dragon/Metallic Mantis)
ql200 Recepticles
ql200 Robotic Brains
ql200 Trimmers
ql200 Enhanced aggression enhancers
ql200 Adv shields
ql220 Implants 
ql200 Implant Disassembly
ql200 Treatment clinics 
ql200 Disassembly clinics 
ql200 Emergency treatment kits 
ql200 Hp/Nano restoration stims (the bodydev/swimming versions too) 
ql200 Weapons of every kind 
Virral Eggs 
Bow Ties
Overtuned tank armor 
Coffee Machines
etc, etc, etc. 

And since im a trader I also do all the tradeskill buffs for things like LLTSs as well as every wrangle under the Rubi-Ka Suns  

If it needs to be made i can do it. If they had a kitchen sink I could probably make that too.  

Best of all is that i do all this solo, no outside help (other then disassembling ql190+ implants) which means you NEVER have to wait for me to run around and get buffs. You simply come to me, wait in line if there are other people, and i do it for you right there on the spot. 

Location: I am at the East gate in omni trade alot. However I am currently searching for a new locations because FC has doubled the # of guards at the E gate which I used to divest.





PRICES (The best part so far....) 

I have no set prices. I belive that is too rigid as I know it is better to be flexible. 

For lower ql stuff: Tips** and a "Thanks" is all i ask for  
For medium ql stuff: Tips** and a "Thanks" again. Although since it is harder to make and more valuable i am probably going to expect a little more compensation for my efforts. 
For High ql stuff: Depending on what it is, how much there is, and how hard it is to do we will come to an agreement before i make it. It will almost always be lower then the average going rate

Naturally, bulk orders are given a discount, as well as repeat customers. 

I also accept items sometimes depending on what I need. 
Currently looking for:
-High Level Platinum
-Notum Nuggets/Chips/Shards
-Peices to Virral Eggs


** Like others have pointed out. When we tradeskill people say tips, that does not mean 1k for a 132 wrangle or 100k for an entire set of ql200 implants is acceptable. Please try and remember of the effort/time it takes and the time/ip you have saved by getting someone else to do it for you. 





Couple Last "Rules" or "Requests" that i ask.. 

1. DO NOT Send me /tells asking for wrangles. (other things are ok) Come to the east gate in Omni-trade and talk to me. I get too many people asking me for wrangles when im trying to have fun with friends in a mission and I don't want more then i have already.

2. If it says I am AFK or i don't answer you right away, please wait or try again later. I am probably busy and will get back to you when I can. If you constantly harass me with /tells i will probably just /ignore you. 





Well thats it. Thankyou for reading, hope to serve you soon ^_^ 

Remember, I work at the EAST gate in Omni-trade (the HQ one)

Questions
Answers to questions i get all the time i will post here...Real questions asked by real in game people

Q. Can I trust you?
A. Y-E-S.  I am not going to rip you off, or screw you over. I  have never done so and would not even think about it.

Q. Will you go shopping for the parts for me?
A. No. You have to bring all the peices for me to make it out of (I have the tools).  I am not going to waste my time running in shop circles looking for spare parts for people.

Q. When are you on?
A.  I am on lots, but most likely during the afternoon/evening. (little later in the afternoon/evenings for Europe).

Q. Are you there?
A. If i am at the east gate, but have not said hello or hit you with my "busy" macro... then i am most likely AFK. Please wait or try again later.

Q.  Do you do clan?
A. Yes, but if you are unable to come to me (I sit between two omni guards that i use to divest) you must wait for me to finish all the omni customers i may have at the time.  If you can not wait, try giving a tell to Superslang.  He spends even more time then I do doing tradeskills and works in Tir. However I am currently searching for a new location to serve both clan and omni.

Q. Do you make xxxxxxxx's ?
A. I make E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.  Except ql 239 discs


Q. What parts do I need for xxxxxxxxx ?
A. I spend about 50% of my time trying to explain to people what they need which decreases my performance and efficiency. Please check out the following sites for info on what parts you need and what can actually be made with tradeskills: http://www.anarchyarcanum.com/ , http://virral.clansupport.com/ , and http://ao.altgame.com/TheForge/ ..................remember, I DO have the TOOLs needed...




For future reference, or for when new things are added. I can get my tradeskills up to the following... 

ME: 1054 - (1117) 
EE: 1080 - (1122) 
QFT: 1005 - (1107) 
WS: 1091 
Pharm: 998 - (1100) 
NP: 1084 - (1186) 
PSY: 932 - (974) 
Chem: 876 - (979) 
B&E: 904 
Comp lit: 1300+ 
(bracet) numbers are my maxs if i have +80 treatment. Those number are self buffed as well... if you can bring an outside buff (a fixer b&e buff for instance) you can add that to my total.

however last nite i hacked a QL 135 summer FA SMP sealed weapon receptacle and did not know what to do with it so i went to the basic shop to try my way thru all the items in rngd wpn shop, thinking i would not b able to join a ql 10-20 item with my unfinished gun :/ .....boy was i wrong. 
now im the proud owner of a ql,6 summer FA SMP (quite a nice fixer gun). 
to prevent this from happening again id like to know if any1 out there nkows the recepies for completing theese guns?. 


btw to make the SUMMER FA SMP u'll need a : SEALED WEAPON RECEPTACLE-SUMMER FA SMP 
hack it! 
now u got a UNFINISHED SUMMER FA SMP 
go buy a GYRO STABILIZING UNIT of about the same ql as the unfinished gun in rngd wpn shop, and merge the 2 items. 
now u have a SUMMER FA SMP , hopefully higher than ql,6 

i have a theory that u can merge it with other items than a gyro... 
with the gyro the reqs are : heavy wpns 
SMG 
fling-shot 

hope some1 can help me

Yes, they go on the back which by the time you can afford it/use it, there are ten million better things to be wearing.....Although....for a fixer using GA this may work as I don't think it's actually classified as armor

coltross @ 8/27/2002 10:08:26 PM (46710):
The whole stim things is a great idea. This would give doctors another reason to be loved by one and all, as well as adding a new dimension to the strategy of play. As you said, each thing has a drawback so it would be a use at your own risk kinda deal.

CryptoNut @ 8/28/2002 1:15:05 AM (Has anyone figured out how to construct bows yet? 47676):
It seems logical that one should be able to make these given the presence of Bow Constriuction Kits.  However, I've attempted to combine things with the kit but to no avail.  Granted, I have not yet experimented thouroughly but I thought I might save myself a migraine... I'm hoping someone else has already tried every permutation.  I'm further hoping that someone has had some success.  

Anyone?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Brilliant.

Speaking as a pharmacist myself, I'd love to be able to make these things.

The only think I'd add is that FC introduce the nano knots at a reasonable price, so it wouldn't cost 500k to make 100 ql100 stims.  

And if I could make nano rechargers I'd be a very rich man.

Take some robot junk, use the screwdriver on it to get a nano sensor.

Then go to the tradeskill shop to buy.....damn forgot the name, wanna say the bio-analyzing console and Personallized Comm device (forgive, for I cannot remember the names, will edit later).

Combine the Bio device with the nano sensor and then the resulting item combine with the Personallized Comm.  Voila a personalized robot brain.

This skill requires Elec Engie and a qlvl 165 robot junk will yield a brain that gives about +13 to sense, but needs 700+ complit to equip.  

If you want a smaller one, go at least qlvl 75 robot junk, gives +5 to sense.

I've got a QL28 Personalized Robot Brain that someone made for me a long time ago. Adds +5 Sense, making it a little easier to get in those irritating Sense-based implants. I'd been wanting to get a better one made, but it seems like it probably isn't that big a deal. If a QL200 one requires 961 Comp Lit and only adds +15 Sense, I probably wouldn't get much with my current max 420 Comp Lit, probably only a +7 or so, tops.

But thanks for the pointer to Anarchy Arcanum. I'd been looking for these instructions for a long time.

Hierodule @ 8/30/2002 10:54:38 AM (Notum Chips, Fragments, and Nuggets 48248):
Yes, that's right, it's the new snack food that all Rubi-Ka craves!

No, seriously. 

Everbody finds these things -- Notum Fragments, Notum Chips, and Enriched Notum Nuggets. Nobody knows what they're for. They can't be cut like other gemstones. They have no tradeskill uses that I've been able to find. Are they just minor moneymakers?

It seems like they should have a use, since notum is the most valuable thing on Rubi-Ka. The description of the nugget even says "To be used in manufacturing of nano-bots."

Maybe it's a tradeskill that hasn't been implemented yet?

Kzak @ 8/30/2002 10:58:56 AM (48248):
The notum fragments/chips/nuggets have no known use to this day.. I've tried combining them with some items I thought might yield results myself, but no luck.

I think that -someday- they will be useful, but presently? Nope.

Perhaps they'll be part of the process to make notum-saturated metaplast armor or something, who knows?

Kzak @ 8/30/2002 11:02:26 AM (47838):

I need to find someone who can make me a full set of QL 165-170 Implants. I have only one character-a lev 145 MA Opifex-Clan.
I'm still wearing the set of QL112's I purchased from a high level MA  back when I was level 62 or so.
I need someone to obtain all the Basic Implants (Augmentations) and Purchase the Clusters ( I will provide a list of Clusters )and put them together. I am willing to pay a Reasonable price -over the cost of all the Items- for this effort. I have advertised on the ingame Shopping Channel and on the Rubi-Ka 1 Exchange a number of times without any responses. If nobody here can/will do this maybe you could give me some advice on how I might best go about getting my Implants done.  Thanks.

coldwarkid @ 8/30/2002 1:10:20 PM (47856):
To clarify shyone's statement somewhat:

To make a completed crystal you need to get your hands on some carbonrich rock of an appropriate level (http://www.virral.com for more details on where to find the stuff) and use a Jensen Personal Ore Extractor, and Isotope Separator and a Neutron Displacer to refine the rock into a crystal. These steps require Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering and Quantum Field Theory, which is where you're likely to come unstuck.

However, the actual programming side should be a snap, since that requires Nano Programming (big surprise) which is obviously a green skill for NT's, and Comp. Lit. Probably your best way forward would be to team up with an Engineer and split the process, the engi can do the engineering steps and you can do the programming portions. If you're very high level a Trader would be a good bet, although my experience at lower levels has been that many Traders don't put IP into tradeskills.

Cheers,

That is good news indeed. I am not normally ingame after 5Pm CDST but will make a special effort to be in tonight-but I cannot be ingame after 7PM CDST due to Commitments elsewhere.
I will be ingame this weekend for sure so if we happen to miss tonight then perhaps tomorrow. I usually begin around 6AM and am in and out until 5PM CDST. I am confused enough with just what Clusters I need/want as an MA --so many and varied suggestions from other MA's so I d/l the program called "Nano-Nanny" --perhaps this will help me decide on a good selection.
Working on it now. Many thanks.

Gollun @ 8/30/2002 10:08:50 PM (Armor and Tradeskills 48375):
I want to make armor in AO!! By the trade shops its obvious that weapon smithing was given (some) attention since we can make at least 2 or 3 kinds of weapon in each class (but I´ve been told that some recepies are broken too) and in the armor shop we only got 2 itens!!!!!!!!
  I am missing something here? Or is that the sad truth........?
  I´ve heard you can make some armor at high lvl (carbon and bronto stuff) but how about regular armor.........I personally hate to be wearing 3 sets of armor at once...........its VERY ugly! People care about looks (thats why those sunglasses are way too expensive) and its funcional too! Its realistic to have like a bonus AC when you got a full set of armor on you too! After all I dont believe metaplast dorso was made to fit cyber helmet. The tradeskill people would have a true demand of itens to craft.............right now I feel disapointed to spend IP on skills I rarely use........... 
 LOOK the eng guimp!!
  I have np with some random factor in shops but I think this game have taken this concept a little too far! SPECIALLY if player cant do armor!
 When I first logged I thought that the reason shops were random was to stimulate ppl to buy from players.....thats make sense (maybe they have planned it but were unable to implement?)
 Last thing  - I think its cool have a such complex way to assemble an item (specially weapons) 12 steps! WOW....but if this complexity is getting in the way of implementing a full tradeskill community than PLEASE simplify it! Maybe 5 steps and include a ton of new itens!!!!!!! Rise the price of components make necessary to travel or trade for them (even quest for it) but plz dont make it random (I guess I know why the game is called Abarchy Online now! )
  When you go to a (real) shop most of the itens you want are there, the few rare/uncommon ones you order them! Why not make a similar system (you pay extra, do a mission........whatever!) How I can assure a player I will deliver him the goods if I cant even find basic materials!!!
   Is that so diff from a programer point of view to make a Player shop? Let me put my item there and if another player buys it I get the credits (some % might be lost in the shop).
          Well, most of this might have been discussed in the past, but since I am new to the game, forgive me..............

I bought the parts for a ql 65 one, and I think I spent something like 100k for the parts. Will the finishing result be worth it? How much are ordinary treatment kits that heal about 1400 hp sold for in the store? (Forgot to check this in shop.)

Kirikiri

Mercatura @ 9/1/2002 6:52:09 PM (48720):
Store ones stop at healing 946 or so life for ql125. Tradeskill ones are worth making if you go out and find the people who want them. I'd advise a made-to-order model over just making random kits.

Ql120-150 would probably be the best selling, your typical buyer with plenty of cash to blow would likely be a level 120-199 doing the usual 500,000 BS missions looking for a nice set to use in the boss room or when the healing is lacking.

TerorRaen @ 9/1/2002 8:54:49 PM (48214):
I thought the question was WHERE did you get the PPPE.. as in.. what location was the mission TO.

Good to know the mission doesnt have to be exactly level 60, as others have gottten them in level 55-60 missions.... I am curious as to location myself, though only one person has mentioned the location thus far.

Thanks

Lovio @ 9/1/2002 9:18:04 PM (Tradeskills for a lower level trader? 48754):
Just recently started a trader alt, and I've always liked trade-skills in general. What skills should I invest in at these levels? I can't go much higher than 3 skills, since IP is really tight at the first few levels afterall. 

What skills will I be able to make a bit of good money of, and how? What do I do?

Gattolina @ 9/1/2002 10:26:50 PM (48754):
Being a lvl 51 trader, I don't have that much experience. But I've focused my trade skills on mechanical engineering and pharmatec. I like to make jewellery, and I can always find rings, gems, bracer and bracelets to keep me doing it. As for pharmatec, it gives you the oppertunity to convert monster parts to blood plasma, and then to emergency treatment kits if you want to. (Not too sure if this is worth the money or not. See other thread.)

I haven't bothered to work on weapon smithing and nano crystals yet. Don't know if I'll do either, as I haven't given much though or IP to it yet. And there are allway someone better at nano programming for implants, so I think I won't bother about that either. But converting gems for rings is fun!

coldwarkid @ 9/2/2002 12:09:32 AM (48754):
Weaponsmithing is likely to prove frustrating and unprofitable in the long term, although it's fun to make yourself a gun sometimes, just because you can. The pitfalls are the unreliability of the process and the fact that the database has moved on a little since the weapon construction manuals were implemented. You can usually buy something better than you can build, in other words.

Popular tradeskills are nanoprogramming and jewellery making (not sure if blood plasma really counts in this context). Yes, there are better nano programmers out there, but it's incredibly handy to be able to make your own implants when you outgrow the pre-builts, so you might want to keep this skill high in any case. 

Jewellery making is really just another cash enhancer, but it's a much more involved cash process than converting monster parts. It just feels more like a proper tradeskill, which is largely what it's all about for me. However, since it represents such an easy source of cash for the first few levels I'd recommend dropping a few IP into pharma tech anyway and getting yourself a bio comminutor - never mind whether it's a "proper" tradeskill or not, it's useful.

Cheers,

Hurtig @ 9/2/2002 1:02:27 AM (Implants, clusters and base ability reqs... 48792):
Hi all!

I don't know if this thread belongs here ... anyway - here goes.

Implants have two requirements. 
One is treatment which is dictated by the ql of the implant and I belive, the location of the implant (correct me if I'm wrong here).
The other is one of 6 base abilities (Str, Agi, Sta etc.) which seems to be dictated by the best (shining, bright, faded) cluster in the implant or does it ?

A head implant with a shining Treatment cluster and nothing else, has agility as it's requirement.

A head implant with a shining Treatment, bright Map Navigation and a faded Perception cluster has intelligence as it's requirement ?

Being an agent I would prefer all agility implant, but how do I know what clusters to use to get implants with agility requirements ?

Does anybody have a list or know a website with info on implants and their ability requirements ?

Mercatura @ 9/2/2002 1:12:38 AM (48792):
I'll save my fingers a little and point you here. Its 99% accurate.

Ability req == (QL * 2) + 4

Treat req ~= QL * 4.8

If you have an empty implant, QL * 5 = final treat req is safe way to estimate the gain in QLs from having 3 clusters installed.

The new implants in 14.5 database are a lot different, I think a 200 nano doc would be lucky to get 230s in using head/eye/hand and every trick in the book.

Mercatura @ 9/2/2002 1:26:50 AM (48754):
Tradeskills before title4 cap are a hard drain on IP. Wouldn't suggest it. If you're tight for money missions are what you need.

Trader NP is still 5 per level, same as NT/Engy/MP. With ASM you're as good as the MP  I just started this now, you can get just over 1000 NP without implant swapping at title5 cap, with ASM and 1k board of course  Plenty of demand for that.

3 tradeskills, even pure green ones, sounds like you're really hurting yourself somewhere else. I didn't see enough spare IP to keep a tradeskill maxed until 130, even then I spent it in things more useful to me at the time like MC/Runspeed/Duck/etc.

161+ looks great for tradeskills though. 80k IP/level with pretty much everything already maxed. You can do the whole damn tradeskills tab if you want

Kzak @ 9/2/2002 8:28:09 AM (48352):
The bracelets themselves can't be constructed, as Arul Saba isn't in the game, and you need vital parts from him to complete the bracelets.

But the guide can be found at: Virral.clansupport.com. Look it up, read to your heart's content. 

(I, like most other tradeskillers, hope Arul Saba will appear in 14.5 or 14.6.)

Octo @ 9/2/2002 9:49:51 AM (41301):
Imagine in a month or two, how drastically your post count would drop if this thread would be deleted. =)

Still cant do the 239 anima huh? ;P I always thought of it as impossible, but evidently its possible at lvl 199-200. Tarage (trader) built it, and in the process had to refresh +80 three times or so. Cant remember... it takes a long time. Hope Funcom doesn't add any new nanos that are higher than 212.

Question I have for you however is: How are your combat skills? With the investments into pharmacy, chemistry and B&E, I can't really see that you can be using several types of weapons and MA? Simply MA maybe? According to the posts you have made, you seem gimped combatwise... But which engineer isn't? =)

Anarchin @ 9/2/2002 10:52:40 AM (Tutoring 48856):
Does anyone have some guidelines on how to use tutoring devices? And the tutoring skill in general?

Maximilian @ 9/2/2002 12:19:05 PM (48856):
that is rather simple (today).

Just get a tutoring device of the desired trade skill (loot), ensure that your tutoring skill (green to everybody) is high enough, target yourself, and (shift) right click on it.

Now your (trade) skill is enhanced for up to 50 points (ql200/1000 tutoring; linear progression) for a short period of time (2 min?)

Dunno how long it locks tutoring?

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.S. Somewhere I do know your face from?

It locks it for 3 minutes, and you can only use the buff for 2 mins... annoying...

the buffs it gives u is: 
[required skill in tutoring] / 20 = [points buffed]

This device is very nice when making nanocrystals, since this device can fill out the faded spot in some implants set. This device also helps me to fit into QL200 NCU at lvl125 with only QL125 imps... don't have the 1k token board though, but complit maxed...

Sorry to say so, but below ql 190 the only ones you can sell them to are the shop terminals (NPCs). Maybe an engineer or other ring making profession might want to buy it, but chances are rather low.

Best price you will get at an (omni) trader shop, so in case you know a (omni) trader you can trust  fill a bag with the stuff you want to sell and let him/her do the job and get the money for it.

Pays007 @ 9/3/2002 8:08:50 PM (47484):
How to make armor

1. Find or buy the rare PPPE Soft/Hard 
2. Combine that with a Mass Relocating Robot (ql180+) to make a MRR (Shape hard/soft armor)
3.  Raise your mech eng and chemistry to 900+

For Carbonum (probably that NT metaplast armor too when it comes out)
-Get a sheet of carbonum
-Use an etch-a-sketch thingy on the sheet (on for each peice)
-Use the Hard MRR on the etched peice

For Dragon Armor
-Some how get your hands on some dragon parts
-Use the soft MRR on the peice

For Bronto Armor
-Use some tanning acid on the parts
-Use the soft MRR on the tanned parts.

coldwarkid @ 9/3/2002 8:55:14 PM (42765):
Someone (or more likely several someones) came up with the idea of helperbots a while ago. The easy way to implement these would be as a nano that drops a time-limited item into your inventory that can then be equipped to boost tradeskills. Make a nice little wireframe for it similar to the wen-wen that floats over the user's shoulder and voila - instant helperbot. Use MC/TS for the initial nano and you get around the PM/SI problem.

Cheers,

On the one hand I'm tempted to agree with you, but if these buff did need Sens Imp and Psy Mod it would give Engineers another reason to raise those skills.

On the other hand however why would the new buffs need to use those 2 skills.

Myself, I'm more for these buff coming in the form of Engineer-only gadgets (the helper or 'buffy' bot is a good idea) rather than nanos. These gadgets however should be easily obtainable or beter yet buildable and not require stupid skills (Giraldi crystal anyone) or rediculously hard to obtain parts.

Boinky @ 9/4/2002 2:29:58 PM (42765):
Why didn't FC give us Engis Tradeskill buffs from the start anyway? Are we not designed for tradeskill mastery, and yet the skills are expensive and we have to beg buffs from Traders to have any ip left over for anything else to do much?

Its easier to blitz the mission for the QL239 nano than to make it.  I've got a few on me I've blitzed.  It just isnt worth building.

To the question: I also have a QL184 Krutt on me for the bonus in trade skills.  Super crits.  Like firing a cannon.  Kinda slow but with a +114 ranged init buff I cast on myself it helps.

When Warlock brought up the engineers' plight in a Community thread, Cz stated that further Engineer posts would be deleted.

Combined with the lack of response on the Engineer forums, I see several of my fellow engis losing hope. It's not easy to keep hope up for myself either.

So, why are we still here? 

Probably hoping against hope that something will be done. Or playing against the odds and trying to overcome the many deficiencies this profession has.

Give me a yell in game.  I'll make them up for free (QL179 and lower) if you bring the rocks to match em.

Matching them:  You have a Disc QL 140 - Bring a rock QL139-179. (When I make the rock into a crystal it raises the QL lvl a bit)

If they are above 179 I'll need buffs - Depending on who I get them from it may cost.

Catch me on saturday.

When hacking parts for treatment libraries we are all by now are familiar with the idea tha the hacking tool is lost. This is an unreasonable side effect, one that I would hope is intended to be fixed. Would our tradeskill developers out there in FunComland care to comment on this and let us know if this is planed to be repaired or just left like all the other game bugs that become features?

HSR Armor pattern + carbonium (both from shop) = etched carbunium or something like that

etched carbonium + hard shaped armor MRR = carbonium armor part (depending on type of armor pattern)

the tricky part is to find the robot intruction disc hard shaped armor for the mass relocation robot - it's ultra rare and is traded (if ever) for millions of credits.

When I tried to use my 200 tool on my spare 200 implants, I only had 150 EE or so.

He was probably thinking of making treatment libraries, which I think takes 800 EE and 850 B&E, though my 196 turned into a 200 when the guy was done with it.

Ahh good old EE, reset it with IPR, going to max it again in a few levels

Mercatura @ 9/9/2002 9:01:15 PM (50434):
If you're really into making and using your own weapons, try chem maussers.

You can build a regular one, then hack and convert it.

I don't know if the mausser process is broken or not though. Safe bet would be that it is, last I bothered to look most didn't work.

The tradeskills section in shops has everything you need: the guides, the kits, and the parts.

coldwarkid @ 9/10/2002 12:59:05 AM (50434):
This thread has a reasonably complete listing of what works and what doesn't. The good news is that most of the recipes are not broken. The bad news is that the entire 1H-edged category is fubared.

Weapon contruction is still a bit hit and miss, even with kits that are confirmed as working. Most of the time you're fine, but sometimes a kit just doesn't like the combination of QL's that have gone into it and refuses to accept the next part. However, the biggest problem with the whole enterprise is that there really isn't much that you can build which is as good as the stuff you'll find in missions, or even in the shops.

That said, every other construction process in the game appears to be working absolutely correctly. I've never heard of a problem with implants, nanocrystals, chem Mausser conversions, jewellery etc. It's only weapon manuals and kits which have problems, so don't let the problems in this area put you off the idea of tradeskills entirely. Tradeskills are something I personally find very satisfying, and I take every opportunity to make something new when the opportunity arises.

Cheers,

I filled a backpack and my inventory with the Carbonrich Rocks I found scattered all over.  Then, not knowing where I was, I ran headlong into the near by town and got riddled by the very efficient Omni-Tek guards!  Ok, so I knew that would happen but I wanted to get back home!  I figured there was a Grid Entrance in the town or I'd get killed and be reconfigured back in Old Athens.  Sooner than you could blink I was staring at the familiar face of a Reclaim Terminal.

But I got my Rocks!!!!!!

Berkut @ 9/10/2002 5:42:58 PM (Does Funcom consider tradeskills to be working as intended? 50672):
I am curious as to whether FC considers tradeskills to be pretty much what they want, or whether they think they are horribly broken.

Coming from DAOC, the AO tradeskill model is horrible. In DAOC, tradeskills have their own set of problems, but there is a real economy around them. After the very beginner levels, there is no real reason to buy stuff from merchants anymore. Everything you need is better and cheaper from a player, if not from a quest.

In AO, my first character is now level 40 (I know, I am still a total newb) and other than getting help with implant assembly, which isn't really a tradeskill anyway, I have had no need to buy *anything* that any player creates.

It seems like maybe at the very high end there is more, but that means that you ahve to get a tradeskill character up into the high end before he can start making any money to fund his tradeskilling.

Am I missing something here? Is this just the way it is in AO?

Crystal Sphere
Ember
Ember Sphere

Soul Fragment
Spring Crystal

Some rings:-

Snake Ring
Toe Ring

Other sources of metal (can substitute for rings):-
Golden Nugget
Silver Nugget
Golden Bracer
Bracelet of Ka
Bracer of Reflection (any type)
Bracer of Shielding (any type)

You'd have to melt Bracers of Reflection/Shielding down yourself.  You might have better bracers that you could use (especially after 14.5, when Bracers of Reflection reflect a lot less), and this allows you to actually get something for them.

Hope this helps.

I know that they CAN make Ql.125 if they can make Ql.200.  But for example some people are charging 18 Mil per implant.  They stated that they will make Ql. near that if needed.  I don't want to pay 18 Mil for implants taht I could make myself for under 3 Mil and I was thinking they probably don't want to waste their time with QL.125.

actually, the problem is the ql of the MMR . The Robot Ins Disc qls are as follows:

ql 10 Improving Crushing Weapons
ql 20 Improving Thrusting ...
ql 30 Improving Slashing ...

So long as you don't combine these with lower ql symbol libraries and PPEs you should be ok.... you need ql40 MMR to modify weapons at 200ql

i mean really, the discs are such low ql there's no reason to buy lower ql parts than that...

I have a ql disc if anyone needs

Strycker @ 9/11/2002 8:10:13 PM (50689):
Don't be silly.

No one charges 18M to make an implant, or even a full set. 

Personally I accept donations for nanoprogramming which tend to be around the 100k to 200k per implant level at QL 200, though of course I have gotten more occasionally from high level players and twinks. In general I accept any amount for implant building for just one or two or a few at a time, and give back any attempted donations from low level players who can't possibly offer me any worthwhile amount of money. Of course I am not always available to make full sets of implants, since it is a pain to do all that clicking and trading, but I am almost always available to make a few when I am around town.

When I was low level, unguilded, and without my 1k token board, I never had any trouble finding nanoprogrammers who would build implants for what I could afford, or even for free at times.

There may be fewer players now, but there still seem to be plenty of NPs around, since token boards are now so easy to get. I would say that about half the time I am logged in I see people advertising high level NP skill on the shopping forum.

Oh, and by the way Orikx, no NP is going to go shopping for your clusters. That's your job. It should take you a good 30 minutes to find a full set of QL 125+ clusters in the various superior shops in trade and ent. You should also have all the implants and clusters fully sorted, offering them one at a time for construction. No one likes to play a massive game of concentration on some set of backpacks randomly stuffed with clusters and implants.

This is a good idea for those trying to get into it.  Get your maestroes on and cut the rocks up into the empty program crystal.  It doesnt require in most instances LESS QFT to combine the last piece (programmed space/psi/med/etc crystal) before the final combination to maket the nano itself.

I cut up 2 bags last night and made a whole pack of nanos.

FYI: You might not want to sell your discs to the store but hold onto them and build them!  They sell for 10X as much once they are built.  My trader was selling a nano: superior lick wounds for 150K or so.  The disc wasnt worth 30K.  Cost of making the nano 2K or so.   So..don't sell them in the stores until built.

I'm not sure if this is the best place to ask, but Monster parts was mentioned so I figured I'd ask.  I've started an Engi(Traylok-lvl 22) and the other day I was asked if I convert Robot junk(I think..maybe was monster parts).  What I was wondering is what do you get from converting eithor of them and is this something that I could put some extra IP point to to make some extra cash?

I don't mean to change the subject, but being a Master Maker, I thought maybe services could also be helping someone learn more about tradeskill because I'm a complete noob there and like doing tradeskills when I've been on other "worlds".

Expired @ 9/13/2002 10:41:55 AM (Pharma tech/NP skillz 51342):
Finally got a 1k+ NP skill and Pharma tech aswell. Can make treatment laboratories up to ql 200 along with the first aid stims that heal nano and hp at same time.
here is somewhat of a crude pricelist and the skill req for the ql...


treatment laboratories (sit down hp chargers):
Ql109 treatment from 549, heals for 2217, comes in sets of 329 for 400k a set

Ql128 treatment from 643, heals for 2589, comes in sets of 364 for 550k a set

Ql150 treatment from 753, heals for 3020, comes in sets of 406 for 800k

Advanced First Aid Kits (First aid chargers for HP and Nano):
Ql89 first aid from 448, heals for 313-448 hp/nano, not sure on how many come in set for this ql was an old batch

Ql150 first aid from 752, heals for 526-751 hp/nano, comes in set of 120 

Ql177 first aid from 886, heals for 620-886 hp/nano, comes in set of 177
will try to list some lower ql stims as i make em. Havent really set a price on those yet cause they are quite expensive. A set of 400 Ql170's cost me over 3mil to build, so we can work somethin out on those

And last but not least i do have a 1k+ NP and +80 treatment buff


/tell medset ingame or leave a post :P

The weapon making system in ao is half broken and needs alot of love.  ... but  Time will tell where ao wants to take to tradeskill area of the game. 
			
		
	
I disagree.  With a QL119-120ish nano Costs around 400-450K  Yet if you get the disc (free) in a mission the cost of making the disc is about 2K.

As for selling the "crap" discs.   I've been looking at it... 30K for a disc yet when my trader sells the nano it sells for 150K.  Making it costs about 2K so for 2K I gain 120K.  I consider that a decent investment.  With the time it takes to cut a pack of rocks and put together a pack of nanos you can complete 1 pack of rocks and then 1 pack of nanos before your maestroes wear off.    Funcom should extend maestroes to 1 hour.  This would help those of us who master the skills involved for high level creations.

If you really want to make Tradeskill IP points worth it, set some of the NPCs on missions to buy things that only Tradeskills can make. 

Make it that any new item coming in (except for phat boss lewt) requires tradeskills to make. It would be cool if tradeskillers were necessary at all lvls. 

as it stands, its a waste of IP to invest in tradeskills unless in a title cap, or making stuff for characters half your level.

AtomicRabbit @ 9/13/2002 8:25:59 PM (50672):
I think they should just take the xp off doing the tradeskill items, change it to tradeskill points.  Have the points go to a item like a token board,  10k points = 1% to all trade skills.   Maybe have the higher boards add to intel or something.  Would at least make it feel like you are earning a bit more than some cash (That is if they actually feel like paying you.)

It would at least give people that do tradeskills a little bit of a extra reward for puting the IP in the skills.  I think the top board having 10% added to all trade skills would be the max, it would allow people with 1000 in trade skills to be able to earn the board and be able to do the 200+ items easier (I am sure there will be more than a few programs as time goes on).

By the time you can actually afford to dump IP into tradeskills as a trader (title5 cap) you can selfcast Maestros without drains.

Mercatura @ 9/13/2002 9:16:28 PM (49660):
Some people (myself included) are worried that someday FC might decide that MRR ql matters, and 50% or 100% sounds right.

This could nerf someone with (for example) a 190 MRR from making 200 armor.

Knowing that it is actually 10% right now gives us some ammunition if FC tries to claim: "The MRR's QL was supposed to matter, they are not working as intended."

Don't talk to me about Slag's "high prices", because that is BS.

Names - Its that thing that you call yourself and a majority of the other people call you.  In superslangs case that is Slag, therefore his name is Slag.  Call him slang if you want though.

Fanboy -  if he is or if he isn't, how exactly does this affect his ability to peform tradeskills?  No way that I can see.

Waiting - When a person is on every day for hours at a time specifically for the purpose of practicing his fanboyish tradeskills he has less wait time than someone who can be contacted if he is online.  Is it a crime to let people know that they may have to wait in line if there are other customers there?

There are alternatives out there - Jica, Chestity, Toolwoman, to name a few.  People still go to slag.  Why?  Because he's easier to approach and when approached more likely to be able to get what you need done at that time.

Not sure why you are spewing the hate Octo, but you sure are throwing it out there.

I'll tell you: TRADERS should be best in ALL TRADEskills. And engis maybe a bit better in building weapons, as that is something mechanical.
Don't cry - you habe enough advantages vs. traders with your pets.
The traders don't have pets as their "charming" spells make them just standing around like frozen - in fact we ARE frozen then. If you use the low lvl spell you have luck - just 5 min, higher level spells are working for 30 min and more i think. 30 min frozen on the spot - not able to do something.

Roll up an Engineer. Try playing him/her until level 140. Concentrate on tradeskills.

See how much fun that is? Experience! the joy of pet-pathing, as the algorithms and lag zip your pet back two rooms, leaving you to face a Veteran Enforcer all by yourself. Shiver! at the thrills you get from begging buffs from MPs and Traders every time you want to stand a serious chance in PvM. Rejoice! when, in PvP, the 'poor Trader' mezzes your Slayerdroid at first try, drains you for 400 pts of skills, and proceeds to whomp your hindquarters.

Also, please explain the logic behind someone with 'CEO' in their profession title being a lot better at building things than a 'Master Engineer'.

If the title 'Engineer' means 'droid operator' to you, then you really should look 'Engineer' up in any dictionary.

If you have read my post carefully, I already stated that engi should eventually be better at mechanical things like assembling weapons. I just don't understand why engi want to be better then traders in all skills. That is what most are whining for.
And this game should be balaned.
Please explain, in which cases traders have advantages, when the charms line don't work, team heals have been nerfed and plunder will be nerfed in future (with increasing nanoresist) - and don't speak of shotguns - everyone can wield shotgun - with more or less IP costs.
So when you think of balancing - not of what you would like to have, don't you think that traders would be really gimped if they won't be best at trades anymore? Then there would be no single thing (for themselves not speaking of wrangles for others) except for the deprive line left for the traders - and engis would have 2 things - best in trades AND best with pets.
Would that be balancing?

Kzak @ 9/18/2002 8:12:59 AM (42765):
This isn't about making Engineers 'uber' compared to Traders in tradeskills. This is about evening the field out some.

Traders and Engineers both have several green tradeskills.

Yet, Traders are the -only- ones who have any buffs for those tradeskills save for the Expertise nanos. Oh, and the Engineers' 'uber' Philosopher's Stone nano.

Basically, what we Engineers want is to have -some- ability of buffing our tradeskills. Not as good as the Traders' Maestros, but half or two thirds of the effect of the Maestro. For truly high-level tradeskill operations, Traders would still have to be contacted.

Tradeskills is the only area in which there's a real grudge between Engineers and Traders. The other areas - divests, weapon skills, mez, charms - we Engineers don't worry much about, as they aren't suitable to our classes. Traders can keep those areas as they are for me.

This is not a nerfing of Traders. It's about making Engineers a little less dependent on Traders. 

Besides, if we actually get self-buffs for tradeskills, they'll use SI/PM, which are dark blue skills for us, veeeeery IP-intensive.

There are much less traders then engis in the higher lvls (looking at DNW, don't know about RK1 and 2) - think of it, why that is so. And think what will be, if engis will have even more advantages - less traders. Result: less wrangles avaiable 


Killashandra, trader, DNW

Kzak @ 9/18/2002 9:03:11 AM (42765):
Traders have nothing for protection?

You conveniently left out the 'Draw AC' line of nanos.. Pawnbroker's Armor lowers a target's AC by 1200 pts, giving 1190 pts back to the caster, for three minutes.

Not exactly without protection. 

An Engineer can cast Aegis barrier - 720 AC - plus Sympathetic Fortress Screen, giving 627 pts in addition, for 1347 AC total. However, when ACs reach over 4k, the extra effect becomes difficult to notice. Besides, those two Engineer nanos take 116 NCU in total, while Pawnbroker's Armor takes 57 NCU.

Sure, Engineers get.. let's see.. 157!! extra AC over Pawnbroker's Armor, for a cost of 59 NCU more than a Trader's top AC draw. 

I ask you: Which profession has got by far the best deal, AC-wise? 

As for some Engineers wanting to be the best at tradeskills, I know. But I understand that FC isn't likely to let that happen, so I go for a moderate line, so Engineers can get some way of self-buffing their tradeskills. Cooperation is the best way to go.

Presently, a Trader needs a Doc to get in the top implants for tradeskills, so the highest-QL processes can be performed.

An Engineer needs both a Trader and a Doc to do the same process.

Boadicea @ 9/18/2002 9:28:34 AM (42765):
Ok, sorry, my fault. I haven't reached the 100s in lvl so that I forgot this line - as this line is just castable by higher lvl traders.

But if the nanoresist will be increased like it is planned (for 14.5 already - not sure), then you have a unresistable (30?, 40?, 50? min) AC while traders have a 3 min buff, which will be resisted  a lot more and has to be refreshed every other enemy - not speaking of the time for casting in which we will get beaten a lot - while engis have AC already up and have their pet beating the enemy meanwhile. Keeping in mind that we need to keep our deprive/ransack line up, I think this AC line isn't really an alternative comparable to the engi AC line.

Most Traders do the divest/plunder dance in missions, solo or team, so they can keep their high-level nanos up and running. Naturally, some of the offensive nanos will be resisted. In addition to the Draw AC line's bonus to the caster's AC, you also steal AC from your foe.. the aforementioned Pawnbroker's Armor would give you +119 damage to every attack due to the reduced AC, up to max weapon damage. It's well worth it having that damage-bonus in addition to boosted weapon skill from deprives, increased AC from draws, as far as I can tell.

Engineers' bots are infamous for not holding aggro very well.. while it's all well and good having a slayerdroid with you, against an Ace or a Real Mean mob it's like taking a woodpecker to a giant redwood. It takes ages for a bot to knock such a mob down by itself. More likely than not, the same mob will aggro on the Engineer merely for being in line of sight - that's before the Engineer actually begins hitting/shooting the mob. And pulling aggro back to a bot can be tricky, often involving running out of LOS, around corners etc.

Still, let's get back to the core matter: Tradeskills.

Do traders really think it's terrible that Engineers ask to be a little less dependent on them? If my suggestions should (by some miracle) come true, Traders will still be able to charge for Maestros, but Engineers will no longer have to beg for minor and medium tradeskill buffs.

Boadicea @ 9/18/2002 10:16:25 AM (42765):
Maybe you stay alone under all the engis - as (like you can see in the vote) they either want to be better generally or even want their coming tradeskill spells to stack with the traders buffs so they would be uber - that would make me charge high prices for trader buffs to compensate the loss in selling tradeskill-made stuff - or even maybe I even refuse to buff engis to have a chance at the market. 
That is all I want - that traders stay best at tradeskills. 
I don't mind, if engis maybe get some lower lvl tradeskills buffs - they ARE engineers, but perhaps not in all tradeskills or different (maybe chemistry for engis (for weapons)instead of Pharmacy, and and surely no NP - that should stay for MPs - or traders AND engis both should get a buff for NP).

Kzak @ 9/18/2002 10:19:05 AM (42765):
Yeah, Traders will still be best at tradeskills, but they won't be -hugely- better than Engineers. Just somewhat better than Engineers. Which is all I ask for.

Krovsky @ 9/18/2002 10:21:06 AM (42765):
I had originally decided to just read these posts and not reply, but after finishing them alll I decided I may as well add my opinion.  
     

     Tradeskills..some agree to disagree, some love them and some hate them. They are time consuming, expensive < after a while> , frustrating at times and over all just a pain in the butt. My Engi on RK2 is 112, my trade skills are all maxed for level and without playing the implant shuffle I can make stuff in the QL 120 range depending on the type of skill I am using. Thats not too bad, but when you are trying to work on trade skill items at 2 am, try to find a trader to buff you. Or better yet, try to find a trader. Most of them are too low, too busy, lack the skills <even if they are high enough level> or they are just plain rude.


     We are not asking for our skills to be uber, we just want to be able to make the stuff we want to make, within reason, and not have to spend 3 hours looking for someone to buff us.


      As for the remark about making guns and stuff  "things mechanical".. one day when you are bored, go into the store and grab a recipe book, don't matter which one. but for argument sake, grab one on making a gun. Then take a good look at all the skills you need to make a single weapon.  There is alot more to "Mechanical things" than just mechanics. Even something as simple as a gun uses EVERY tradeskill, from Mech Engi, all the way down to comp lit. 


      Maybe you should take a good long look at the skills needed to make even a single weapon, Nano, ring, or anything else. 


      This is not meant as a flame, just to make a point without stepping on toes. Traders trade ALL skills. Everything from combat to tradeskills, and that's fine. We aren't asking to be able to do that, we dont NEED to do that. But as an engineer it would be nice to be able to make a QL 130 nano and not have to hunt down a 50th level trader to get the journeyman buff needed to finish off the last step or 2.

Highorbit @ 9/18/2002 12:09:21 PM (42765):
Since I have always been of the opinion that trade skills should be more widely available I find the constant arguements that suddenly spring up a little obscure.

I'm not going to say that Traders are the best profession in the world, that certainly can't be the case since Engineers appear to out number Traders 2:1.

However, Engineers dependance on others for buffs is very frustrating, especially in the trade skills area, 99% of the time the items you end up building are not for yourself. I don't personally do it for profit either.

I don't think any of us have ever asked for a NP buff that we can use. We already have this obscure +62 Chemistry / Pharma Tech buff. All we ask if for some gadget or buff that would allow us to do roughly the same with ME, EE, QFT and WS.

Would it be so bad if both professions were roughly equal at trade skills?

As it stands Engineers seem to be getting more and more items that add small amounts to trade skills as time goes by. And if this is the way it's either equalised or changed then I'm happy.

On the Engi only side:

Modified A-4000 NCU Sheet adds 40 NCU and 40 to NP
HUD Upgrade: STM adds 35 to EE and QFT

None Engi specific:

OT 12 Grenade Launcher adds 18 to QFT
Handy Steel Ribbed Gloves
Augmented All matching Bow tie
Nano Programming Interface
1000 token board

Future items (Engi only):

Helmet of Technical Cerimonies
Breastplate of Technical Cerimonies

Not a lot of people advertise these skills, but it seems that Engineers get asked a lot more than traders.

Kzak @ 9/18/2002 12:18:40 PM (42765):
Another item that adds to Engi skills, though it has no profession restrictions:

Arwen MO-404 Grenade Launcher.

QL100-199 gives +10 to MechEng, ElecEng and Weaponsmithing, while the QL200 version gives +20 instead.

Well, everything helps.

Traders aren't that easy to play - especially when they focus on tradeskills from early on. Bugged charm and adding more nanoresist won't make it easier. It's hard to solo for me at lvl 73, but I see my trader more as an support character. But on DNW it's not easy to get a team sometimes - even on weekends - as we have still a rather thin population.
Maybe that is a reason that there are much more engis then traders - same reason -  many MAs - easier to play - easier to solo then other professions.
Are there only few engi specific items, or are there some trader specific items as well?

I haven't seen any trader specific items unfortunately. But the Engi items aren't in massive supply and don't really constitute an upgrade to our profession. After all, we may find they are extremely rare and require massive amounts of camping (Mmmmm... what fun).

I find the decline of the trader profession slightly disturbing though, that I think FC should take seriously, especially since Funcom wants so many people and professions to rely on their buffs.

Engi's have also suffered from the repeated nerfs, not in the same way, but we have been putting up with pet pathing for quite long enough in my opinion, and the OE nerf hurt a lot of Engineers. 

I know that not all of my profession would agree with me, but as far as I am concerned fixing pet pathing would consitute a massive fix for our profession and would put the damage we are capable of at higher levels into a fairly pleasant area, since the main problem would be solved: That of the bot just not being able to get to the fight quick enough.

Trade skills are essentially a seperate issue, we are pretty much forced to raise half the skills in order to use our bot properly (all trimmers require trade skills) so that's NP, ME, EE and QFT. Therefore it is kind of annoying to have see an entirely different profession if we would like buffs.

The highest level trimmers for Divert have stupid requirements, and I'm not entirely sure why they even bothered putting them in the game.

For most Engineers weapon skills are something that only high levels can really do. At level 165 I have only just started using a QL200 weapon (OT 12 Launcher). To equip that I had to get mochams to boost PM and SI, then a 132 wrangle to put enough on PM and SI to allow me to run our (Engineers) own Pistol/Grenade buff and also to add to Grenade skill.

I suspect that like Engineers Funcoms vision of what a Trader does is different from the reality that you all face, but nothing that I can really comment on with my level 10 trader 

Anyway, I would like to see an item that can be used by both Engineers are Traders, or anyone that chooses to dump enourmous amounts of IP into trade skills that will allow a certain independance of buffs.

As far as the tradeskills go, I don't care who's better. It's really a pointless arguement. Either Funcom gives engis a buff line or they don't. Either way it will not effect me... Although since there seems to be alot more trade skill oriented Engis as opposed to traders I am all for giving Engis a buff line... here take mine */me gives Engis Maestros* As it stands Traders are really running out of uses here in AO anyway :P

Yes our heals have been nerfed but when you think about it they are still the 4th best in the game.  Using the highest level team heal i will remain at about 50% health starting from 60% not much of a loss considering my teammates all got 1K health.  

I cast any nano i want in mission pretty much at any time.  

I have a weapon on 80ish levels ahead of me and its not OE'd.

I do 3k crits consistently while most of my teammates lay out a few hundred damage and unless with a MA i will take aggro most of the time.

I am vastly superior to any class in tradeskills.

I own PvP( not that i do it much)

I have 6Xql200 NCUs on at level 100.

I have calms for when i get myself into trouble essentially meaning i rarely die when i **** up.

I am seeked out by every prof just to equip their weapon

Any engie who hopes to do any tradeskills needs me.

All profs should be so nerfed.

seriously any trader who thinks they have it so bad should be taken out back and severely beaten.

Cause i remember like a week ago i made a ILW for someone with a rock about ql190 and i tried this morning and it said i needed a rock of atleast ql212.  Like ql200 isn't good enoug and with the freaking insane requirements on the rocks there is no way in hell i will be able to make a ql212 nano until i am level200 myself.

Anyone else know anything about this?

then again maybe you always needed a ql212+ rock and i was halucinating when i made a couple last week with rocks under ql200.

THEDEACON! @ 9/20/2002 8:28:10 PM (Nano programmer assembling QL220 refined implants 53231):
A good nanoprogrammer is hard to find these days.

I am assembling all implants currently in the game, send a /tell to thedeacon.  Pricing will go according to implant QL and yes, I am able to assemble the new refined (up to ql220) implants.  

Self buffed, my np is 1040, however with implants, I have 1247 nano programming skill.  All implants that require over 1040 will be subject to additional fees and customers must provide me with a doctor to assist in getting my original implants back on.

If I am busy in a mission or otherwise occupied, please understand this and do not beg or demand me to meet you somewhere.  Do not ask for 'eta' because the answer will be 'whenever im ready'.  

There are many advantages to seeking out a nanoprogrammer with extremely high skill, outside of the obvious.  If you have lower ql implants (less than ql100) I can usually bump up the ql by as much as 8 (ql 50 implant becomes ql 58, etc).

profession specific templates can also be created for those unsure of what skills to raise.  over the past 13 or so months I have played most of rubi ka's professions and have different nano nanny implant layouts that can be sent to you via e-mail.

Nano programming is also required for creating some other items such as nanocrystals, so please do not hesitate to call on me for the first few steps in making a crystal.  In addition, my buffed agility is high enough to make any special arrow (chem damage arrow, fire arrow, etc) so let me know if you need this service as well.  I have a list of the different special arrows and the QL items needed to make them.

And oddly enough, I am also available to blitz missions up to ql 250.  Let me know what item you need and the price you are willing to pay and I will do the rest.  All costs will be added to final bill.

And yes, I do mochams :P

I only ask that my customers treat me with respect for spending the countless months needed to acquire this skill and understand that I do not work for free.  While my pricing is flexible, I will not assemble a full body of implants for 10,000 credits.  There has to be incentive to keep this skill high.  I don't care to set prices in stone, but part of showing respect is tipping the nano programmer well.  After all, you will probably need us again.

Also please understand that I am not responsible for lost implants or clusters due to lag, LD or gameplay bugs.  This is a known problem and in the past customers have demanded that I buy them new clusters and/or implants and it simply cannot work that way.

I thank you all and hope to hear from you on RK1!!!

Avatar77 @ 9/22/2002 2:45:41 PM (Where can I get shape soft/hard armor instruction discs? 53579):
How can I get these instruction discs? I know these are very rare but I want to get it by myself.

Someone says they're lvl 60 team mission boss loot but I wonder if they drop from normal 60lvl mobs as well, like Grid Armor MK I?

I'm tired of asking someone around my lvl to team with me for a moment...

SUPERSLAG @ 9/22/2002 3:17:30 PM (53579):
From everything I have heard they are ql60 boss loot. which means you will have to pull missions less that ql60 to get it. Loot generaly is higher on boss's than mission ql.

just made a Jobe implant.   Took me 1008 pharm tech instead of nanoprogramming  to put the cluster in a ql 192 implant.

Looked kind of cool though,  +53nano delta in a shining slot.  That could be useful.  Got a screenshot if anyone has a place to put it.

Warlock @ 9/22/2002 9:23:04 PM (53579):
Just to be completely accurate its not a disk, its a pre-programmed photon emitter (PPPE) that you find.

QL60 apparently and team mission only

However I agree that going to Slag Slang isn't your ownly tradeskill choise in the game. If everyone went to him, every other trader/engi would be pissed. And AO would have to split the company up, er...

Anyway, I don't care who does my tradeskills, so long as s/he doesn't charge and arm and a leg, and is a friendly player

I'm at work now so I can't check it, but if I rememer correctly the ql increases as you process a rock, so a ql 120 rock could end up ql 125 Crystal shell (don't know the exact values as I am at work and can't check it right now)

Kzak @ 9/23/2002 2:02:53 PM (52820):
If a rock increases in QL as you process it to a program crystal, I think that's a function of the QL of the tools. Use QL200 tools, you can get a significant increase of QL.

Sort of the same with bio-communitors and monster parts. A QL1 monster part can soon become QL30 if a QL200 bio-comm is applied upon it.

Trapspringer @ 9/23/2002 2:46:27 PM (53692):

Well I am not trying to insinuate I am the only one to do the job by far there are tons of people out there - yes my prices can be steepish for some jobs but.. I am 98% tradeskill that means I am there to help people in a timely fasson 2% being fooling around mabie a blue moon mission.  

When the shape hard/soft armor came out - I did not go for it why? Well I had the money for them that is for sure but I did not want to totaly monopolize I had a huge clientell for other work.
I would then send clients to toolwoman-bighead- chesity etc.

I only try and have fun - isent that what this game is about? heh

i can't say for post-14.5

no matter what ARKs say

Funcom may still be unaware of this bug,
because n00bs keep confusing the LARGE SOFT

and threads like this end with some retard chiming in with
"I have 3 of them in my bank!!"
yet they shut up when people offer millions for a piece.

Wow that arcanum site is nice.

I've been on the AO med site but it makes the instruction mistake of assuming that you know some of what they are talking about.
Meanwhile the treatment library instructions on the arcanum site assume that I am the ignorant goof that I am 

It also answered some questions I had on bronto armor and such, as well as giving much info on crazy stuff I'd never know.

Krabbus @ 9/24/2002 8:24:16 AM (53847):
did legchopper drop it? If it did, it's a part of the soldier quest I think...

Krabbus @ 9/24/2002 8:26:27 AM (53627):
There has been several thread regarding this issue, first of all you need the Preprogrammed Photon Particle Emitter (Shape Hard Armor) that comes in QL60 - bossloot, it's hard to get. Rest of the stuff can you buy in shops

I think you need chemistry to process the plates into the etch, then mechanical engineering to complete the armor with the MRR

Liet @ 9/24/2002 9:30:00 AM (53847):
It is probably part of the last Tir ring quest. So far I am only on the second part, but both those parts require dogtags. First rookie, and second Grunt. If you want to try them out (if you are clan that is), talk to commander Brock at the outpost SE of Tir. The tags drop off OT personell and the type is tied to their lvl, i.e. soft OT drops rookie tags, skilled drop grunt tags.

Liet @ 9/24/2002 9:35:07 AM (52820):
OK thanks Kzak, thats good to know. Do you by any chance have the numbers on the improvement if you use better tools? 
Oh, and does this apply to armor and other tradeskills as well?

Liet @ 9/24/2002 9:39:52 AM (49407):
If you have a yalm, Avalon has two decent location with rocks up to about ql 120, the tree is totaly safe if you fly. The Other location contains a lot more rocks, but is fairly guarded by mobs. Diving rocks from a yalm is still fairly safe though. 
Just though I'd mention it as you did not want to go to a political zone.

Kzak @ 9/24/2002 10:32:56 AM (52820):
No, I don't have the numbers.. but I think there is a formula based on the QL of the tools, the QL of the raw material and the skill. 

No idea if this applies to other tradeskill processes, as I have no personal experience with building armor.

I never raise my chemistry and I was able to etch the carbonium.  Now I know chemistry is required to tan hides and such.

Garamond @ 9/25/2002 3:56:52 AM (50672):
You know.  I've been doing tradeskills since level 5.  I love doing it.  I put almost all my points in tradeskills.  The wonderfull thing is I can still solo missions my level.  Why?  I have a robot.  Perhaps that's the equaliser between the trader and Engineer.  I can use my points to do something I enjoy and still be able to go out and earn money.

Heck.  Maybe I can't do this at higher levels but I've went up 3 different levels from tradeskills alone.  Alot of times I go up half a level with tradeskills and then finish it in a mission.

I'm level 53.  yeah I'm not all that high yet.  I don't care.  I enjoy working in the workshop makeing junk.

Are tradeskills broken.   Yes.  It is insane to have the collective parts cost more than the finished product.  They fixed nano creation.  The community as a whole just has not realised it is cheeper to buy nanos from a player now.

There are several things we can make that can't be found.  treatment labs and restoration kits spring to mind.  Again I don't think the community realises it is there.  Whenever I advertise this stuff they are blown away that I can make something like that.

Heck  I'd venture to guess that 25 precent of the playerbase doesn't know about Plasma.  I'll venture a guess that 75% of the playerbase doesn't know we can refine jewlery.

Hlaf of the problem is the players are used to going to buy things.  They are used to tradeskills getting no love from funcom.

With this newest armor thing players are starting to come out of their shell.  It is unfortunate that funcom made the PPPE so rare.

Yes Tradeskills need love but I think it is our responsibility to bring the bvenifits of tradeskills to the community.

We love it.  Lets show them why they should care.

Garamond @ 9/25/2002 5:36:19 AM (45489):
Based one that comparison I would chose bronto.

I have 80 NCU and I never use NCU's.  As a engineer I never need to.  Armor buff?  Goes on bot.  Damage shield.  Bot.  All I put on myself is expertises for my tradeskills 

I'm sure some professions want the NCU.  I can think of my enforcer alt for one.  I think the choice is rooted on how much NCU do you actually use and do you really need more?

Kzak @ 9/25/2002 10:28:42 AM (53606):
Oof. 1008 Pharma to make the Jobe implants? Well, I'll have more skills to spend my already thinly spread IPs on now. 

BTW, do Jobeclusters drop from solo-missions, team-missions and/or bosses?

Found one Faded cluster of Nano Regeneration, but it's not something I'll put into a Feet implant.. Need my evades-clusters more..

Krabbus @ 9/25/2002 11:40:24 AM (53627):
oki, my fault then

Liet @ 9/25/2002 11:50:39 AM (53417):
Sometimes Bright and Shining clusters takes more NP skill to put in than Faded clusters does. That could be one explanation, if you want help putting it in though, just give Chini a tell. Another reason it might now work could be it is to low ql, is it at least ql18+ ? Normally a message should appear telling you the minimum skill and/or ql of cluster, but sometimes this message does not appear (don't ask me wyh). Other than that I can't think of anything.

Actually, I don't see the need to make the tunic part so dang rare? Noone (nearly) uses bronto anyway? The only people I know who would want to wear it, are low levels, with no creds for carbonum plates. Then hunting brontos for a fullset carbonum is a nice way to get armor.

Funcom won't say whether this "rarity" has to do to some stupid event in the storyline. 

I guess they just don't want us to wear it. :/

***Do to title caps (I'm currently level 140) I cannot make most QL200  items, but i can get close. See the list above for the QLs I can make***

All The Fine Print:
Customers are waited on in a First Come First Serve manner. Most customers are helped and on their way in less then 10 minutes, the better you are prepared (ex. having all the needed parts) the faster you will be on your way happily. 

If you send me a /tell and i don't answer right away or am offline please feel free to send me another /tell a few minutes later. I get many /tells at a time and can get swamped but I will do my best to maintain organization. Also, I do have quite a few alts that I play so you might want to send them /tells also (see signature below, they go in order of importance :-)

If you send me a /tell and I am AFK I will do my best to get back to you (if it's still in the chat window) but if I am afk usually just try me a bit later (15-20mins usually). I have a pretty wide hour range that I am usually logged in and playing and I'm sure at one time or another you've seen me spamming the Omni Shopping Channels if you are ever in OT.

If you have questions about what you need to complete an item instead of asking me first feel free to look at this great website : www.anarchyarcanum.com it's currently where I get all my info and you will probablly get a faster response from it then me, as "Ready" customers come before "Browsing" customers. Once again this helps speed up the process so you and I are both on our ways quicker. I will do my best to answer your questions but please for times sake if you can check the website(s) first it would be much appreciated.

I am a very Trustworthy person who is fairly well know and I'd love to help you. I have created many expensive nanos and items for satisfied customers like Grid Armors, Nullities, Dragon Armors, and Team Beacon Warp. I'm a Vetern of the great and well respected guild HYDRA, and I am proud to represent them and will do my best to please everyone I work with.

Well, that about wraps it up... if you have any questions, comments, praises or complaints please feel free to either post them here or send an ingame /tell to Svpernaut.

See Ya On RK,

Svpernaut @ 9/25/2002 4:35:07 PM (53627):
to make carb you need chemistry and mech engineering... i've made hundreds of suits, trust me.

bronto armor uses chemistry to tan, and agility to make.

plug for the best game site around... www.anarchyarcanum.com that has all the tradeskill info your heart could ever desire.

i don't know the guys who run it, but i appreciate their time :-)

Svpernaut @ 9/25/2002 4:41:13 PM (45489):
garamond wait till you get high level and your fixer friend buffs you with grid space freedom, your ma friend give you mark of peril, your doc gives you uber health, and you are running mochams for your slayer... trust me you will need the ncu. i have 6 ql200 ncu, and i still wear carb. extra ncu is always nice. however if and when the body armor comes out for bronto i'll probably make the switch simply for the looks lol. actually i'll be wearing a full suit of dragon by then ;-)

Elbo @ 9/25/2002 5:25:40 PM (53606):
Its odd (yeah I have 1Kish in pharmtech also now)  Some implants require other skills though.  At least a friend messaged me asking if I had (cant remember.. wasnt pharmtech) so I could build him a 220 implant.

Depends on the implant or cluster.. one of those I'm guessing.

Extra speed does me no good so I would problably delet it.  Mochams I don't want nor will I use.

If I don't have the NCU for stuff I don't get it.  MY problem isn't NCU It's nano points.  Again it's more how you play than which is better.

Kafka @ 9/25/2002 6:48:55 PM (53417):
Are you trying to combine the parts while they are in a backpack?

That's the only instance I've experienced where the imps didn't combine and no message whatsoever was given.

You need to have the items in your main inventory.......at least the last time I checked.

g/l

Svpernaut @ 9/25/2002 6:58:52 PM (53417):
actually when i have been making imps for customers i have run into this problem a couple of times since the 14.5 update. i have also had this problem with some items like sealed weapons when i try to put them together i get no error messages, or anything it just doesn't work when it should. i've tried zoning, relogging, trading again, but it just seems sometimes you get bugged implants and/or clusters now.

i know it isn't lack of np, because i can make up to ql170 imps, and i have had this problem with a couple of lower level imps.

Svpernaut @ 9/25/2002 7:02:36 PM (54361):
why do people charge way more to assemble ql200 sets then say a ql198 set? i've seen this on RK1 & RK2 and i don't get it... all of my armor prices are the same no matter what ql. i understand if you have to hunt for the ql198 or higher pieces of carb, but even if they bring it to you you charge em 5m? ouchies.

i've found in my armor making that i'd rather make money on volume because people it allows me to help people that don't have uber ammounts of credits... it puts everyone on an even plane.

just my $0.02

Those nifty thingies called Nano Rechargers are there for some reason, you know. And if your max nano pool is too low to cast a buff, then it's pretty obvious that you need more IPs in Nano Pool.

Trust me, at higher lvls you WILL want more NCU, just like Svpernaut said. Carbonum is MUCH better than bronto IMO.

Marqis @ 9/25/2002 7:40:54 PM (FC why is pharma so costly? 54372):
Why the heck is pharma teck sooo costly?

To make a ql15ish restoration kit it wouls cost something like 15-20k..thats a bit rediculous and u prolly get 5 =P...ok so resotration kits are out.

The treatment labs blind you i was told..so even know those are a lil more affordable its completely stupid to use em cause u ave to site there until u can see again...so treatment labs are out.

The muscle stim...I used one of these once and it lowered my body developement.. ???

And then theres the swim stim........

Funcom i think u need to add some more stuff to the pharma teck thing...run stim...energy regen blisterpacks, max nano blisterpacks, rezz reduction blisterpacks.....get creative..

oh ya...AND LOWER THE COST OF IT ALL!...way to expensive. i was gonna spec in pharma teck until i realized all this...now im not until somethin is done.

plz look into this =\

is not ingame.

There is "Small Hard". There is "Hard". There is "Large Soft".
but there is no "Large Hard".

I am getting really annoyed at people spreading misinformation
that delays a fix on this. You are confused. You don't have any large hard. 
Noone does. It has never dropped. Noone has a Bronto Tunic.
I have killed thousands of brontos of various levels.
I have seen mission loot up to QL200 of every piece hundreds of times
except the LARGE HARD body part which does not drop.

Jhaenara @ 9/25/2002 11:05:00 PM (53417):
Ohhh hadn't seen all these replies b/c I ended up petitioning it, sorry, hehe.   I thought maybe it was the NP skill thing too and it just wasn't giving me a message.  So I waited another level, buffed and used a tutoring device on my NP skill, then put some other bright and shining clusters in my other implants.  (BTW, both implant and cluster were QL 20, so I knew it wasn't that.)

Anyway, I then petitioned when once again it wouldn't work and they looked at the two objects and said they were aware of bugs with the implants, would report this and were very sorry.  I said it was no biggie, I'd live, I just wanted to know it wasn't me going crazy... lol.

Thanks again for the help...

Anonymous @ 9/26/2002 7:02:01 AM (54361):
Personally I prefer to just make sets and auction them/sell them over vic and shopping channels. That way I can decide how much making the set was worth to me and price it accordingly. So if the set was lower than ql 150, I don't expect much profit. The more imps I have to switch, etc, the more I charge, and I keep it until I find a buyer, somtimes just unloading it at cost. I find that it saves the aggravation of having ppl bother you all the time when you're busy.

Kzak @ 9/26/2002 9:21:45 AM (54372):
Besides, the blindness you get from using an Emergency Treatment Lab has no effect on your combat abilities.. you can fight every bit as well even if you can't see for 30 seconds.

Why invest IP in nano points when Bronto armor will supply me with the points I need.

As for Mochams.  Last time I checked I was a engineer.  Not a MP.

I don't see othe rprofessions begging those people for mochams so they can cast their next buff or whatever.  There is no reason a Engineer should other than personal choice.

Oh gee, i dunno, cause nano pool is important to you? you WILL need those points in your pool later.

but aw heck, why listen to players who have alot of experience playing the game eh? I mean what do we know right?

And i see people begging for mochams ALL THE TIME. ESPECIALLY Engies. IT REALLY is worth your effort, as your bot will be MUCH MUCH meaner..

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 12:45:31 PM (53606):
I use pharma all the time to make plasma and Emergency treatment kits.

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 12:50:04 PM (45489):
Yes I hear you talk about needing this all the time.  I also hear you same people complaining about how much your bot sucks.  I'm perfectly happy with a self casted bot.  If I happen to be in a team with a MP then so be it.  I'll cast a bigger bot.  If not oh well.

Regardless of weather or not I should be oh so worried about mochams or not the origional topic was which is better.  Since you aparently find NCU to be the greatest thing since sliced bread I would imagine you would want carbonium.  Since I personally do not care for it I personally would go for the extra armor and nano boost in the bronto.

I really don't understand why you are getting so bent out of shape about the way I play.

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 12:54:14 PM (53417):
Yeah I had that same problem.  petitioned and said the coders were working on the problem.  They also said it would be fixed Monday 

Wasn't a big issue with me either.  The implant I was trying to put in was a extra anyway.  still I hope it gets fixed soon.

Kzak @ 9/26/2002 1:16:11 PM (54372):
Actually, emergency treatment labs heal 2.66 times the amount of a standard treatment laboratory per hit.

Turning the 'Other Effects' to Off means you'll miss out on some effects, like the glow on bosses, the ripple on zone-borders, and the green effect of old-school LLTSes.

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 1:16:27 PM (54542):
I heard you only need a ql 50 MMR to make ql 200 armor.  My clan is going to go higher than that though.  You never know when funcom will add higher level armor.

well they have already actually but I don't know if that applies to tradeskills yet

Opulent @ 9/26/2002 1:17:02 PM (Anyone work out the formula for reqs to make Carbonum? 54543):

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 1:19:18 PM (53847):

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 2:14:01 PM (54372):
Ok 2.66 if you want to get technical.  A heck of alot more if you don't 

Blindness doesn't bother me overly much to want to open up the options window let alone turn off something  So I'm blind.  If I need to go somewhere I still have my map

Warlock @ 9/26/2002 2:16:46 PM (54542):
Have a look back through the posts here as I'm pretty sure this has been covered.

Dont think you need a QL200 MRR but pretty sure a QL50 wont cut it (QL18x seems to ring a bell for some reason)

Warlock @ 9/26/2002 2:19:25 PM (53606):
Just a reminder that Engineers get a pharma buff (you mean we may actually be asked for it), its not a line though its just a one off +62

Garamond @ 9/26/2002 2:25:06 PM (53606):
yeah.  unfortunately it uses those deep blue nano skills I can't afford to raise.

Kzak @ 9/26/2002 2:36:09 PM (53606):
Philosopher's Stone isn't all that expensive, IP-wise. When you get to level 85 or so, you can begin putting some IPs into PM/SI; raise those skills to 235 (IIRC, the nano requires 257 in PM/SI to cast). Use Expertise for +20, and Int boost for +2. Voila, you can now cast the nano.

RVWinkle @ 9/26/2002 5:32:39 PM (53606):
Agents get a +50 buff, it doesn't stack and they can probably cast the eng one before engineers can. I just looked it up and they can even cast the eng one before they can even cast their own, go figure.

Opulent @ 9/26/2002 5:57:11 PM (54542):
I tried the search before I posted - and while it may have been discussed before - mostly there was a lot of conjecture about a possible nerf and people looking for ql 200's regardless of what worked. Notice I asked if anyone "confirmed" any of this. This would seem to imply to a reader that I had indead read previous posts. RVW, try learning a way to remove the large stick from your ass.

Have a nice day.

Intrepid @ 9/26/2002 6:11:51 PM (54542):
Someone said funcom said ql60+ will make ql200 armour.  The reason is is because it drops at ql60 at that level you would combine with with a ql60ish MMR probably and they want you to be able to use it all the way through the top.  Although as i said just what someone said funcom said nothing i have heard directly.  Makes sense though.  But thats part of the reason i don't believe it cause funcom never makes sense 

My ql60 hard armour MMR currently makes ql200 armour though.  Hopefully it doesn't change.

Opulent @ 9/26/2002 6:30:28 PM (54542):
Thanx Intrepid - that is exactly the sort of anectodal answer I was looking for. I wasn't sure if anyone had made a ql 60 and used it on ql 200 plates.

turning blindness off though also turns the effects of night vision goggles off as well though.  So if i turn blindness off i am blind all the time anyways.

funny on my friends computer i can see fine everywhere but on my computer its dark as hell.  go figure.

Intrepid @ 9/26/2002 7:16:27 PM (54543):
chem would be the determining step in yours.  Believe it requires 900 chem right??  so going on a straight 900/200 thats 4.5 times ql.  so with 684 chem you can do roughly ql150 armour unbuffed.  Just a haphazard guess though its not exactly that probably.

Bionitrous @ 9/26/2002 7:19:25 PM (54372):
Funny thing about this game.  I could probably turn my monitor off and pay attention to the dishes in the sink or the girlfriend and come back and find I've beaten ten monsters and leveled.

So much for involved combat system.

They said they was gonna do something about turning off the Treatment Kit and NT blind effect in an upcoming patch.  Guess you'll just have to <Tab> and hit 'Q' unless they get smart and disable <Tab> while you are blinded.

As for Pharma being expensive, I'm not sure.  I cover the cost of whoever makes me the nice treatment labs so I know they aren't going broke.

Completely agreed.

I ask for MP buffs or trader wrangles sometimes, there's nothing wrong with that, especially if the trader/MP is in your team  

By doing so, I can cast Unexpected Attack and Take the Shot, which would be impossible otherwise, since my nano skills are all title capped and implanted already.

Svpernaut @ 9/26/2002 8:52:40 PM (45489):
garamond there is going to come a time where if you can't cast a slayer you can't find a team. teams are fed up with pet classes (especially engies because we don't have charms, mezzes, roots, and/or healpets) because they are chasing their pets more then they are helping kill mobs. is it the players fault? hell no, but we sure as crap have to suffer the consequences. high level teams want damage and the only way you get good damage out of a high level engie is with a slayer. i understand that you don't want to waste ip in nanopool but its not like you have to have an ungodly ammount of nanopool (at level 140 i have a tad over 3000 nanopool with only 388 unbuffed/unimplanted points in the NanoPool skill).

i'm all for you finding things out on your own, just some high level players giving you their opinion. i love my slayer and i have never said "it" sucked. i have said time and time again that funcom has lousy arse pet pathing but have never had anything bad to say about the slayer itself. it is hard enough finding a good team that lasts more then a couple of rooms in a high level mission much less finding one without the best bot you can cast. does pathing suck? yes. can i work and live around it? yes. for the majority of the time /pet behind works great.

the bottom line is i don't see how people can try and not get the best bot for themselves and their teammates. why wouldn't you want the mobs to die a couple seconds faster? who knows it may just save a life, and that life will probablly be yours.

Svpernaut @ 9/26/2002 8:58:04 PM (54543):
i don't have a formula, but i've compiled a excel spreadsheet that i use... 

what it takes to make a certain ql (if i know it), what ql carb is needed to make that ql (at high levels the carb is 2 levels lower then the finished product), the cost of 7 sheets of carb for that ql (Omni Prices that actually fluctuate a bit), the skills it adds to and how much (NCU, MaxNano, Nano Init), and the reqs to wear it.

if you are going to start making or already make carb, i suggest you do the same, because you will refer back to it very often... as i have. it's great to have so you can /tell people what their skills are and let them know what you think they can fit into and how much it adds for them, and how much it costs.

Opulent @ 9/26/2002 11:09:36 PM (54543):
It's a good thought - I think I'm just going to buy a bunch of ql 160+ sets of sheets and just see if I can figure the formula buy trying them sans buffs. The 4.5 was mentioned in earlier posts - but that really looked more like a guess based on QL 200. I'll keep track of what I find and try to post it soon.

Opulent @ 9/26/2002 11:17:50 PM (54629):
So far I've only had instances where a cluster wont combine at all with an implant even though it should - no message gets generated of failure - it just wont even respond to the interface. WebMD handles most of the implants for our guild and he has reported numerous problems to ARK and GM and asked for a warning to be placed on the launcher. That request was ignored.

I have no problems paying doctors and other pharma tech. specialists to make these invaluable treatment labs, which make life so much safer, and easier for me and my teams.

Examples:

Zoning down from boss room to quickly restore almost all your hp and get back up to kick the boss's ass again.  This will be greatly appreciated by any team when the doc's healings aren't enough to keep the tanker alive.

For Fixers using the rapid grid teleport nanos, restoring health from the 1 point you are left with.

When soloing missions, quickly healing up between mobs (or during hard fights for calming professions).

That's why I easily pay whatever the cost + 100k or more to the person who can make me what I need

Drusillus @ 9/27/2002 3:49:01 PM (Instruction Disc Suggestion 54840):
I make a lot of nanocrystals, and I think it would be really helpful if the instruction discs would list which profession the resulting nanocrystal is for.  This way, when I have a disc, I know:

- Who to ask to see if it's worth building
- What store terminal to check to see if it's rare, or what its store value is

Yes, I could print of a 30 page list of every nano in the game and what profession it's for, but there should be an easy way to do it in game.

What do you guys think?

Elbo @ 9/27/2002 6:02:34 PM (54840):
Every disc is worth building since you can increase the value of when you even sell it in the store by 5X (30K for QL182 disc but when made 150K)

But I do agree.  Add the stinking profession.  I hate seeing QL130-150ish discs and I'm thinking.. is this yet ANOTHER adventure nano...

I just play for fun.  If Noone teams with me so what?  It'll take me two days to level instead of a hour?  Maybe I won't level up at all.  What difference does it really make?

Heck I don't play my engineer to fight.  If I am wanting to go fight I load up my enforcer.  that is what he is designed for and yes he is going to outlevel my main, engineer,  pretty quick.  I play my engineer soley to make junk and to RP with my guild.  As such every IP I spend with my engineer is valuable.  tradeskills come first then come my bot skills then everything else.  As such it is my preference to wear Bronto armor.  I'm sorry if such a concept does not fit into your little world.

Mercatura @ 9/27/2002 10:00:22 PM (45489):
The original poster wasn't asking what roleplaying armor to wear 

Carb is the strong choice. Build a suit every ~10 qls and you're set. Level up and outfit a whole guild with your old armor.

Bronto is missing a key part and the higher ql hides don't drop all that often. (either that or they are all getting ninjalooted in my teams...doubt it) Building a suit will 'cost' more, if not credits, time for sure.

They both have the same weak spots (energy/rad) and good acs in general. So it all comes down to bonuses, requirements and availability.

Carbo Carbo Carbo!

If you can afford a soft armour pppe you can probably afford to buy a q200 mmr.

Not a particularly contructive post but my personal opinion is play it safe. Find a 200 and use that. Then you are certain to be able to make 200's, if they change it about you are safer, and if they put in >200 quality armour pieces the  you should still be ok.


In the long run you know it makes sense.

Slyyk @ 9/29/2002 12:24:42 AM (54917):
Tradeskills is borked, in my opinion. It is obviously geared towards people over level 100+ due to the high level of points needed to put into skills (except for Mps with nanoprogramming buffs and NTs which have enough IP at lower levels to maintain a decent level of skill in that one area) when IP is soo badly needed elsewhere.

Most of the weapon creation kits are still broken, making it useless for anyone of any level to try those out without extensive research outside the game at tradeskill sites. It's great that people have put in a bucketload of time to find out what is broken and what isn't. But at the same time, why bother? It's not like you can make more than 8 weapons that can't be found in a store or gained as loot anyway. Even those weapons that are in demand from tradeskills (Sol Chironis, Adventure pistols....etc.) are made from hacked receptacles and don't even use the tradeskill kits.

Ah, but you say we have the wonderful new armors that are available. Well, tell me what first-time low-level person who just found that QL 60 Shape hard/soft armor PPPE has the 840,000 and some odd credits required to purchase a QL 60ish Mass Relocating Robot!!! Then there is the 100's of thousands of credits for each piece of the carbonum if you want that kind of armor. Look at it this way, I just had 3 pieces of carbonum armor turned into armor for my low level NT alt. At 1.5k per ql that the craftsman charged to make it, per piece of QL 48 armor, then add the cost of the carbonum pieces (I forget exactly how much), it added up to just under a half a million credits. 

Unless something is done to lower costs of tradeskills and give higher level players a money sink other than twinking out their alts (which I admit I am guilty of) this will quickly become an elitist game where true newcomers will be completely left out in the cold because those of us that started in the first year will have billions of credits we don't know what to do with and drive up prices on things phenomenaly higher than they already are.

Just my 2 cents, currently worth .0002 and dropping.

Can make any QL.  Bronto,  Dragon and Carbonum.

The armor pppes need to be a 100 times more common than they are now. Actually, they should be dropping in disk form dangit.

Tradeskill armor is either rare or expensive for the lower levels already. Nobody pulls a bunch of ME+Chem out of their *** either.

Carbonum = Twink armor. I like it, I have plenty of cash but lol god help the newbs.

Tradeskills in general for anyone but engys (sort of, even then not really) are pretty much a joke sub ~150. You really have to trash your char's IP one way or another to use most of them for items your ql range.

PS you have to mule credits over 1 billion. The exploiters figured that one out

Slyyk @ 9/29/2002 1:23:40 AM (54917):
Even engies have it rough. Mine is 115 and all his equipment (including implants, though they were made for him) is in the 100-115 range self equipped. This includes skills enough wear QL 100-123 Elite and Nano armor (I like the look of the nano sleeves), dual wield 2 QL 100 OET Jess pistols, making QL 105ish rings, and making a QL 100 Aggresion and using all 4 trimmers of QL 100, and enough comp lit for a 6 slot NCU belt. Then I had a friend who wanted a QL 63ish Fixer nano made from a disc.

I figured this should be no problem. Well guess what? Without getting buffs or having special implants made for certain skills (I already have wpnsmth, quantum ft, and mech eng implanted normally for trimmer use), I used up all my saved IP for nano prog and electrical eng, etc., and now he has just a tad over 2,000 IP left. Still, he can only make Nanos from discs half his level.

Mercatura @ 9/29/2002 3:21:45 AM (54917):
Alrighty then  I'll correct myself.

Tradeskills are a joke for all classes before title5

Naughti @ 9/29/2002 3:39:13 AM (54917):
I was just trying to make a lil treatment library stat thing for my doc, but basically its just blowing cash since I have no idea what quality to get for what quality and what hacker tool is needed. There is no site with info like that. I finally find one that hacks a surgery clinic thing but then I need higher break and entery to hack the lowest pharma tech tutor thingie I can find.

I wish stuff like that was more straightforward or had quality level examples in the books.

magicalsteve @ 9/29/2002 1:44:22 PM (54917):
I agree.
Tradeskills need to be profitable for all levels, to make up for the IP sink, and raw materials used for making stuff should be more common in treasure chests, and corpses.

Instead of them being useful only for rich lvl 150+ ppl, they should be for all. People should be able to almost make a living from them. 

BTW jewellery needs to be improved also. I tried it and made bugger all money out of it. I loved being a jewler, but everyone stopped collecting gems to trade, because even when I split the profits 75/25 in their favour, for gem/stone polishing and ring making, they still walked off disgusted at how little money was made.
Yeh, right, maybe you make lots of money at lvl 150-200, but that's not good enough.


Tradeskills are for everyone!

You don't really make a "lot" of money at high levels either, except in rare cases. You can make a living though 

Those cases usually involve something like supergluing a +80 doctor to your butt 24/7 or getting a hard armor pppe the day its patched.

Normally I solo. I just team up for lack of anything better to do and a change of pace. I didn't buy this game to level up the fastest or get everything there is to get by level 2. I just play for fun. If Noone teams with me so what? It'll take me two days to level instead of a hour? Maybe I won't level up at all. What difference does it really make? 

Heck I don't play my engineer to fight. If I am wanting to go fight I load up my enforcer. that is what he is designed for and yes he is going to outlevel my main, engineer, pretty quick. I play my engineer soley to make junk and to RP with my guild. As such every IP I spend with my engineer is valuable. tradeskills come first then come my bot skills then everything else.
			
		
	
Roleplaying


	
		
			
			
				Trust me, at higher lvls you WILL want more NCU, just like Svpernaut said. (actually, you won't get to higher levels anytime this century without more - me)
...
And i see people begging for mochams ALL THE TIME. ESPECIALLY Engies. IT REALLY is worth your effort, as your bot will be MUCH MUCH meaner..
...
I ask for MP buffs or trader wrangles sometimes, there's nothing wrong with that, especially if the trader/MP is in your team.

By doing so, I can cast Unexpected Attack and Take the Shot, which would be impossible otherwise, since my nano skills are all title capped and implanted already.
...
the bottom line is i don't see how people can try and not get the best bot for themselves and their teammates. why wouldn't you want the mobs to die a couple seconds faster? who knows it may just save a life, and that life will probablly be yours.
			
		
	
(Power)Leveling

I have no problem with mostly roleplaying characters, nor will I try to change the way they play. (cough unlike some people cough) I probably have 1 or two myself that would qualify.
But using them to choose the better armor...um...lol no.

BTW;

	
		
			
			
				I don't see other professions begging those people for mochams so they can cast their next buff or whatever.
			
		
	
I see it all the time. They also ask for wrangles all the time. If theres a soldier in the team, I don't even ask. Its wrangle = RRFE or maybe OS.

Oh yes, the nano pool difference between a full suit of ql200 bronto and ql200 carbonum is: holds breath

WOW 

Bronto Hide is still great armor by itself, better than most of the normal armor in the game.

i got to a basic shop im like eh only spent 2k on the thing and the guy had 4 of em if i screw it up ill buy another so i buy a ql21 mrr and combine em well STUPID ME i had both the pppe shape soft and improve thrusting next to each other and ended up combining the shape soft and ql21 mrr sigh i thought i was in deep ****

ok so i talk to slang and chestypoo they say eh should be ok i was still scared brought ql200 bronto to ayashii and shape soft and it worked fine so unless its a bug i dont think ql matters atm

ql21 mass relocation robot (shape soft) + ql200 hide = ql200 bronto pants

Garamond @ 9/30/2002 8:44:17 AM (54542):
There are a few tradeskills like that.  Normally they standardise the ql of the device though.  like gem cutters are all ql 10 if I remember right.

I'm kinda suprised they did that with MMR's. Especially since they get extremely expensive at higher levels.

Lirona @ 9/30/2002 5:35:59 PM (54372):
For a QL 5 stim, it costs about 28K a stack.

For a QL5 Lab, it costs about 36K a stack.  (Figures are approximate and Pre 14.5)

These things (which could have been the backbone of the Tradeskill economy) are simply too expensive at lower levels, and apparantly it doesn't scale up too well.  Yes, they're VERY good but they're nowhere near good enough to justify blitzing QL5 missions for three playing days to get one.  

And even if you do, there's nobody to sell them too.  Yes, you COULD use them yourself but since this is a tradeskill I assume the original intent was to TRADE them for something.

This is just about unacceptable.  FC really needs to lower the price of these components at lower QLs so that players in this bracket can make and sell them at a small profit.  Sure, they should be expensive but more along the lines of 5K to make, and even that's probably a bit too much for newbies.

And don't try to feed me the "This is meant for high levels only" line, either.  Monster Parts are probably a more common find at low levels than high levels (no, I can't say this for sure, having not been up there yet.) If this holds completely true, it means that there's no reason a low-level character shouldn't have access to the pharma-tech items that would have made their low-level lives so much easier.

Garamond @ 9/30/2002 6:24:43 PM (54372):
Why do I always hear the line tradeskills are only for higherlevels.

I've been doing tradeskills since level 7.  Heck at low levels it's possible to gain levels through it.  I know. I did it 3 times.  Tradeskills exclusivly.

YHes it's expensive.  Way too expensive.  nanos are reasonable now however.  at levels 1-15 I would agree with a statment that you are just trying to get your feet  and you don't have a whole lot to work with.  Still a low level person can effectivly do tradeskills.  heck if you get a group of newbies together they could be supplying the one newbie with all the parts he needs.

Emergency kits aren't really needed at level 5.  Plasma however is extremely valuable at level 5.  It's all a matter of what you need when you need it.  Noone needs carbonium armor at such a low level.  You are going to gain levels so fast you'll outgrow it too quick.

Edit:  This is in no way saying that the prices are correct.  In my opinion all tradeskills except nano parts cost 10x too much.  In fact they fixed the nano parts because they were too high. It makes me wonder why they don't fix the other tradeskills.

BigGreen @ 9/30/2002 7:57:24 PM (tradeskill n00b 55528):
Hi all,
I have a low level trader (lvl 25), and I'm trying to make my first nano crystal, which was based on a QL 20 "improve thrusting weapons" instruction disc.  Following the Anarchy Arcanum site (www.anarchyarcanum.com) instructions, I assembled the instruction disc into a Programmed Photon Particle Emitter (Improve Thrusting Weapons).  I then prepared the Carbonrich Rock, making a QL 27 Prepared Program Crystal - Space after several steps.  The two items will not combine to make the nano crystal!  Is the QL too different? is there something I'm missing?  A guildmate mentioned that I needed a Mass Relocating Robot to use on the Prepared Program Crystal, but those are 300k or more in the shops and I'd rather know ahead of time that it's really needed, especially since it's not mentioned on Anarchy Arcanum.  Can anyone verify this or tell me what I'm doing wrong?
Thanks!!

RVWinkle @ 9/30/2002 10:23:28 PM (55528):
The item you describe is meant to be combined with a Mass Relocating Robot. It doesn't turn into a nano crystal. Check out this alternate guide on the anarchyarcanum http://www.anarchyarcanum.com/weapons_improving.html

BigGreen @ 9/30/2002 10:40:41 PM (55528):
Ok, so just because it's an instruction disc doesn't necessarily mean it's a nano crystal! Got it, thanks for the clarification. I just picked the wrong disc.

Lirona @ 10/1/2002 2:07:12 AM (54372):
Why do I always hear the line tradeskills are only for higherlevels.
			
		
	
The reasoning behind this line is simple:  Tradeskills are an expense that is far out of proportion with level.  No newbie and few lowbies can get away with it simply because all the tradeskills pre 14.5 were money sinks that didn't produce anything worthwhile except for blood plasma.  At higher levels they're viable without being massively twinked.  This makes it look like AO tradeskills are meant as a mid-high level playground, something that you're not SUPPOSED to be doing without first doing your time in the killing fields.

This was really my point.  Perhaps a treatment lab or a stim isn't really necessary for a low-level character, but the simple fact is is that there's no practical way to find out because the option isn't available.  Notice how I said that a 5K production for a low level treatment lab seemed more than reasonable.  I still think very few fifth level characters would really want to be running around with them, and the sheer expense would probably prevent it, but it would be possible for a low-level character to see the entire tradeskill process early on and decide if a tradeskill character is really the type of thing they want to spend their money on.

Garamond @ 10/1/2002 11:16:11 AM (54372):
That's something else that has always baffled me.  Why do I have to go pound things to goo to learn the latest theories in quantumn physics.

Geez.  yeah I have to go get money somehow but you would think We could get some decent xp from building stuff.

And before people start screaming about how losers who just build stuff shouldn't level up.  how would you like it if you had to build stuff to level up so you could fight harder stuff.

Yeah starting at level 7 wasn't easy at all.  It was something that made a couple members in my clan wonder.  but you do get parts at that level.  Just start putting them togehter.  Most people will give them to you at that level as well.  It isn't as expensive as all that especially if you are careful about only getting the parts you need.  That was what was so tough in the begining. I couldn't aford to slap a ql 40 part on a ql20 gun.  I had to go find a ql 20 part either in the shops or in a mission.

Athen was my friend during my early levels.  That's why I still hang out there

Slicse @ 10/2/2002 5:47:21 PM (Implant building question 56069):
say i have a QL 80 left wrist implant, and add a QL 80 shining Akimbo style cluster. It gives a 45 multi-range skill increase, but requires 164 psychic secondary skill to equip. However, if I add a bright sprinting cluster to it, the secondary skill changes to 164 agility. 

The question is- I only need the implant for the multi-range skill, so does the bright sprinting cluster need to be around QL 80 as well, or can i buy the cheapest workable bright sprinting cluster(just to get the secondary requirement to switch to agility). Will it affect the +45 to multi-range at all? thanks

Nano Stims

Are the ql's you listed just guides or are they fixed? Can you make ql's in between? My First Aid skill is currently around 580.

And you didn't mention nano rechargers (sit down) or normal nano or normal health stims. I would be interested in those as well.

Svpernaut @ 10/2/2002 8:22:03 PM (56069):

My wife and I recently tried out the 7-day trial of the game and we both love the game and are going to stay with it (AC accounts being closed soon, and now no plans to buy AC2, AO is better .  We don't have tons of time to devote to it but will play as often as we can.  

We want to be able to end up making nano formulas and implants, etc for all of our characters.  I play a soldier and martial artist currently, and my wife plays a bureaucrat and fixer, and we know these professions are not the ones to be working on tradeskills with.  However, with 8 char slots, that's a lot of variation available, (and I have my eye on those huge engineer robots with the big claws hehe) so making 'tradeskill' class characters won't be a problem.  

My base question is, which professions are best for being able to create the different items? Is an Engineer the best for making them all, or a Meta physicist, or a Nano technician?  Is one best for implants while another best for formulas?  What about weapon crafting?  Can one profession do it all (trader?) or do we need to make different ones for each type of trade? 

Thanks in advance for any and all help

Intrepid @ 10/3/2002 12:55:58 AM (56117):
Engineer is best for making none of them.  Except chem skill i think engies are best at cause they have a buff for it.

 ME EE QFT WS Pharma and comp lit are all bested by traders.  See MPs for nano programming and fixers for any hacking you require.

Engineer is not a tradeskill prof they just give you green tradeskills as requirements for your trimmers.  Don't worry your not the first one to be caught in the engie aren't tradeskillers trap.

Secondly of engie fixer MP and trader, engie is going to be the hardest to find teams for.  On my trader when i form teams i;ve had people(mostly docs) come up to be and tell me they will leave team if i recruit a engie as well.

Honestly in this game right now there is no reason to play a engie cause the pet is not nearly as strong as it looks.  Hits like a school girl and can't take aggro worth a damn.

Take this advice from a level 167 engineer.  Make a trader.  I did.  after 45 fewer days online time my trader is less then 30 levels behind.

Did i mention as a engie your gonna get very sick of having to buff beg for anything and EVERYTHING you want to do?  Trader self buffs everything they could possibly need.

Unless you really wanna solo from 1-125 then a engie would do nicely but seeing as you say you play with your wife don't choose a engie it will just slow you down.

Krabbus @ 10/3/2002 9:47:12 AM (56117):
If you are planning to make a tradeskills char that is below level 100 I would make an engineer, but you can always make a trader and reset the skills when you don't plan to level it anymore.

Traders have tradeskills buffs, that buffs +40, +80 and +125. At level 80ish can you selfcast the +80 buff (without divest).

If you have two accounts, I would make an engineer and trader on seperate accounts, engineers are best (and easiest to maintain tradeskills) when they get tradersbuff...

MountainBear @ 10/3/2002 12:08:36 PM (Customizing items 56263):
It would be cool if everyone could buy and use robots. Also it would be possible to repair, improve, fine tune your robots. The engineers would have access yo higher level moification. Also anyone could buy and use a robot but only engineers could manufacture them from parts.

same for vehicles.

Also you could add guns, nano programms and stuff to your robots.

For the metaphysicist, he can't customize his pets but he could tutor them, and they'd make Experience and levels as well.

Just to point out hopes and thoughts.

When the 400QL armor comes out in the expansion pack sometime next year.  Will your QL60 MMR hard/soft armor still work above 200?  Can we say LLTS sort of nerf on these items?

I can easily see them doing in the MRR's to 'adjusted quality levels'.

Now in business.  I've recieved a few calls from people on this so I thought I would inform everyone offically.  Also I can make the following.

Treatment Packs (emergency)
Stims of all sorts.
Treatment Libraries (QL200ish you get them hacked by a fixer I can do the rest)
Hard Armor (carbonum)
Soft Armor (dragon/bronto)

I can do 172ish unbuffed after that I'll need a few buffs to go higher.

Virral egg SWAPS! (yes thats right no wait just msg me and I'll swap you if you have all the parts. (QL220+ gold bars do not count)

Nano Crystals up to QL215.   If you have something that needs to be done that is under QL100 bring your own rock and I'll do it for free (unless you got a bag of them..)

Pays007 @ 10/3/2002 5:34:52 PM (47484):
thats really depends on the person ding them. some people charge more, some people take tips, some people will do it for free.

Mostly likely you'll fine people just asking for tips.  Especially for  a lower ql implants which isn't that hard to obtain the skill level to do them. 

It  usually is nice to tip what you can, keep in mind that theyb are saving you lots of time, effort and IP.

As for an exact suggestion of price... im not really sure.  But i can tell you that for an entire set of 13 ql 90ish implants the average tip i recieve is about 300-400k

Provisioner @ 10/3/2002 9:30:42 PM (56117):
That depends on a lot of things:

1) Engineers are, hands down, the best at Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Field Quantum Physics, and Weapon Smithing.  Why?  Well:

  - Engineers and Traders will both max out at the same in all 4.
  - Although Traders hold the buffs for these 4 skills, engineers still have access to them (they must ask a trader for a buff).
  - Engineers have profession-specific items to boost these skills (some of which, like the Giraldi crystal, are incredibly easy to obtain) - traders have none at all.  If you're serious about tradeskills (and not just damage output), gear your character towards these items.

By-and-by, engineers beat traders in these 4 skills hands down (regardless of what Intrepet says).  The only issue is asking for buffs, but I hate to tell you - EVERYONE has to ask for buffs in AO.  Most would suggest that you join a guild willing to buff you...

2) Pharma Tech - Traders lead due to their pharma-tech buff, but all three (doc, engy, and traders) have buffs to easily get them over 1k skill requirements.  The jobe implants may make exceptions to this rule, and it is hoped (at least by me) that docs recieve more pharma-tech items to compensate...

3) Nano-Programming - Both engineers and traders suffer in this category.  However, if you're "sided" with Omni or Clan, you'll have a nice boost to get you over 1k easily (actually, I'm certain ANY class with a 1k token board reward, maxed NP, and implants can make the 1k implants).  The buffs for NP come from MPs.

4) Computer Literacy - Traders stomp every other class in the game with this "trade skill".  At higher levels, traders can beat any other class by about 250 as their buffs are self-only.  However, the TRADESKILL requirements for complit tend to be fairly low - and don't forget the HUGE bonus to comp lit from the 1k token board reward.  No profession should have any problem getting 1k comp lit, but many chose not too as it has little use after 400 or so (as people equip their top belts and such and forget about the skill).

5) Psychology - Huh?  What?  Tradeskill?  Well, it's listed there, so I'll cover it for completeness.  It has no tradeskill function that I can think of.  As for other functions, it's rumored that it will reduce the cost of items to NPCs as comp lit does for machine shops.  However, I can price an item when I'm fully buffed (around 700 psych), die, and price the same item in rez shock for the same price.  Crats have the buffs for this "trade skill", but it is failry useless right now.

6) Chemistry - Self-buffed, engineers have the best skill here as well (I won't bother with agents, as they aren't really tradeskillers).  Sharing buffs, it's even across the board.  If the "Breastplate of Technical Ceremonies" is dropping (not sure), engineers beat every other class here as well.

7) Tutoring - To many, tutoring is actually one of the most useful of tradeskills.  Maxed tutoring will allow the tradeskiller to raise a skill by +50 for 2 minutes.  Also, each class has an even chance of raising the skill...with one exception - the engineer.  The engineer's Giraldi crystal provides and additional 125 to tutoring (roughly 200 tutoring if you're using a lower QL in the off-hand).  No other class has a profession-specific tutoring bonus from items such as this.

So, to sum it up:

Mechanical Engineering - Engineer due to prof-specific items, but must be social and ask for buffs.
Electrical Engineering - Engineer due to prof-specific items, but must be social and ask for buffs.
Field Quantum Physics - Engineer due to prof-specific items, but must be social and ask for buffs.
Weapon Smithing - Engineer due to prof-specific items, but must be social and ask for buffs.
Pharmacutical Tech - Traders if self-buffing, followed by docs and engineers.  All three are equal if buffs are shared.
Nano Programming - MP if self-buffing.  All classes lag behind the MP in Nano Programming, but the 1k token board reward boost is enough to get anyone over 1k.
Computer Lit - Traders.
Psychology - Crats (but who really cares!) :P
Chemistry - Engineers
Tutoring - Engineers, no 'ifs', 'ands', or 'buts' about it.

So, if you don't mind being social and asking for buffs:

1 - Engineers lead 6/10 at being "the best"
2 - Traders in 2nd with 2/10 at being "the best"

However, both can function quite well at tradeskilling.  If you want someone that is "good" at trade skills and okay in PvM, pick a trader.  If you want someone "great" at trade skills, but must invest IP into other "useless" skills (such as MC and TS for the bot, and misc skills for things like crystals) pick an engineer.

Acually the eng crystal can be matched by traders in the endgame with a khan. Save for the skill reqs the Khan is better overall since you can dual wield a jess with it.

http://auno.org/ao/db.php?cmd=view&id=123960&t=ag

The way I see it is that tradeskills in this game were meant to be social as in you need buffs from others to get most stuff done. The simple route is the Trader since they have massive self buffs that they can cast easily due to their drains. The engineer stands out if you intend to spend alot of time and meet several conditions. First you have to have lots of friends, i.e. a good guild. Then you have to drag these friends out for long camping sessions to get unique nodrop items that aren't guaranteed to drop. If you spend alot of time acquiring these rare items then you can get buffed by other profs and be better than anyone else by 55 points or less.

Thanks all for the kind replies.  It's a lot of information to digest, but very worth it!  For my wife and I, we plan to go ahead and have her make a trader and me an engineer, not as main characters but to be helped along by our main characters.  Our big interest is in being able to create the various items that we'll need for ourselves and friends as we progress, and it looks like this combination will do the job   Any additional information is very much welcomed!

Just wanted to say that an Engineer at level 125 can make QL160ish nanocrystals selfbuffed (QL125 implants swapping), QL180ish Mausser and QL160 jewellery with all tradeskills maxed and abilities such as sta/agi/int/psy.

Also playing a trader, and teaming is much more fun with this profession (backup healer, calming, massroot, wrangle etc.)

That depends on a lot of things:

1) Engineers are, hands down, the best at Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Field Quantum Physics, and Weapon Smithing.  Why?  Well:

  - Engineers and Traders will both max out at the same in all 4.
  - Although Traders hold the buffs for these 4 skills, engineers still have access to them (they must ask a trader for a buff).
  - Engineers have profession-specific items to boost these skills (some of which, like the Giraldi crystal, are incredibly easy to obtain) - traders have none at all.  If you're serious about tradeskills (and not just damage output), gear your character towards these items.

By-and-by, engineers beat traders in these 4 skills hands down (regardless of what Intrepet says).  The only issue is asking for buffs, but I hate to tell you - EVERYONE has to ask for buffs in AO.  Most would suggest that you join a guild willing to buff you...

2) Pharma Tech - Traders lead due to their pharma-tech buff, but all three (doc, engy, and traders) have buffs to easily get them over 1k skill requirements.  The jobe implants may make exceptions to this rule, and it is hoped (at least by me) that docs recieve more pharma-tech items to compensate...

3) Nano-Programming - Both engineers and traders suffer in this category.  However, if you're "sided" with Omni or Clan, you'll have a nice boost to get you over 1k easily (actually, I'm certain ANY class with a 1k token board reward, maxed NP, and implants can make the 1k implants).  The buffs for NP come from MPs.

spoken like a person who has obviously never played a engineer.  

The giraldi crystal is not possible to equip IP wise til well after level 170 unless you are gimping yourself or not doing tradeskills in which case there is no reason to use it.

The breastplate and helmet of techincal ceremonies has not dropped in game yet. People think it drops of the same mob as the doc version but i have not seen one person come out and say they have the engie version.

Trader and engineer have exactly the same tops in all these skills right now the only difference is the trader who doesn't have to hunt down buffs every 30 minutes

I have a level 131 trader and a level 167 engineers and let me tell you from experience not from the "theory" provisioner has.  Trader knock the socks off engies for tradeskills.

This is from Virral's engie site, hope it helps ya.  I would offer to make it but can't craft 200qlty items yet.  lol....good luck!

 ****Chemical Weapons, don't ya just love 'em? 

Prepare to become the Fixer's best buddy  With 13.6 comes a new Tradeskill, a pretty specific one in fact. It is now possible to modify Mausser Particle Streamers into Mausser Chemical Streamers. Basically, this means that for the small cost of items from your local Trade store, you can change a mausser so that it uses Chemical damage rather than Projectile damage. Do I really need to explain why this is a good thing? 

And the process is so simple, you will wonder why we never tried it before! Basically, just follow these four simple steps, and you will have fixers hero-worshipping you for all time!

Step 1) Take your Mausser, and use a Hacking Tool on it. This will give you a Mausser Particle Streamer Base of the same Quality Level (I assume this uses Break and Enter skill, so the Fixer might have to do this step for you).

Step 2) Head to the nearest Ranged Weapon Components Vendor, and get a Compression Chamber for Chemicals. Use this on your Mausser Base, and you will get a Mausser Chemical Streamer - Step 1 (This step requires Weapon Smithing) 

Step 3) Now, get yourself a Composite Barrel and add this to your Mausser Chemical Streamer, this will result in a Mausser Chemical Streamer - Step 2 (This step requires Weapon Smithing) 

Step 4) Finally, go to the Armor and Clothing Components Vendor, and buy a Sheet of Curved Carbonum Plating. Add this to your Mausser, and you will be rewarded with a Mausser Chemical Streamer, that will be the same Quality as the original weapon. (This step requires Mechanical Engineering).

For those interested, here is a quality 200 version of the Particle and Chemical Streamers for comparison  Basically your looking at a change in damage type, a higher crit, slightly more damage, lower range and a higher skill requirement. A pretty reasonable tradeoff, in my opinion.

Pretty cool hey? Tradeskills are getting more interesting all the time!
 
 
 


 A more in-depth comparison. 

Well, since I posted this guide, several people have submitted more details concerning the changes from a Particle Streamer to a Chemical Streamer. So, here is a broken down list of what will be changed during the process (Most of this information was sent in by Sabor Panthur)

"I have made 10+ so far in QL 30-116 and have made these opservations.

A. SMG/SG Req per QL is 5.3 (so QL 100 needs 530 SMG/MG skill)
B. Burst Req per QL is 4.0 (so QL 100 needs 400 Burst Skill)
C. If you stast with a QL X Mausser, you end up with a QL X+1 to QL X+3 Mausser. (So if your customer want a QL50 Chem Mausser, I'd use a Q48 or Q49 base Mausser)
D. The base damage is 50% greater
E. The Crits are 50% greater
F. The Reqs are exactly 30% more then for the same QL Mausser."
G. The Attack Time is increase by roughly 2 seconds. (Sent in by Zpyke)  ******

200 trader or doc can get ~1100ish

~720 maxed
210 imps

little more from items and ability boosts

Hopefully no implant requires 1200 PT, it might be possible for a 200 nanomage doc dualing 2 pistols and maxed tutoring though. Real hard.

Hmm, I'm all for adding 210 pharm to the token board. Or making more boards past 1k and adding it to them 

BTW having 1200 NP means leaving in some NP clusters, not many people do that since 1000 is enough for everything but shining max nano.

melee ac 1000

run speed -50
dodge ranged -50
evade clsc -50
duck explosives -50
nano cost modifier 3%

This can actually be ANY version of the armor   Very Light through the Heaviest.  Any quality as well.  You'll need to have a Neutron Displacer that is at least 50 % of Armor Qlty.  You can buy these in one of the tools machines in the Trade Area of the stores.  Then it is an easy one step process:

Tank Armor + Neutron Displacer = Overtuned Tank Armor

Improvements are as follows:

QL:200

Acually it's 48 hours which is a very long time. That'd be 8 days at playing 8 hours a day. By then you'd have probably outgrown it or found a replacement. It's a pretty good deal since the ql 200 heavy tank version gives more ac to the big 3 stats than any other back item in game.

Theres always the 4000 more BS missions option too.

Mercatura @ 10/7/2002 8:59:25 PM (57174):
Depends on what you're making, so theres no set formula.

1200 np for 200 shining nano pool chest
1000 np for 200 shining life chest
960 np for 200 shining creation head
800 np for 200 shining dodging leg
680 np for 200 shining shotgun right arm

You could always download nanonanny though  Its not perfectly accurate but its close enough where it counts.

1000 NP will let you make 99% of the implants people use. So maybe Skill/5 would give you a general idea of the ql of implants you can do complete sets at.

Skill/4.8 for everything else, since nano pool chest (skill/6) is rare, and only max life chest and martial arts right hand need skill/5.

Hmm nano nanny keeps track of almost everything in the data files. I bet someone could just edit them to include jobe and refined clusters, etc.

coldwarkid @ 10/8/2002 11:58:16 AM (56069):
CLuster QL rules are as follows: Shining clusters need to be at least 86% of the QL of the implant, rounding up. Bright clusters need to be 84% the QL. Faded clusters need only be 82% the QL.Accordingly, you should be able to use a QL68 bright cluster in a QL80 implant. If you want to be sure, buy a really low QL cluster (something like a QL4) and try to combine it. The System will tell you the minimum QL needed.

Cheers,

Khaitlene @ 10/8/2002 3:08:55 PM (56069):
I have another interesting question:

If I were to combine a QL 186 shining cluster giving +90 bonus with a QL 200 implant, will I raise the skill bonus equal to a QL 200 cluster after combining (which is +105)? I am curious because I am about to make a set of QL 200 implants and didn't want to buy too low QL of a cluster if its not going to give me the maximum bonuses.

Thanks!

Ellusion @ 10/9/2002 10:49:54 AM (53692):
The breastplate is neat, but that helmet is so butt ugly Svpernaut you should be ashamed to let someone take your picture in it =)

But seriously, it still amazes me how FC keeps reusing the old graphics for stuff people hardly ever wear (for a reason maybe?) - cool items like this should have unique looks, and it doesnt have to be more elaborate than the color tint of that breastplate (or dragon, bronto, carbonum etc)

And the Large Hard Patch doesn't drop still. Some GM's say it's in game, some say it is but doesnt drop, and some say it isn't at all. ARKS say whatever they think you'd like to hear when they don't know the answer =)

For the bronto armor guide on AA a month ago, we were contacted by a lot of people saying they had a piece - most turned out to be large soft patches, and those that still insisted they had one were unable to show it in a tell even (either patch or finnished chestpiece), with "Uhm, cant seem to find it". None that I know of have ever seen a piece.

Hopefully soon though, and hopefully also with the missing piece that goes in your back slot called "Bronto Tail", a 20m long, 5 tonne heavy real bronto mama tail you can drag along for show =)

Carbonum Armor when I have to buy the sheets: 
ql 170-200 (basically if i have to swap imps) 

1 million per armor piece 

ql 170 and under 

Tip what you want + price of sheet 

Carbonum Armor(when I dont have to buy the sheets), bronto armor, and dragon armor: 
ql 170-200 (basically if i have to swap imps) 

500k per armor piece 

ql 170 and under (this is where dragon armor fits in) 

Tip what you want 

Virral eggs: 5 million an egg 

Treatment libraries: 2 million for ql 170ish - 200 
just a tip if i dont need to swap imps 

Implant dissasembly clinics: 2 million for ql 170ish - 200 
just a tip if i dont need to swap imps 

Weapon making: 1 mill for ql 170ish-200 just a tip if i dont have to swap imps 

Discs : Can make up to ql 150ish 1 mill if i need to swap imps, elsewise for tip (I haven't stocked up on carb rocks yet so if you bring your own it would be nice) 

Wrangles, maestros: free if im not busy. 

Other: I can probably do whatever things you can think of that require chemistry, mech eng, or elec engy, wep smith just ask me in-game and we will work something out. Well that is all I can think of as of now : ) 

Note: I reserve right to change prices, so if you are low on cash I might lower price, or if I hate you I might raise it : p

Hi, I'm a tradeskilling trader on rk2(so you won't have to worry about competition from me), and I have a question.  I looked up your profile and am wondering how the heck you get all your tradeskills to such a high base without a +80 to swap imps.  I'm higher level than you and my skills aren't that high without me putting in a few imps.  Do you just leave the imps in all the time? or can you switch imps without doc buffs or what?

Elbo @ 10/9/2002 6:18:51 PM (56323):
Little bump for this.

Also my prices are pretty good on carb armor.  Charging 500K for 1 piece of armor if you buy the plates is pathetic!   Takes just 2 clicks and I'm done.  

(you know who I'm talking about)  Remember under QL100ish is free if you bring the plates and I got the time.

Now okay if it were possible to get some decent xp for tradeskills then i might not ming shelling out 100+ mil for a PPPe to make armour for people.

I have a set of QL200 tradeskilling implants in when im in "Tradeskill Mode". Those take +80 treatment to get in, but once I get em in I can swap Shining Head implants with just a treatment expertise. I also use things like bow tie, 1k borad etc. There are however 2-3 things I need outside buffs to do, but only QL190+. But still, I can do 95% of the stuff on the spot.

Svpernaut @ 10/10/2002 4:22:41 AM (53627):
the higher level armors and implants are meant for "game expansion." but the thing that funcom didn't take into consideration is that they will be bankrupt by second quarter of 2003... thanks to games like AC2 and SWG, and thanks to their stupid developers and managers.

3. Lock and Stock

Heck yeah! My engineer was about  to cry, when he build his first gun, and he was soooo happy... 'till he noticed the experience it gave him (at level 17).

Seriously, I think engineers should be able to build stuff to level up. After all... what would be the interest in playing the game as an engineer?

I am not an avid player of games. In average I play 2 per year, and that's because there's not much attraction in it. You have the shoot'em ups, which are (in my oppinion) boring and inane. You have the strategy games, which get me involved the most, but it's still gets boring after you did all the stages. I just hate games that don't require thinking in order to play it. After all, i don't want to numb my mind when i play.

Now that I found this game, it seems like the best idea ever, but it's... in my oppinion, badly conceived. Engineers fighting? Might as well use agents for healing a team...

I'm sorry, FunCom, but .... did you ever think of the ensamble of the game before you started typing the code? (....I can't wake up... seriously... ENGINEERS fighting?? They should be able to build the damn robots and sell them to other players so they can use them in battle!!)

Besides, I love the way the robot goes looking (for food?) while you push the boss button.... :S

Man are you conceited.  Until last night I didnt think you were even playing.  I was thinking of the other people who charge:

"750k per armor piece if under 5 total pieces"

for QL150-200 pieces.  They should state the limit they can go to without implants.  

Like I can go to 172-173ish unbuffed in making Carb.  Higher than that would require implant swaps so yeah I wouldnt sell for cheap.  I would stick to the general rule of thumb of 2K per QL lvl of the part for QL172-173 and under.  So instead of 3M for QL150 carb if you bring the plates (4 pieces)  it would be 1.2M  Doesnt require me to run anything but my self buffs and presto.


So..   If you want to know my pricing structure for carb armor:

2K per QL lvl of the piece up to QL172.   If I'm required to jump through some doc hoops with implant swaping yeah I'm going to charge nicely.

To buyers of armor (any type that needs to be made).  These PPPE's cost us a PILE of cash.   You should tip higher if they/we stop everything were doing to take care of your armor.  2K per QL should be consider base level.

MP is the best for making implants as they have NP buffs above expertise,  Almost any prof can build ql200 imps once they get their 1k token board if they wish

and clusters can be purchased in the tradeskills section of shops there is a terminal for each bright, shining and faded.

Hi!

I'm about lvl 33 MA and still have implants of qu 10. I found it very pleasing, that there is a shop with pre made implants for any profession. But it seems, that there is none for advanced profession specific implants. Now the fights become tougher and I should use any advantage, I can get. So, should I learn nano programming to build my own implants? 
In other MMORPGs one could really specialize on the chosen profession, because many players made a living by selling services. This seems not to be the case in this game. I never saw anybody offering his skills for making something, e.g. armor or said implants. So am I forced to spread my skill points to manufacture my own stuff?
For now it may be ok, but on the long run... I don't know.

TIA

DaveDread @ 10/12/2002 3:04:28 PM (58586):
As a MA, I warmly recommend you to let the more tradeskill-oriented professions do implants for you.

MP's and NT's are very skilled, as goes for traders and engineers. Try asking on a shopping channel "Need the services of experienced nanoprogrammer/implant maker for X implants". There are better uses for your IP then to put them into dark blue tradeskills.

Intrepid @ 10/12/2002 8:41:08 PM (58610):
only ranged weapons i know which can be improved would be the fixer chemical gun.(i don't remember the name off the top of my head though i must have made 100 by now) and the soldier hellspinner gun.  other then that i know of no guns which can be upgraded.

Garamond @ 10/12/2002 10:16:58 PM (53627):
I remember before release the devs where swearing up and down they would never up the level cap. They said the arranged it so level 200 would be extremely rare and hard to get.

- Skill: Chemistry = 4 [Enforcer] *(why doesn't this look right?)
- Skill: Breaking and Entering = 8 [Fixer]

Total Class Hits:
- Bureaucrat (2)
- Doctor (2)
- Enforcer (2)
- Engineer (4)
- Fixer (3)
- Metaphysicist (2)
- Nanotechnician (2)
- Trader (3)
- Agent (1)

My Colour Ranking System: Best --> Worst
- Green
- Turqouise
- Light Blue (more of a mid in actuality)
- Dark Blue

This data doesn't take into account each supporting tradeskills for each class. If we include those, we find the best tradeskill classes are as follows:
- Trader (4 Green, 5 Turquoise)
- Engineer (4 Green, 4 Turquoise, 1 Dark Blue)
- Fixer (1 Green, 6 Turquoise, 2 Light Blue)

If we further expand this data to include Breaking and Entering, we end up with the following:
- Trader (4 Green, 5 Turquoise, 1 Light Blue)
- Engineer (4 Green, 4 Turquoise, 1 Light Blue, 1 Dark Blue)
- Fixer (2 Green, 6 Turquoise, 2 Light Blue)

Since there are now 10 skills involved, let's assign each an arbitrary number, representing their part of the total percentage. Since there are four groupings of skills, each colour ranking shall represent a 2.5% increase in efficiency for comparative purposes. Dark Blue will begin at 2.5% instead of 0% since it is theoretically possible to raise this skill 4 points/level (1 from stats), albeit at a very high cost. This also explains why it hasn't been assigned a 6.67% rating, as the added IP cost diminishes the probabaility of said skill being raised this high.
* Green = 10%
* Turquoise = 7.5%
* Light Blue = 5%
* Dark Blue = 2.5%

- Trader: 40% + 37.5% + 5% = 82.5%
- Engineer: 40% + 30% + 5% + 2.5% = 77.5%
- Fixer: 20% + 45% + 10% = 75%

I'll include other classes for the sake of completeness.

- Doctor: 20% + 7.5% + 30% + 2.5% = 60%
- Enforcer: 20% + 7.5% + 25% + 5% = 57.5%
- Agent: 10% + 22.5% + 20% + 5% = 57.5%
- Metaphysicist: 20% + 25% + 7.5% = 52.5%
- Nanotechnician: 20% + 20% + 10% = 50%
- Adventurer: 15% + 30% + 5% = 50%
- Bureaucrat: 20% + 15% + 12.5% = 47.5%
- Soldier: 15% + 25% + 7.5% = 47.5%
- Martial Artist: 15% + 17.5% = 32.5%

OK, now lets add in a % for each time a class has a green skill equal to the number of times that skill got a hit in the item matrix above. We'll halve that for a Turquoise skill and halve it again for a Light Blue skill, with no bonus or penalty for a Dark Blue. This should increase the results with variables based on the more popular tradeskills. Integers under half a percent will be rounded up to the next half a percent (to avoid a 0.25 score for the Engineer, Agent and Adventurer for Trap Disarm)

- Trader: 82.5 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3.5 + 1.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 = 103%
- Engineer: 77.5 + 7 + 4 + 3 + 4 + 0.5 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 + 2 + 0.5 = 102%
- Fixer: 75 + 3.5 + 2 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 8 + 1 = 96%
- Doctor: 60 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 70.5%
- Enforcer: 57.5 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 70.5%
- Agent: 57.5 + 3.5 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 = 67.5%
- Adventurer: 50 + 3.5 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1 + 2 + 0.5 = 61%
- Metaphysicist: 52.5 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 2 + 1 + 0.5 + 1 = 60.5%
- Nanotechnician: 50 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 58%
- Soldier: 47.5 + 2 + 2 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 54.5%
- Bureaucrat: 47.5 + 2 + 0.5 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 54%
- Martial Artist: 32.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 2 = 35.5%

So my final verdict is that the Trader only slightly outclasses the Engineer in overall tradeskills, but the Engineer tends to have an edge on the Trader in terms of how useful her trade skills will be, even though the Trader has a slight overall bonus in terms of IP cost. The fixer is a surprisingly close third, with their Breaking and Entering skills and Turquoise tradeskills proving useful throughout.

Unsurprisingly, the Martial Artist is the poorest character type for a trade skill character and the Enforcer is a surprise show in the rankings, occupying the fourth slot alongside the Doctor. The Enforcer could be a good choice to send down the direction of Armour Construction, with the added bonus of Jewelery work using Mechanical Engineering.

Ultimately, I am very surprised with the outcomes. There is a hefty margin for error in these equations, yet it seems to me that the Trader is every bit as viable as an Engineer when it comes to tradeskills and yet is superior in combat and speed skills, with nano skills having a more even spread between Turquoise and Light Blue, without the polarised extremes the Engineer experiences with Green and Dark Blue skills. I have read that the Trader rules PvP and their buffs can make other classes green with envy. Are Engineer pets really that good, or should I reroll my Engineer into a Trader?

Also it seems to me that Fixers are certainly highly viable as tradeskill characters - but I imagine this would be an IP reallocation job as the rest of their skills seem to support the general consensus that they're IP heavy to build.

I hope you enjoyed this dissection, I apologise in advance for any errors made during it's construction and while I have attempted to give all credit where it is due, if I have omitted any source of information, it was not by design!

Guest @ 10/13/2002 3:06:50 PM (56323):
just wanted to say something


if one guy wants to charge, and another doesn't...it's THEIR own decision.

With my trader I used to wrangle for free when I thought people charged too high. However, if someone asked me to wrangle, I would demand a very high cost. Why? Cuz I didn't need the money, and it was extra work. So, when I asked people to do something for me, I tipped alot. If I built a twink and got a lower essence from a level 40, I tipped 50k. If I needed a ql 200 implants made, I used a tell (if say was ignored) and said I was offering 500k per implant. If people said no, I found another.

Was what I did right or wrong? Subjective!

If people are willing to pay 2 million for a piece of armor, let them, if someone else is willing to make it for free, let them.

It's not your business, it's theirs.

However, all respect to those that do it to be nice. And all respect to those that charge high prices just cuz they can too!

Hayjyin @ 10/13/2002 4:10:18 PM (54372):
EDIT: This post has been changed to reflect corrected math. If Kzak's following reply does not make sense, the edit is the cause.

Emergency Treatment Laboratories (ETLs), which are really the most sought-after item that Pharmacological Tech can provide (at the moment, mostly because of Restoration Stims' cost), do have their share of advantages and disadvantages.

QL 110, which is the highest I can currently build, costs approximately 245,000 credits, if I find the cheapest parts possible. Let's say I also provide the blood plasma necessary (which I do). That's 350 charges as result.

245,000 credits for 350 charges is 700 credits per charge.
A store-bought QL 110 is 14,000 credits for fifty charges, or 280 per charge. This amounts to a 250% cost increase for an approximate 266% increase in health restored.

After correcting my values, I find that this is much more reasonable than my previous 2.4 Million credits and 2500% cost increase, and quite affordable after all, if still not within my personal price range.

Kzak @ 10/13/2002 11:48:09 PM (54372):
Um, Hayjyin?

Where are you buying your components?

Me, with 760 CompLit (unbuffed), can build QL125 Emergency Treatment Laboratories for less than 350k - that's 1k per charge.
Please re-check the prices in the tradeskill vendors?

Kzak @ 10/13/2002 11:59:25 PM (58782):
Well, Traders have tradeskill buffs giving them up to +125 extra points in all major tradeskills,, effectively meaning they'll outdo an Engineer any day of the week, as Engineers don't have any such buffs with the exception of expertises and +60 to Chemistry/Pharma-tech.

The subject of tradeskills between these two classes have basically been discussed to death and beyond, so I won't bring that up here.

Hard to get?  Maybe.

Rare?  Never say "Rare" because then people WILL try to get there, and since the path to Level 200 is so obvious ("Kill stuff") Everyone who decides they want to WILL get there sooner or later.  And probably sooner.

I think they may still be scratching their heads, wondering why their highest level players aren't 150ish and running 25 percent missions.

Hayjyin @ 10/14/2002 3:55:57 AM (54372):
Kzak, not everyone has 760 Computer literacy. Mine is close to 450, which is not an unsignificant difference. Still, I went back to check the prices again, and I do, in fact, come to a much lower cost total. I seem to recall now that the 2.4 million is an older calculation of mine which I later disproved, from the time when ETLs were new. Oddly, though, through error, I came to the same amount a few days ago. I apologise for the confusion; I am, after all, a doctor, and not a mathematician.

The corrected total is approximately 245,000 credits, or 700 credits per charge, which amounts to a 250% cost increase. 

I apologise again for the confusion, and withdraw my comments.

I just made a ql109 treatment lab for 196k credits by combining the following:

ql81 serum (57809 creds)
ql90 oil (2345 creds)
ql88 monster part (free)
ql93 jar (57128 creds)
ql109 bot injector (79627 creds)

If you really spent a while shopping around you could cut even more off the price.  Its got 329 charges.  My comp lit is 527 btw.

Which works out at 598 creds per charge, which is a 213% increase in cost comparatively.

I'm not saying that pharmacy parts aren't expensive, but if you shop around they are much better than the store kits.

It seems like the only time you really need to worry about a trustworthy tradeskiller is when you're making GA, NS, or a Virral Egg. I do armor, regular implants, nanos, and other various tradeskills but I haven't really decided to go commercial yet, possibly after level 164.

I've had items disappear on me too. Made a dragon chest piece back when they were UNIQUE and since I was wering one myself it went poof (guildie, she got it back though from a GM later). 

Made lots of GAs recently. What I'm surprised about in general is that I do more business with the omni population than clan/neutral together. *shrug*

When taking into acount buffs, traders have an edge since we do not need to hunt down buffs. BUT there is ALOT more utlities/armor that increases an engy's skills, giving them the over possibility of getting higher in ANY skill bar comp lit compared to the trader.

Lirona @ 10/15/2002 5:04:15 AM (58711):
Here's an odd question about implant disassembly.

As I'm sure everyone here is aware, it is possible to "improve" the QL of an implant by adding clusters to it.  However, normally this can only be done once, and only at high levels of skill.

However, the Implant Disassembly kit presents an alternative.  If one implants junk clusters (Psychobabble implants, for instance) into an implant, then disassembles it, does the QL of the implant stay at the raised state, or does it drop back down?

In other words, could these kits theoretically allow someone who carefully hoards clusters throughout their career to keep a set of implants for longer, at a cheaper rate than would normally be required?

Are you kidding me? there are only 11, thats right, 11 engie only items. and most of those are useless weapons.   Do a search on Antiguardians for engineer only reqs  it's quite sad.

It doesn't seem right like you say probably because it isn't.  Can you link to the exact spot where you found this info because i wanna see how they came about it.

I found the page i believe you got those stats from but you seem to have forgot that the differene between Aqua and Green is only in IP costs and not in how far you can raise a certain skill.  Thus all green and aqua skills should be counted in your list but they aren't.  Using that method gives a better overall view of the tradeskill classes particulairily engineers who get 8 hits and traders who get 9 hits and fixers who get 9 hits as well.(i didn't know fixers were so good in tradeskills)  though why bomb disarm is included i don't really know so its really only 8 for fixers.

And none of your calculations here take into account who can buff what by how much.  Maybe not a problem on Rk1 but quite a serious problem on RK2 and extremely severe on RK3

AS for your question as to whether you should reroll your engie to be a trader.  As a engie who has done just that i would say if your under level 100 hell yes you should do it.  If over 100 though Its hard to make the decision because of all the time you have put into your character it mean to much lost work to start over.

wefix @ 10/15/2002 11:03:09 AM (58711):
If you remove the clusters the implants stays at the ql it was.  If you put in new ones it will go up as usual.  If you remove again, it will stay at the higher level.  Eventually you could push it to ql200.  However, implants (full or basic) are so common that this is not worth doing.  And it takes very high skills to do (NP to build and B&E to clean).  Both those skills need to be near the same level as the trreatment to wear it, so near 1000 for ql200.

Kzak @ 10/15/2002 11:35:27 AM (58782):
The only -real- Engi-only items that add any considerable amount to tradeskills would be the HUD Upgrade: Personal S.T.M. and the A-4000 NCU Sheet.

+35 and +40, respectively. And these items have to be camped for; the NCU Sheet is at an 18-hour mob, while T.I.M. is merely camped by a lot of people wanting the regular scopes.

Not a lot when compared to the +80 and +125 for Journeyman and Maestro buffs. If an Engineer is superior to a Trader by wearing the two items mentioned above, the Trader is -definetly- doing something wrong.

Kzak @ 10/15/2002 11:45:02 AM (59186):
Wire Drawing Machine: Don't know. But buy a QL1 one, try to combine with a QL50 spool of thread to find out, multiply as needed for Ql200+.

Bio-Communitor: The higher the QL of the communitor, the more the QL of the monster-parts will be 'pulled up' towards the QL of the communitor. Buy a QL200 if you can afford it.

Jensen Personal Ore Extractor: QL70 should be enough for your needs. The Ore Extractor can be used upon ore up to 4 times its QL.

others are going to take psycology (the all acs one for sure).

Intrepid @ 10/15/2002 4:00:17 PM (58782):
the new engie only armour is nice.  Adds 20 to main tradeskills 10 to secondairy ones.  If your willing to take the hit in ACs/HP/NCU/nano init or whatever armour you are using.

If those custom rings of tinkering ever came out then those would be a must for any engie tradeskiller to have a pair of.

Lirona @ 10/15/2002 4:25:50 PM (58711):
I didn't think it would really be practical.  I just think it would be cool.

"I've been using these same implants since I was fighting off Rookies.  They don't need replacements, just give'em a tuneup every once in awhile and they work better than ever."

Garishna @ 10/15/2002 5:09:32 PM (Improving weapons.... 59405):
I have a question about the improving weapons abilities of the MRR.
I use Slankchops as an enforcer and I'm wondering if there is anyone out there with a MRR and the improve piercing weapons disk that would be willing to preform this on one of my older weapons as a test.  I would be willing to tip and you would have repeat business if the process preforms favorably 

If you can do this procedure, please contact me ingame with a /tell or post here in this thread.

I look forward to a reply from someone.

If nobody has the tools or disk, please post here with the items I'll need to preform so that I may track them down.

Thanks bunches!!

Mercatura @ 10/15/2002 6:01:07 PM (58782):
You don't need AC when you're using tradeskills.

Besides, for any highend work you have to implant swap.

FC seems to want people to have to do things together, and doesn't care how rare an item is as long as its out there.

steel @ 10/16/2002 12:06:52 AM (58782):
Hi everyone, thanks for all the feedback - especially the constructive comments a couple of you have made to query my original post.

The reason that post came about is that I decided I wanted a character to do tradeskills. Why? Well, in other games I've enjoyed the satisfaction of a job well done, and I felt it could add an extra dimension to my game 

So I accumlated all of that data and wrote it into notepad. (Slow day at work, one of the horror/benefits of having a reactive job is that every now and then... like Sunday nights... there's no work to be done). After I'd finalised it, I thought maybe others could benefit from it, so I added in the links.

As to the question, where did I get the skill matrix? Here is the full URL: http://aovault.ign.com/thegame/skills/

Also, I didn't realise that a green or turquoise skill can both be raised an equal number of points per level (albeit at differing IP costs), so my results have to be taken with a hefty grain of salt from there.

I deliberately left out the possibility of buffs for two reasons.
1) I don't know the end-game buffs for high levels
2) You cannot rely on them - you may not always be able to get said buff unless you can cast it yourself.

With regards to Bomb/Disarm as a tradeskill, I got my information from Anarchyarcanum for their coffee machine. Apparently a skill of 200 is required to reshape the container. Maybe this is a typographical error and should be Breaking and Entering?

With reference to a sticky... I don't think this post deserves one (but thanks for the vote of confidence). For one, I'm not an established and experienced tradesperson, secondly all I did was collate some data and throw in some variables of my own. I didn't even build the variables in a consistent manner, I simply picked ones that seemed plausible and ran with the ball.

Ultimately, I have decided to start a fixer and see how they work with Tradeskills. I realise they'll be heavily dependent on buffs from other players, but I think I can live with that. The speed demon in me is just itching to try it out. So I have made a solitus fixer, who works for Omni. Why Solitus? Why Omni? Because I *love* the look of omni-pol armour (and all my other characters are neutral so no hope of wearing it for them) and as far as I'm aware, that armour is based on Str/Sta (the mere thought of Dark Blue nano skills combined with Dark blue nano-controlling attributes for an Atrox made me quiver with fear, so I went for the next best thing  ).  This should be interesting...

If you are part of a uber org who has the luxury of being able to put 3 full team together to go kill "the one" 2 or more times for you then yes i guess your would be correct.  But thats like saying all NTs should have gaily hood and stuff like that.  Yes possible not probable.  Not to mention as soon as 14.6 comes out traders have the exact same buffs on a set of armour themselves.

and at what point does being able to get that extra 10 skill outweigh the ability to get 125 instantly or have to slum around for it?

locomdenom @ 10/16/2002 1:19:14 AM (58782):
For what it's worth, as a fixer you probably won't have the extra IP for tradeskilling until 150+.

Well, I finally got a hold of my first disassembler. Yay! So I went to take apart some implants I had lying around...and my B&E skill wasn't high enough. Fair enough, so I start plopping points into B&E...and I go, "Wait a minute!" And I look at the other skills I'm working on, mechanical engineering, weapon smithing, and I realize it may be fun to diversify, but I'm already out half the nanos that other traders are enjoying just because I'm fiddling around with other skills.

And I agree, Lirona. "Because it's cool" is a very good reason, especially when you're playing a game.

The Team Beacon Warp nano was always called just "Beacon Warp". Not a very bad bug though, since it says in desription that it warps the team and the skills are different from the regular one. Its merely the name thats wrong, bugreported way way back. Kinda tells you how high priority this has with the devs

Octo @ 10/16/2002 3:29:35 PM (57140):
But since this is a bug in our favour, do they consider it to be an exploit to wear the armor for longer than 48 hours?

You get someone to make it into a bronto armor piece.

Mercatura @ 10/16/2002 7:46:33 PM (58782):
If you can't get the buffs, thats your problem.

You are reading more than I said.

FC doesn't care if something is rare, just if its there or not. I walk by a particular engy in the new armor at trade bank all the time. Its there. At least its not on some lame 18 hour mob you have to KS for, its something you assemble a team to get.

Then again, if you can't find a buff you probably have trouble finding people to help you.

The point when it outweighs it is when a title capped trader can't make it but a title capped engy can.

I could care less if engineers get a buff, as long as it is not self-only. Anything else is a long, clever little way to get traders nerfed and appease another set of whiners.

Engys are still ahead with the new items.

BTW, it doesn't take an uber org to do everything.

The protection covers all ACs at equal levels, it looks good, and..

It drops off of tarasque, and a full set is worth pretty much 1 billion credits.

And the normal wo/man is left with the pretty bad looking Carbonum, however good it may be (except energy ac).

The only commonly available more-special-than-metaplast armour piece I think looks very good is the Nomad Jubilee Chestpiece, and that looks the same as reg. Nomad right?

If only all armour could look as thorougly good as Omni-pol and its black brother.

It gives a big nano pool increase.  But, ya need a special item to make it into armor.  We've been trying for months to get one for ourselves.  But, the prices on the forums are ridiculous and we've had no luck with our lowbies running continuous lvl60 team missions.

It's not worth throwing in the trash, however.  Hang on to it or give it to Bigguy for when he finally finds his PPPE: Shape Soft Armor.

I'm new, so what do I know, but....

I started my char as a trader because I thought this was a ROLEPLAYING GAME. I assumed that "trader" equals "make your living selling/transporting/making stuff"--i.e., through trade. But from what I see here, you can't make much of anything, and what you can make you have to wait to make until you're high level. So I'm a "trader" who runs around killing stuff. Ohhhhkay.... And from what I see so far in the game, there's no real roleplaying aspect to selling stuff, either. Just spam away on the appropriate channel--no stores, no personal vending machines, not even something like a trade blanket that you can sit down and set up in a market or anything. Why have this class/tradeskills at all? 

It sounds good but you can't do much, apparently. I've tried to make stuff after checking out websites and I STILL can't get anything to work. This always means that I blow my hard-earned credits on useless parts. I can't believe that this was meant to work this way.

Prices reduced and now can do up to ql 170 self buffed. Also changed it to anything 170 and under I don't set a price for, just tip me what you can afford/think is right. If I'm in a good mode I might perform my trader roleplaying act for you ; ).

IMO way too high. I can understand that many armorcrafters wants to make up for their investment in the pppe (around 50-60m), but charging 1.5k per ql for lowbie qls is.... well... "not nice" (I would want to use more harsh words, but then again, im a nice guy ;P )

Anyway.... I make all types of armor, and I set the price individually when I see the char that orders the money, talk to him abit and such. For a sub ql50 I have never ever charged more than 100k for a FULL set. Lately though Ive been doing them for 100k since it takes some time to do it though. Seems kinda outragous that this guy actually charged 72k per part. Thats 504k for a ql48 set. Get real!

For higher QLs the prices increase though..... but nowhere near 1.5k per ql. Im less online now than I used to, but see if Im online sometime and Ill make you a cheap set if you bring plates.

*EDIT*: Now, Im sure there are several armorcrafters that will flame this now. So lets just say it for the record: You are free to charge whatever you want to charge. Noone will dictate what you should charge.
I just posted this so that it would be possible for the real n00bs to get this armor also, and asking you to be nice to them. Remember that we where all n00bs once (Though we never had any armor this good)

Not really.

At level 191 i will be able to self swap all my implants.  If i was nanomage i could have been doing that around level 165.  As it is a solitus i am 1 treatment point away after twinking to be able to do it.  So either when i get to 190 and can raise treatment or i get a virral egg or 2 i will be able to do it on my own./

As a engie doing tradeskills means having a trader stapled to my ass all day long.

And yes it does mean i am not wearing ql200 armour.  I only use armour which i can self equip so that swaping armour for medsuit to be able to swap implants is not a problem.

Corona MK armor is very good, IMO and it looks damn good, too, especially the MKII hood.

Another good piece of armor is So8 (very common in boss loot), and it's a prettier sight than Carbo. As for me, you won't see me wearing carbo and looking like a clown, despite it's good stats.

The armor I had made was for a level 40 toon. The carbonum plating was QL 48 and cost about 100k for each piece. If I couldn't bring myself to buy more than 3 pieces because of the high price of carbonum, what makes you think a 'real n00b' will even bring himself to buy one piece when their nanos are starting to cost that much in stores? Granted that nanos can be purchased from other people cheaper or found in missions, but there is only one source of carbonum plating.

Elbo @ 10/18/2002 4:04:20 PM (56323):
Perhaps I missed the point of your message?  

Your saying you raped people on the prices until you got your uber item?  or was it to hijack my thread saying your lowering your prices? or was it to brag about the fact you make more money now in tips than when you just stated pricing.

Do I come into your posts and do that sort of thing?

Trader Doug @ 10/18/2002 5:16:17 PM (56323):
The point of my message was to address your complaint against my services, and my prices were hardly "raping" people in the first place.  Oh and yes you do and come post these types of things in my posts elbo.

It's pretty obvious you meant me there.  There is what 5 of us on rk2 who can make ql 200 armor?  Maybe 3 at most that actually have our prices listed in posts(that I've seen).  Strange how that is *exactly* how my price listing was worded(yes I have my old one saved in notepad) and im 99% sure that I'm the only person who has listed prices that did the thing "for over 5 pieces" and "for under 5 pieces".  And why do you keep saying I have problems?  I don't call you names, I don't attack you in threads.  So far I have been gracious to your requests.  You called my signature "racist" so I changed it for you.  You called my pricing "pathetic" I've lowered my prices for you.  You told me to stay away from you, and so far I haven't seen you in game yet, that I know of, maybe you see me run by on way to tir arena, I dunno.  You have blatently posted stuff in my tradeskill thread about how I can't make certain things(even though I could) and that they should come see you instead because you can.  It's not like I posted here saying that I'm a way better tradeskiller than you and that everyone should come see me instead of you.  In fact I reccomend all clanners to go to elbo, It's probably more convenient for you and I like his virral egg swap idea.  This is the only time I've ever posted in one of your threads and that is just because you are attacking me in it.  And to intrepid, I don't even know your ingame name(mighta read it somewhere, skips my mind atm) so I don't think we can have any problems yet ; ) and I stay in nlc, only go to tir for the arena.

Mercatura @ 10/19/2002 6:10:56 PM (45489):
That site rates uncommon ACs "equal" to regular ACs. Its a nice stats list, but not as material to what you want ingame. It ends up giving obtru a higher total stat than flowers, but obtru has low melee (ow), where flowers has low poison (who cares).

PvM is pretty simple, and nearly universal with missions and most camps. Some camps will favor one of the big 3 over the other 2.

-Most common: Projectile
-Close second: Melee (tend to hit harder too, I would rate it equal to proj due to this, less likely to be minimum dmg)
-Strong third: Chemical
-Weak Fourth: Energy (mainly at lower levels with bots)
-Everything else: 50 times rarer and only on bosses, a few dungeon mobs, some rare outdoor mobs and occasionally MA mobs. Nanos have such high minimum damage it hardly matters what they hit with.

Anything that is low in the first 3 is a substandard choice for PvM if you have a choice.

PvP is a little different, but half damage tends to favor weapons can hit hard. Everything else ends up minimum or a crit. Crits don't ignore AC, but are so big (or capped) that AC can't help as much.

I'm no expert at PvP by far, but you can look a the weapons around and get a feel. Energy, melee and proj are very common, and Chem (MCS, MA) Fire (Adv, MA) and recently Rad (Sold) show up frequently. Cold and Poison are rare and don't do much damage. Nanos again have such high minimums it won't matter as much.

PvP makes things like Decaniums + RRFE more effective than most armors, esp for non healers. (nearly 1000 extra life + half damage + 30% reduced is like getting 2500 life in pvm, even better if you have HoTs and heals) It also has its lower ACs in the least common areas.

Dragon can be OE'd to hell and back if you're not a MA user. (personally I hope to drain first) Only the body gets better ACs, the rest is less per AC than some type of regular ql200 armor. Body, legs and circlet give good bonuses, the rest are almost pointless to everyone but some MAs. Looks nice though

Bima @ 10/19/2002 6:43:09 PM (45489):
All good comments, Mercatura.  I only want to point out a couple of things in addition.

The table doesn't rate the armour for any particular purpose, just ranks them in order of their combined overall armour protection. This does separate the fairly good suits from the fairly lousy ones, but within a narrower range there are choices to be made. The best armour for any given circumstance will certainly vary.

The other thing I wanted to say is that you don't need the most uber armour to do well in this game, at least PvM.  You can advance quite well in less than uber armour.  If that were not true everyone you saw 100+ would be wearing the exact same thing, and that just isn't the case.

Tza @ 10/19/2002 7:14:31 PM (57821):
Does that mean, that if I buy a set of Carb armour, I can finally get your box0rs?

DocSmock @ 10/19/2002 8:25:02 PM (45489):
Scumbug, Anarchyarcanum claims Large Hard is available as chest loot only.  True or not, I have no idea.

(Edit: Just caught Ellusion's post on different thread, was saying it's not dropping.  oops.)

On the subject of Bronto hides, what is the going rate/QL?  
I had QL18 soft and was offered 10k for it.  Accepted because it was more than I was expecting and am not going to gouge on price.  But would still like to know how much should ask as I don't want to be on the receiving end of a gouging.

On tradeskill items in general, what QL should I start collecting for sale?  No point in collecting QL15 if no one is using less than QL30.

Mercatura @ 10/20/2002 12:43:15 AM (45489):
Everyone 150+ is wearing the "exact" same thing 

Decraniums + Albrecht with a smattering of Dragon/So8/Carbonum + MA suits/Padded Coat/Web Cloak.

My real question is is the PPE a tool ?  or will it be consumed after I program my robot and I'll have to find a new one when I am ready to craft higher QL armor thus needing to program a higher QL robot ?  

I would hate to have to wait till lvl 150 to be able to start crafting armor, cause let's face it, I'll probably never get there.  

anyone can clarify this for me ?

I see what the problem is.  You don't have the base skills to make this.  I had misread this to be you didnt have the skills (which is the case really).  I missed the part about you needing a doc buff to swap implants.


Now.. will you stop harassing me in my own tradeskills topic.    Your wrong here and your wrong yet again in your continued argumentative behavior your towards me.

Just go away and have a nice life somewhere away from me.  I will not tolerate another negative comment towards me or your interrupting my tradeskills posts.

I got a message from this person. I told him to see a crat since psychology is the 1 thing that engineers have in dark blue.  Perhaps when I hit 200 I'll blow the IP and max that out.  I'm sure it will be a real pig.

I belive bettylu could make this for whoever needs it.  She is a pretty nice person.  Just havent seen her around (lvl 200 crat).

Drop her a message and bring some implants.  I'm sure she doesnt have them handy for just psy.

Marlark @ 10/21/2002 3:09:09 PM (58972):
Hello everyone

Informing on my strange tradeskil inteligence. Well as many have figured out on RK2 and well to my somewhat own fault is that i have alot of trade skils i can do. Only problem is that it have made me the slowest lvl:er on RK2. I would have been lvl 200 a long long time ago if i didnt take so much on me 

Never the less this is the skils i do :

ME
EE
QFT
WeapSmt
NP
Complit
Chem
Tut

Basecly the only 2 trade skil skills i do not do is Psy and Pharma tech.

All of the above skils are caped to the limit atm exept NP that is as high as needed for making ql 200 imps and well i bel they will stay that way.

Basecly i read the Adv description to much as the Jack of all trades type of char. To bad not more adv's did this. 

I can dissasemble implants not as far up as ql 200 yet but im working on that and well i can make both hard and soft armor types improve weapons make ql 200 chem mausers. Virral egg's and well on and on and on   When it come down to it i can do almost everything exept the 2 skils that im not doing 

*waves* to the trade skilling adv's stil wondering where you all are

PS The day i c Kaiusama make a virral egg is the day i own him in a arena fight DS.   wow im safe, aint going to happen!!!!!

Are you bragging in this message about your base EE or the fact you can do QL200 (disassembly units?)  Or the fact you can just swap your implants in and out...

Don't bother answering just go away.  I'm sure thats pretty clear.

I guess its time to hound your posts.  Enjoy!

Er.. leveling makes the game, fun.   You get more thingies that way too!  

As for your choice in armor lets put it this way:

Engineers DONT NEED NANO POINTS.  Thank you.  Wll we have is single cast buffs and all the bot heals are pretty much pointless after a while, too slow and drain too much.

Think you don't need mochams?  I guess you must be under level 50 still.  On the 75-100 climb you watch that self created bot go from orange to yellow to green to grey very fast.  With all your stats maxed and Q 125 imps you will have a light orange/yellow bot at 100.   And ya know what, it doesn't go back up to orange until lvl 120.   Like to just screw around?  hey thats great that bot is permanant.  You keep it til it dies or you log so why the hell not get a big bad one.

Elbo @ 10/22/2002 1:34:54 PM (58711):
I've been thinking about this.  I collect a pile of 'junk' implants with things in it that are around QL193.  Clean it.  Pop a faded (5K) cluster in to raise the QL of the implant to 195.  Clean it pop 1 more in for good measure and your at 197.    So you have taken a QL193 implant and moved it up to 197 which will be 200 when I'm done with it.    On average I raise implants by 2 quality levels.


You could really put these items on sale also with an additional 2 5K clusters.  Converting something that you would get around 30K for if you sold it to 400K if you spent the time stripping and reimplanting faded twice into it.

Cash cow by all means.

Specialone @ 10/22/2002 3:07:28 PM (60720):

I hope its a bug!  Without looking I would only guess that Crats and perhaps agents would be the only ones who don't have a dark blue bar.    Getting one of those to invest 400-500K in IP in that skill would be hard.

Yup, those pesky ql193 plants finally have a use now. I have even upgraded plants as low as 180 just becuase i was desperate and it was all i could find that min. 

Faded clusters are relatively cheap and I actually tend to get 3 levels per cluster, although it has occasionally been 2. My NP is just 1k, probably the same as you Elbo, so it might just be cluster/plant specific.

Great poll, I hope they add more to the trade skills.

I just started trying out trade skills on my lvl 51 eng.  After spending an hour, going around finding crystals and parts for nano-crystals, and parts for weapons, I was down 20-30k credits, with only 5k experience.  

Just after that, I went on a mission, and within an hour, I was up 50k credits and 120k experience.

I know that the main point of this game is fighting, but as a RL engineer, building stuff gives experience too.  I should be able to get similar experience to fighting by utilizing my trade skills, and should be able to build stuff thats WORTH something.

Hrm, Blizzaro had an imp he wanted to be put together - the req you say? 1155 Psycology.

Cz Please tell me this is will be lowered.  This is such a joke. This is litterally IMPOSSIBLE to obtain. Heres teh math bro adding in EVERYTHING there is:

677ish base(725 for a lvl 200, 677 Pre-title6) +210(full Implants) + (20 Gen) + 40(2x ql 200 OT rings) +50(Crat Buff) + 50(Tutoring) + 20 (Albrecht ql200) + 10(OT-Windchaser M06 Emerald ql38) = 

lvl180-189 =     1077
lvl200 =            1117

Cmon Now Cz, This is a litterally impossible requirment. I dont think we should have to be lvl 200 to make an imp(and even at 200 you cant with this imp). This math right here is litterally pulling out ALL the stops, the combinations of items shown above is WAY ABOVE and BEYOND what we should have to obtain to make anything, and it still doesn't get us to the requirment of the cluster!

I can probably get some extra points if i tried, alot more if i wasnt too damn lazy to make tradeskill implants 

I work mostly for tips

Kryos @ 10/23/2002 10:50:03 AM (61667):
1st what breed  and profession is that calculated for ?
2nd You've have left out following rare items


Twelve-Fingered Graspers of Ljotur (new item in 14.5, dunno where it drops) +12 to Psychology

Raising it to 1129 points

More imporant if you are a soldier

Q200 MTI Martins Simple +32 (+22 more than the emerald)

Raising the Psychology to 1151 point

and Poetic Stretch-band ( tjeck on exhange shows they drop in the range of +18 to +28)

In the end will the skill be raised to 1179.

also keep in mind that CHS add 20 to psychology
------
In reality is the stretch band properly the only item you can get hands on ( I know there are around 4-5 Martins in the game, but i doubt the owners can be persuded to sell (can maybee be persuaded to raise their Psychology for the right price ))

So if you are a soldier then can you add from +18 to +50 more to your Psychology skill than listed above. +28 to +38 if the soldier are using a CHS.

lvl 180-189 =  1095-1127 (1105-1115 with CHS setup)
Lvl 200       =  1135-1167 (1145-1155 with CHS setup)
------
Conclusion: Not impossible but goddam hard. I think a Lvl 200 soldier with the right INT/SEN implant and armor setup can reach 1155 in Psychology. I then just don't know if it are worth it.

Animoy @ 10/23/2002 12:08:39 PM (60720):

Skills listed above bro were based on trader/engie.
A soldier on the other hand may have greed psycho but their max is 50 points less then that of a trader/engie -
So your points are

lvl 180-189 = 1045-1097 (1105-1115 with CHS setup) 
Lvl 200 = 1085-1117 

As I said, Impossible, and as I also said all these items is going above an beyond whut you should have to do to make an implant - and that doesnt even give us the ability

Kryos @ 10/24/2002 6:36:16 AM (61667):
Yes they do with Crat suit and Rasch crystal will they be able to boost their Psychology +26 more then Quadmander have calculated.

Raising skill to 1141 at lvl 200

still 14 point short, i doubt a Nanomage crat will be able to boost their skill to 1155 on INT/SEN buff and items, without the Twelve-Fingers i mentioned earlier.

But try ask Marterialgirl or Whites

(Note: Omni/clan crat suit Q80 also adds +16 INT/SEN which i havn't put into my calculations. But if a Bureacrat can't raise his skill enuff to make the item, i don't know who should be able. Psychology is a Bureacrats main tradeskill even though it has a very limited use (Funcom wake up fix that broken skill))

Yes maybe a crat could=D But the fact still remains that this is WAY to difficult to perform, bordering on IMPOSSIBLE, and should not be a class restricted trade skills item *cough*
And on top of that how many level 200 nano mage crats do you know who have maxed psycho? Tutoring also?(MAYBE 2 if we are lucky) o and melee energy? Most likley none. Plus might also requir Shades of Luc and a vt egg or two. And you would also need a Pioneer Backpack. And worst of all this is a Bright cluster, jeez what doesn shiny req?

There is a nice list drawn up in the tradeskill forum for people on RK1 and what they can build.

Only one i think that have VT eggs, Shade of Lub, Professor Jones vest (Adds to Int) is Materialgirl. I'm quite sure she have maxed Psychology. (Simply something most crats do in the wage hope, that one day it will be to more use than to boost our Charm-Attack skill). Now for Tutoring that quite different sake. 

But now you say it is for the Bright cluster that makes things much worser. Don't think that any1 ever will be able to make them. But we the rate FC fix bugs in this game, theres no chance it ever will be.

NOTE: I don't find it wrong to limit a single tradeskill or the like to a single profession/breed. Right now do trader/engy have monopoly on tradeskills, you just jealous we come an take something from you

Kryos @ 10/25/2002 12:00:19 AM (61667):
Ohh i also forgot to mention, i'm started to collect implnat and other stuff, just to se how high i can boost my Psychology. Have it maxed allready, got following items

Shades of lub
2x VT egg
Q80 Omni Suit
2x Q200 OT rings

Need

Rasch Crystal Q200
Rasch Crystal Q50-75 (Dunno how high i can raise my dual wield, without using IPs))
Jones vest (Can probely borrow one that adds +17 INT)
22mill XP (So i can become lvl 180)
Psychology/Int/sen implant (Working hard on that)
Melee ener/1HB/ Multi melee implants (Working on that, so i can take on the Rasch)
Some one to "teach" me psychology
Items/armor that adds to Sense and Inteligence

Ya know Quadmander i find this a funny mission to do.

Quamander @ 10/25/2002 2:33:05 AM (61667):
Pretty sure you gonna need 195 atleast, o and btw tutor is self only - so have fun wasting ip, same with melee energy.=D 
And I do find it wrong to restrict IMPLANT making to a particular class. EXCUSE ME but traders/engie have a monopoly on most trade skills for a reason, we are a TRADESKILL based classes, engies should get engie only trade skill abilities WAY before crats. Last time I checked a crat wasn't a tradeskill oriented class, nor sol, nor enf, nor fixer, ECT. I maxed every trade skill in my window for a reason, and you think crats should get crat only items then you need to also slap a 900me + 900 pharma req on it or something so you pay the same price we do in becoming trade skill artist - we lose ALOT of ip, i shouldn't have 400 evades/30 nano resist etc etc and not be able to do major things.


And what in your right mind makes you think a crat should have class only trade skill items? EXPECIALLY IMPLANTS. 
Engies/traders/fixers dont have particular class only specialties only they can perform. B&e may be costly but its possible to do without a fixer.
While we are at it, this is not only restricting it to a particular breed of a particular class, but also to a particular UBER player who hasover 400m worth the items equiped.

And no im not flamming crats=p im flaming u kry

And im pretty sure material has yet to max tutor, much less raise melee energy - there are alot of other skills to be raised.

Basically the work of an average low level flamer, stating a point that is totally unfounded and not backed up with a SINGLE fact. 
So uh.....

Tryk @ 10/25/2002 8:36:56 PM (54917):
And why should any engineer be fighting, anyway? Or trader? Or fixer? Seriously, at the moment, I'm a level 47 agent, and I'm BORED of all the missions. There's nothing special about this game in my oppinion (exagerated, of course, for the purpose of my message). I go in, buff, pull a monster (or all of them :P) kill them, or get killed... go through all the rooms.... eradicate everyone... go to boss, kill boss, loot, open chests. Someone mentioned earlier in this thread "I thought this was a roleplaying game"? What's the fun of my engineer beying able to build a nano crystal, also available in shop, for a few k more than its original price? Or a gun that (again) costs a lot more than if you buy it from the terminal? What's the fun for a trader if they can't make their life with trading? What's the fun for a fixer not to be able to fix a "damaged pistol" or something similar?

I'm quite a newbie (well... more or less now), and Agent appealed to me - my main. I met an engineer and he build a rifle for me, and that was a really cool thing to do, so I made an engineer too. I've abandoned him at level 25, unable to make the money from items, selling and stuff.

Personally, I'd love to see an engineer build stuff, give them to a trader who'd sell them, and both get xp. That, I see as Team work.

An engineer that fights? That's a bit... strange (if not stupid, in my oppinion).

FunCom, please! Listen to this, and let us roleplay a bit. Let us play an engineer (and a trader, and a fixer, and an adventurer, and all the other classes in the game) as we SHOULD be playing them: Engineers make wow stuff. Fixers fix them. Traders sell them. Adventures go exploring and make maps, which they can sell to the traders, and those maps take less Map Navigation points to be uploaded. Agents can switch sides without that very rare item that lets you keep the tokens (ok, maybe I'm pushing it here, tap me on the shoulder if I do); or they would be able to hide their names wearing a device or something... Actually that gives me the idea of missinformation: wearing a device makes you appear as clan, when you're omni or neutral, or something (at LEAST to the other people). Soldiers would do whatever they do best. Enforcers will be able to go after the people who stole a trader's money or cheated them somehow. I pass on the other professions, but I'm sure there can be a zillion things to be said about each of them.

And please keep in mind the newbies! I don't have high level friends to help me out. When I ask for a loan (and mean it) people think I'm begging and they send me to hell and back a few times.

Customers are waited on in a First Come First Serve manner. Most customers are helped and on their way in less then 10 minutes, the better you are prepared (ex. having all the needed parts) the faster you will be on your way happily. 

If you send me a /tell and i don't answer right away or am offline please feel free to send me another /tell a few minutes later. I get many /tells at a time and can get swamped but I will do my best to maintain organization. Also, I do have quite a few alts that I play so you might want to send them /tells also (Svpernaut, Svperstar, Svperhot, Svpergod, Svperman, Svperhate, & Svperfreak).

If you send me a /tell and I am AFK I will do my best to get back to you (if it's still in the chat window) but if I am afk usually just try me a bit later (15-20mins usually). I have a pretty wide hour range that I am usually logged in and playing and I'm sure at one time or another you've seen me spamming the Omni Shopping Channels if you are ever in OT.

PLEASE NOTICE that I WILL NOT go out of my way to make low ql sets of armor (ie Leave Missions/Teams), as I don't make much off of them, and it is basically a waste of my time. So if I'm at a Camelot raid and you get aggitated because I don't have time to make you a ql2 set of Carbonum armor, try seeing it from my point of view. Also, prepared and repeat customers will be waited on faster!!! Time is money, and if you can save me 5 minutes, that is 5 minutes more I can be teaming or helping other customers.

If you have questions about what you need to complete an item instead of asking me first feel free to look at this great website : www.anarchyarcanum.com it's currently where I get all my info and you will probablly get a faster response from it then me, as "Ready" customers come before "Browsing" customers. Once again this helps speed up the process so you and I are both on our ways quicker. I will do my best to answer your questions but please for times sake if you can check the website(s) first it would be much appreciated.

I am a very Trustworthy person who is fairly well know and I'd love to help you. I have created many expensive nanos and items for satisfied customers like Grid Armors, Nullities, Dragon Armors, and Team Beacon Warp. I'm a Vetern of the great and well respected guild HYDRA, and I am proud to represent them and will do my best to please everyone I work with.

Well, that about wraps it up... if you have any questions, comments, praises or complaints please feel free to either post them here or send an ingame /tell to Svpernaut.

See Ya On RK1,
Svpernaut

Any help would be great or a good site that describes how..

Quamander @ 10/28/2002 4:29:15 AM (63021):
? =] To make a crystal you:

1. 
 - Take the Instruction Disc and combine it with the apropriate Library(found in nano crystal components section of trade skill shops)
 - Take the newly formed item and combine it with a Photon Particle Emitter. (Same location as other component)


2.
 - Take a Carbon Rock and use a Jensen Extractor on it.
 - Take a isotope seperator and use it in the Carbon Rich Ore.
 - Take a Neutrol Displacer and use it on the Carbon Crystal.
 - Take the Pre-Programed Crystal and combine it with the apropriate Crystal Reflection patter.(Find it in same place as other components)
 
3. Combine your two items.

To combine these items it reqs about the same skill in:

Comp Lit
Nano Programing
Quantum Phys
Mechanical Eng
Electrical Eng

About 900 in each skill is required to make a ql 185 nano.

they drop off of ANY mobs in the ql60ish range, so it can be a bit higher, or a bit lower. many people have had success doing ql58 or so team missions and found them on the bosses. but, just like GA, theoretically it drops off of any ql60ish mob.

- Wich Quality MRR should i buy to make Q200 ? and of course thinking on making the new ones that will appear later in the game so its q200+ Armor.

- Will the quality of the MRR increase the skills necessary to make a armor piece ?

Any info is welcome but please be acurate and shure 

I've read www.anarchyarcanum.com and i got some info on the MRR with Shape Soft Armor but i need to know for sure.

I got one of these 3 days ago from the boss in a QL 58 mission. Just got another one fifteen minutes ago from the boss in a QL 56 mission - however, the slider was set between difficulties, and was rolled this time by a 75 enforcer... was midway between 56 and the next difficulty up (61 I believe).

BTW - the boss looked the same both times...

ql60 will make ql200 armour for sure 100%.  Usually the process increases the ql by 2 and is dependant on your skills and not of the QL of the MMR and PPPE

Dimmufodr @ 10/30/2002 7:48:43 AM (61667):
Nano Agent/Opifex agent

723/721 base skill
+ 228 from ql200 implants set up like this:
Eye    S: Tutoring B: Intell F: Psychology
Head  S: Psychology B: none F: Tutoring
Ear     S: None  B:Psychology F: Intell
Chest S: Sense B: None : F: None
Waist S: None B: Sense F: None

Now you get 951 in psycology skill and 887 in tutoring if skill is maxed.

+ 20 from ql200 albrecht tank
+ 32 from Rasch Crystall (easily drained on in fp:trader ->fp:crat)
+ 40 from 2x OT rings
+ 5 from Enhanced Senses, Sense Boost and Inteligence boost
+ 4 from 2x VT eggs
+ 6? from odin's missing eye (not sure how much dribble down you'll get from this, so it's just a guess)
+ 3 from 4 (or more) pieces of nova dillon armor
+ 50 from Authority Figure
+ 20 from exp
+ 40 from ql180 Tutoring device - the ql you'd be able to use with 907 in tutoring skill

So for an Nano Mage/Opifex agent maximum psychology skill would be:

1171/1169

More than enough 

Both Nano Mage/Opifex Agents and Bureacrats can do this I think, not sure about soldiers or other classes.

Beautyfarm @ 10/30/2002 8:54:50 AM (63207):
i'v only heard hem drop from bosses yet, not normal mobs. since the boss is usually a few lvls higher then the mission ql, missions in the 50ish range probably give the best chance to get a pppe.

Svpernaut @ 10/30/2002 11:17:11 AM (63207):
the person i bought my PPPE off of way back in the day found it on a regular mob... not boss. but, since bosses drop a lot of loot, they also tend to drop better loot... at lower levels at least when you don't get 20 kin of tarasque disks.

Great concept...horrible execution.

Made my first tradeskill item last night and i have to say there was a certain satisfaction to it when the whole thing came together. It took me about 20k credits and an hour and i received maybe 1500 xp. It may be unfair to judge (Im only level 30, building an emergency treatment kit) but it seems that tradeskills, at any level, have a very disporportionate cost/benefit ratio.

the main problem i see:
Tradeskills require lots of IP and credits and yeilds almost no XP or credits. Using tradeskills should be a valid way to gain levels and credits. If someone wants to create a toon and do only trade skills, they should be able to gain levels and credits without fighting. This would open up an entirely different way to play the game at any level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Easy win for funcom-increase the XP gained (alot) and reduce the price of tradeskill items in shops. you should be able to gain xp as fast as you can in a solo mission (and yes this should include the time spent running around collecting the needed parts)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of course with quite a bit more work, tradeskills have HUGE potential to make AO more fun for all profs. there are so many great ideas on these boards for new tradeskills from the ability to upgrade more of the exisiting weak and unused weapons (insteading of introducing more uber, never drop, or camp only items) to brand new trade skills that dont exist yet (loved the idea for adventurer produced maps...or imagine map upgrades that let you mark things like elevators indoors or other places of interest out) many of the things that need to be improved could be done so through tradeskills.

imagine how much tradeskills could enhance the community way beyond the usual Lvl xx, UberDamagedealer lfg!

Dunno why they didn't give some of the low level "arkish" stuff to crats, or at least let them do it too.

Want to change your first/last name? See a crat with X psychology. Fc could add some kind of quest and incorporate how the crat has to learn their naming policies etc before they are allowed to do it.

Want to get married? same.

Want to attach an id form to some item? (e.g. make it nodrop or put your name on it) get a crat to make the form for you.

Want to form an org? need a crat to fill out the paperwork. The leader of the team then uses it.

Want to align your org with one of the RP depts of OT/clan? see a crat.

Want to hold certain kinds of events etc? crats have extra things they can do to help the event.

etc etc etc etc

Lots of little things could be turned into crat tradeskills, and make them feel like real crats.

Oh well

Purloin @ 10/31/2002 4:58:21 PM (54917):
As I see it the problem with tradeskills is twofold (i) tradeskill  development requires IP allocation at the expense of other skill;
(ii) only certain character types can tradeskill.

I am no fan of DAoC but Funcom should take a look at their concept of tradeskilling, while it too has problems I think the overall approach is better.

For instance, if there were a different set of points earned from trades, call them TI for tradeskill points, then as you hunt and kill thing you get IP as you make things you get TI, thus theroetically a level 1 character could tradeskill to top of his craft w o leveling
Secondly why not have access to specific types of tradeskills a little more availabe, say weaponsmithing  for enforcers and soldier, tailoring for MA, pharacy skills for Drs, etc.

Certainly there are many ways to do this but the main thing I would like to see is tradeskilling become viable for all and at a much lower level than currently.

Just one mans opinion.

I don't think everyone should be able to do tradeskills.  I think only certain classes should be to do tradeskills.  Engineers should do Weapon Smithing, Mech. Eng. and Elec. Eng., Traders should do everything equally well (i.e. not a specialist), Docs should do Pharm, Crats do Psychology, etc.  Keep each tradeskill specialized.  That way, you keep the economy under control, but yet have more items resulting from tradeskills out on the market.  If everyone was able to do Tradeskills, then heck, why even bother doing tradeskills?  Just raise up the skill yourself, duh.

Keep tradeskills limited to certain classes and give more XP rewards for Tradeskills.  That is the only way to have them actually flourish.

Take a hint from Everquest, this game's granddaddy...Tradeskills on EQ ended up being, essentially, a waste of time.  Because they weren't skill based, all it took was a few hours of making items, provided you had the money or the time to collect the parts, and then all you did was keep making combines, rapid-fire, til you get your skill up.  Simple, right?  Yeah, sure, but when you get like 80 people on a server who are masters of a certain tradeskill, guess how much you're going to sell that super high-level item you just made?  Yeah, you guessed it...whatever the NPC will pay for it.

Point?  Making tradeskills widespread would allow for anyone to be able to increase their skill, thus ruinning the tradeskill market.  I see why tradeskills are so expensive to do currently in this game... if they were cheap, why would you bother fighting?  Another Duh!

Folks need to realize that there are only 2 limiting factors to Players:  Level and Money.  If it doesn't take cold, hard cash to raise your skill, then you have to set a level limit (hence why the best tradeskillers are the higher level peeps).  If it didn't take levels to master tradeskills, then money is a limiting factor (like in Everquest), so if you essentially had unlimited money (which you end up having late in the game anyway), you could just about master any tradeskill you wanted.

In the end, it's a lose/lose situation, where only high level players are going to be mastering tradeskills...this is giving everyone an equal playing field, of course.

If you made tradeskills only available to certain classes, then folks who want to do tradeskills can pick those classes and do their skills, thus you've introduced a 3rd limiting factor outside of level or money...class.  Now that class is a limiting factor, you won't get a level 200 with everything and then some, bored out of his mind, dumping all his extra cash on a tradeskill, simply because he can, because he's not of the correct class.

Let's see an example:

Doctors (of which I am one) can use their Pharma skill to create various drugs...for this example, let's say First-Aid stims.  There is an even spread of First-Aid stims available to make...some QL 1s for level 1 players...QL 5 for 5th level...etc. etc. etc.  At level 1, gainning proper resources from fighting little mobs that aren't too tough, he can gain about half a level from tradeskilling for each level he gets from killing (this ratio can be adjusted for different classes).  However, now he's got these QL 1 stims, and he made them for much cheaper than what the Vendor Terminal sells them...so, he can sell them off to players for a proper price, and cheaper than a Vendor Terminal.  Thus, the Doctor is encouraged to raise his skill some more, got a proper reward, both monetary and XP-wise, and he helped out his fellow gamers by giving them items cheaper than vendors.

In the same world, there's a Soldier who doesn't have any tradeskills available to him...but, damn...he's got a big ass gun and can blow up stuff like nothing.  He rakes in cash from killing a lot more mobs than a Doc can, and yet he levels up about as fast as the Doc who did the Pharm, considering that the Soldier can kill way more mobs than the Doc can in the same amount of time.  So now, lo and behold, the Soldier needs First-Aid stims to heal himself after battle...he goes over to the Vendor Terminals, and realizes that he'd have to dump a ton of cash for some stims...but, wait, here's the Doc who just made a whole batch of stims, and is selling them at about 75% off what the VTs are selling them for!  Excellent!!  So now the Soldier goes off and happily buys some stims from the Doc...thus, now the Doc and the Soldier end up with about the same XP, and about the same amount of money.

end example.

So, in the end...I think that if you're going to do tradeskills, you know you want your character to do tradeskills...so you won't choose a Soldier.  If you want to kill stuff, you pick a Soldier.  If you want to make Pharmaceuticals, you pick a Doctor...

So that's my opinion...

Out,
Souldoctah

Purloin @ 10/31/2002 11:32:34 PM (54917):
Well we can respectfully disagree. Why should you have to be a high level to do tradeskills. There is a third limiting factor, which is playing time, if only high levels can tradeskill then casual players cannot tradeskill.

I completely dissagree with the doc... As the last person mentions, the TIME is the most important factor in my oppinion. How many times has Soldier X_Unknown come to you for a first aid kit? Do they even know you can make the kit?

I made a emergency treatment kit today. It cost me 30k for a ql32 kit, and I'll be blind 30 seconds when i use it. U think I'll use that every time I get bashed in mission (Yes yes, i know, I'll only have to use it at boss room....) What's the point? Imagine the team waiting for the tank to get his vision back... "Wait guys, i can't see a thing..."

And I made a set of Carbon armor not long ago. Cost me 340k (without the labour), ql 40, for my doc. The engineer was a lvl 60. If I was to list all the engineers level 150 and up, I think I would have had one name, and I can bet you quite a lot of credits that engie didn't have the stuff to make the armor.

There's a ton of things in this game people don't know about, and maybe one or two people try. They end up costing you so much and giving you so little, there's not much point in trying it a second time... and they get forgotten.

Can't remember who mentioned earlier, but it's true: FunCom, stop dropping uber loot in monsters, let us build a society... let us gain the money and levels in different ways than fighting. I would gladly take out my engineer out of the closet, dust it off and start making items and stuff. And I got my agent who's happy to fight. And my doc who heals the team -- and is secretly upping his psychology so that one day he'll be able to analyse crazy atrox who dream they want to have sex

Souldoctah @ 11/1/2002 6:25:57 PM (54917):
See, I think you guys missed my point.

Time is the most obvious limiting factor that any player has, but the factor of time is negated when you consider that for any sort of gain, you're going to need to spend time.  Time is what it's all about, hence it's can't be part of the equation.

Time * The rate at which you acquire money = Money
Time * The rate at which you acquire XP = XP/Level

Since any player can focus their time on either XP or Money, essentially time is not really a factor worth considering, because the limitation is really the rate at which one can acquire money or XP.

Let's say a Doctor can get 10,000 Creds in 1 hour solely from killing mobs, during this time, he can also acquire 1,000 XP.

Now, in contrast, a Soldier can get 15,000 Creds in 1 hour, and 1500 XP, solely from killing mobs.

Even though both are hypothetical, they're both reasonable...Soldiers kill things a heck of a lot easier than Doctors do.

Now, let's say a Doctor has the ability to do Pharmacy at all levels, at various QLs, and the products he makes have a decent demand, and he can provide a good supply.

In 45 minutes, a Doctor can get 7500 credits from killing mobs, and 750 XP.  Using Pharm for another 15 minutes (assume running around to collect and buy parts), he can make another 4.5K credits from selling his Pharm items, and raise up another 750 XP.

In the end, after an hour, the Doctor would've made a grand total of 12K credits, and 1500 XP.

If the Soldier int he last example would've had to spend 3K in healing supplies, then his total after an hour would've been 12K credits, and 1500 XP.

Thus, both classes have made their XP and Money ratings equal, and time is essentially not a factor.

Now, my point is that in making Tradeskills available only for certain classes, then you add to the XP and Money ratings for those classes, and assuming they have lesser XP and Money ratings in combat, you then equalize everyone's XP and Money gains over time.

A Doctor is not as good as a Soldier in combat, hence a viable tradeskill would add to the Doctor's ability to gain XP and Money, thus making the Doctor and the Soldier equal in their ability to make money and gain XP.

Of course, this is assuming that "they" allow for useful, viable items to be created cheaply by those specialized classes, with QLs ranging from 1 to 200.

Maybe what I'm saying is a bit convoluted...forgive me if that's the case.  I really want to see better tradeskills implemented, and I think that my opinion would allow for a better system (of course, everyone thinks their own opinion is the best one =D

Peace,

I replied to your post in the Exchange forum about the slashing and crushing pppe - I have both the Robot Ins Discs needed to make the PPPEs so gimme a hollar. I'm quite sure you only need the discs, they don't drop like the pppe(shape soft armor) items, they're made from discs.

Purloin @ 11/1/2002 8:09:59 PM (54917):
Lets try focussing on where I think we can agree.

Tradeskills need to be improved.

 There needs to be a market for tradeskill products in the game economy to make it viable,  over a wide range of levels.

Tradeskilling should be a viable alternative style of game play.

 Add to this for the sake of argument that tradeskills should be only available to certain character types ( since every account gets 8 slots this should not be a real issue for anyone.)

I would add that the tradeskill player should be able to complete his projects solo.{Edited to add that the quality of tradeskills products should be better than what can be found in stores and the  costs to make tradeskills products should be less than the cost of  comparable items in the stores} 

Beyond these parameters pehaps we disagree, but the key point is that  tradeskills in this game need to be substantially improved.

Has there been any word from Funcom on their plans for tradeskills? Have they at least acknowledged the problem/

 I'm not talking fancy high level armor- lowbies value armor too. ^^ Plus I'd like to make some for myself.

 Also, do at least the soft bronto hide pieces exist at a low level, and therefore is some bronto hide armor possible early on?

 Thanks a ton.

Maimgara @ 11/5/2002 9:27:55 PM (60764):
And you only need a ql ~120 MMR to make ql 200 armor

Maimgara @ 11/5/2002 9:34:22 PM (65560):
Ehm. The disc's is not available in shops. Only a rare drop off bosses - and the going price is 50 - 60 Millions (RK2), so they may be hard to come by.

Then you need a MMR, that'll set you back 1- 1.5 M, loads of money if you havn't got a guild or a high level char to fund you.
But, is you get lucky and get a disc, only your skills will set the limits. (Being trader, you got buffs - Bah!)

(Be sure to buy a ql 120+ MMR, then you can make ql200 armor when you get that far  )

Maimgara @ 11/5/2002 9:36:13 PM (64289):
Same goes for armor MMR's ?

 This solution can be used to change both the looks and properties of certain items, like e.g. Organic armor, Graft armor and Nano armor.

Limit for traders would be chemistry. Limit for engys is ME. Gee, perhaps FC wanted cooperation for the higher qls  Oh wait no they didn't they just forgot to give traders Maestro - Chemistry 

If you got lucky around level 50-60 you could use it, but "realistically" most people won't be using them until title5 or so.

Garishna @ 11/6/2002 12:54:14 PM (64465):
Is this stuff gonna be hard to find?  ie the stuff needed to make it?  I love those textures and hey, the CAS did it according to the description which sounds cool.

I can't wait to not look like a mutli colored paint spill.

Anybody have the details on how this stuff will be made?
Please Please Please tell me!!!!

YourName Here @ 11/6/2002 3:50:45 PM (65560):
Heh, my 58 Advent does nothing but look for PPPE's with a partner. We found a shape soft armor our first try. Hopefully it doesn't take another 200 missions to find another PPPE. ;p

 Yes, affording an MRR will be pricey in itself but doable with lotsa blitzing. My back armor is gonna have so many holes in it..

Animosity @ 11/6/2002 7:26:11 PM (65150):
According to the Dev's not all of the quests have been discovered/ or completed yet.

Garishna @ 11/6/2002 7:30:51 PM (64465):
Ok, the stuff is not boss drop, it's available in shops in the armor clothing suply vend or the chemisty stuff vend.  You gotta use notum to stabilize it after you open it.....
That's all I know.

Anybody got some notum pieces?  I'm guessing about the same ql as the stuff you buy.  
What do ya do then?
I'm looking for answers here.
CAS Symbiotic is supposedly the result, maybe some members of the fine Clan Anarchist Syndicate know.

Voide @ 11/6/2002 9:22:53 PM (Implant QL Question... 66057):
I have been away from the game for awhile, and I need to refresh my memory on the implant creation system. 

Does putting in lower QL clusters, like say a QL 83, into a QL 90 implant lower the final QL of the entire implant?

Also, what makes the QL of the finished implant rise? Is it based on the NP skill of the one making the implants, or does it rise if one would put in very high QL clusters into a lower QL implant

Thanks in advance,

Voide

Mercatura @ 11/6/2002 10:06:41 PM (Accelerated NCU 66083):

gwend @ 11/6/2002 10:19:09 PM (66057):
you cant lower the ql of implants can only raise adding more clusters to the imp will increase its ql

Spretten @ 11/6/2002 10:38:06 PM (64465):
I bought the "Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid" in the "Armor and Clothing Componetns" shop.

I stabilized it with a Notum Fragment.

Seems like i can change ICC Cloaks with this item, but it says that if i "Super Stabilize it" i might be able to change the properties of things.   Thats all ive found out so far.


Spretten

asango @ 11/6/2002 10:47:53 PM (64465):
yeah i also got to this point...used a notum chip to stabilize it....

mmmm...now what...super-stabilize it? wth does that mean.

Just a note on Textures... I typically don't upload textures until they hit live, basically because I don't want to have to track down individual textures that may have been tweaked by the designers in the interim period. (There are about 7000+ textures in my textures folder now, so I'm sure you can see why this wouldn't be fun. )

As an update, I'm looking into allowing linking to searches. Personally, I prefer doing everything in form post instead of querystring because it's cleaner to look at...but hopefully I'll have something figured out soon. =)

Nivenyrral @ 11/7/2002 12:32:29 AM (64465):
OK then Slag, where did you find a nano programming interface that was QL2?  Far as I can tell you can't do anything higher than ql100 with the current nano programming interface, and they only come in ql1.

Anonymous @ 11/7/2002 12:36:38 AM (64465):
check the superior stores, they are available in higher qls. I was able to use one i bought there on ql 195 inactive whatchamacallits.

I talked to superslang today and he said after making a 150ish grenade it ended up being  ql1 doing 20 dmg.. Is this the same for everyone? Is it known and i just missed someone saying that?

I sure hope i am wrong, so tell me if i am.

Razorbak133 @ 11/7/2002 1:47:25 AM (66212):
Very much a bug.  Tried to make some ql 40ish just to try them out.  Took like 150 WS to make, 150ish EE to acticate, then 10 Grenade to throw and BOOM! Instant pissed off but not dead backyard leet.

Trader Doug @ 11/7/2002 2:09:44 AM (64465):
Yep, I've figured out how to do it and will probably have a set hitting rk2 exchange sometime soon.  And this armor does look awesome.

Lunartikk @ 11/7/2002 2:26:28 AM (60764):
where u get 120 from? U need an MRR of a qlty no less than 40 to make 200 armour, but most people put a 200 in just incase funcom do what they do best and screw something up.

It's the same type of potection as regular graft and from what I've seen gives a little buff to an attribute or skill, varies with piece.  Correct me it I'm wrong.

And.... It looks cool!!!! Not like spilled paint or bruises.

the pices I got to make came from mantis in SD.
but how many that was killed for thos two pices I can't say. some guildie gave em to me so I could try and get em made.
As for PW we killed roughly 20 mantis without finding anything exept clusters and any other crap.

I know 20 isn't that many but I don't have time to do it.. need to find out how to get my trader armor made. think I got some lead on that aswell

If you bring the Notums, I would price this like I price Carbonum and Bronto. (ie, prices listed by several Master Traders in the Exchange forum)

Currently 1000-1500/ql/item I think.

Without Notum: Wait a couple of days and check what those sell for in exchange forums.

Walk/run to RK1:Omni-Ent Plat at save-point or do /list Afelia and see if I'm there. Don't /tell if those two fails.

Edit: Agree with above poster. Low QL stuff I don't have to drain or change implants to do is for TIPs only.

items my gimped doc skills can make:

virral eggs
dragon armor
bronto armor
nano crystals
weapon making
nano programing
emergency treatment labs
restoration kits
overtuning tank armor

misc items

treatment library
aggression enhancers
aggression trimmers
robot brains
coffee machines
bow ties


prices:

when it comes to prices im probably the cheapest and to keep prices down please please bring the parts needed to make the item (side from nano crystals) i cant stress this enough

i actually lost money the first time around with this little buisiness because i made so many things for free and ended up having to buy the parts to make peoples nano crystals and emergency treatment labs / fa kits :/

but speaking of free if i dont have to get buffs or implant to make the item of choice the service will either be free of charge or tips will gladly be accepted otherwise heres a list of set prices

virral eggs: 1mil per egg can go higher if you insist 
dragon armor: will discuss price
bronto: below ql100 1k per 5ql - so a ql100 piece of hide would cost you 20k to make where my competition would be charging 100-120k for the same piece
ql101-190 (200 next lvl) 1k per 2ql - ql200 piece of hide would cost 100k to make competitions price 200-220k for same piece ^^

implants: always tips
nano crystals: always tips
weapons: always tips

BrutalThug @ 11/8/2002 10:24:34 AM (66423):
The parts have different names. And seem to drop once every 4th or 5th kill. also they drop the new adv,doc and trader things

Leamartini @ 11/8/2002 10:33:43 AM (66423):
I killed 30ish Mantis in SD this morning and I didnt get a single part for Mantis Armor (got monster parts, clusters, mantis eggs, a cold stone and a soul frag too low)

I killed only 180+ Mantis so maybe i should try to kill lower ones to get some armor... (and that would mean that Mantis Armor doesnt drop at higher QLs like Notum Saturated Armor )

Eeek that would be bad. Ive had my eye on a full set of QL200 Mantis.

It doesnt seem to drop out-doors either? Just inside SD ... Which limits it even further even if the 180+ Mantis do drop.


Also the names are the parts all have "Deformed Mantidae thingy" in them i think?

and

killing the Mantisses in SD. Found low QL ones only so far, ranging from QL 80-120. Nothing from the higher mantis or from outdoor mantis. The droprate isn´t too high, so maybe I was just unlucky.

dypfryst @ 11/8/2002 3:01:11 PM (66423):
The traade thing is named:

Deformed Mantidae Mandibles
NODROP
QL 80
Wear: Trader and CL 243

And it real sux. ( read on )

Loc: Neck
Modifier:
Vehicle Air 7
Max nano 322
Max health 161

now taht is some real sucky stats since I already get +700 
from the 1k token board. maybe good for a lower lvl.
But in the database as I understood this was supposed to 
add to QFT. and that would have been greatly appriciated.
so there could bee taht they add to difrrent things sorta.
Since the advent I saw had a bit variating modifiers.

yes the parts are called Deformed Mantidae (something).
Gloves was Deformed Mantidae Wing.

just to get to clear out of it is only in SD they drop.

Tinkertrish @ 11/8/2002 6:14:18 PM (61565):
Ok since theres only tid bits of info scattered around ill gave you the lowdown.  

Notum Saturated Metaplast Armor  is made from Notum Saturated Metaplast Shell  

Apparently the shell is found on scooplets out in agean altho it drops very rarely and the Ql dosent do above 100. A guild mate of mine found one while hunting for Doga parts. 

The shell looks like the carbon sheets but it has a purpleish tinge to it. To turn the shell it into armor you follow the same process as carbon armor. First use the etch-a-sketchTM on it, i used a brestplate, and you will get something that looks like this Etched Pattern for a Notum Saturated Metaplast Breastplate Then run it thru your hard PPPE and Vola your very own Notum Saturated Metaplast Armor!

I know this is not fair, but I couldn't help laughing when I read www.anarchyarcanum.com 's description about engineer mobs:

Engineers:          
Wielding pistols and light armor, Engineers are one of the weakest mobs. They don't cast any programs, and they surely don't have any 2t slayerdroids lurking behind a corner.

I expect that the nice boys on the site will change the description soon.

Keep up the good work, your site is awesome.

Nope, as far as I can tell, only the final result is nodrop. It even explains it that way on some of the parts descriptions. The rest you can get tradeskillers to build for you, and you use some kind of register on it that makes it "your" yalm. (i.e. nodrop)

Since many of these new pharma tech's have descriptions that include Notum Powder, Notum Essence, and Notum Concentrate in them, and these do NOT appear in the DB yet, the process for refining these (i.e. the tools) aren't in game yet.

Brandon @ 11/12/2002 2:20:18 PM (65150):
Where did you get the enigma bark at?

Brandon @ 11/12/2002 2:24:07 PM (67404):
You need the notum tubes things. A NPing thing. Notum frags. Graft/organic. Use the NP thing on the notum thing. Then use the notum frags on the notum thing. Then use the thing you get on the graft armor. All very simple really. Moo

I'll go tonight and peruse the forrest.  You can get GAIV and NSII to drop off the enigma roots (large trees that don't move).

Its part of a quest like the dog tag quest altho im not sure if its live or not. If you look at this Shielded Bio-Container full of Pieces of Living Enigma Bark It goes from one to 10 just like the dog tag bags.

A handful of enigma fibers 

Good deal of enigma fibers

Absolutely as much enigma fibers as you can carry


Another quest or part of the same? <shrug>

Kzak @ 11/12/2002 6:42:56 PM (68593):
Making QL200 CAS armor requires 800 in Nanoprogramming and 900 in Chemistry, so it makes sense that you have to be high-level in order to build the top-notch stuff.

Besides, there's no Maestro for Chemistry, making things a little harder.

I've been thinking about creating an Engineer with the sole purpose of taking up tradeskills.  Just how hard is it to get into it?  Will it be a long time before I start to see any real profits by either offering my services to players or selling to shops?  Also, I'd appreciate any advice you could give to a new tradesman.  I'm very knowledgable on AO(been playing off and on since release), but I've never touched tradeskills, so I'm really clueless.

Thanks.

Most likely you won't see any profits from tradeskills til you are atleast level 150+.  You might get some at lower levels but putting much IP in tradeskills then would seriously gimp your character preventing farther developement.

Im a trader btw i made 3 gimp chars already so i do some reasearch which proffesion is good on tradeskills.. since trader got buffs on most of the trade skills.. also thier wrangles are indemand

Culin @ 11/13/2002 5:30:26 PM (QL of Notum for CAS armor 69225):
According to the CAS armor guide on anarchyarcanum.com, 

"For every part of the CAS armor you intend to create you will also need two Notum Fragments or Notum Chips, or one of each. These can not be lower than 10% of the Nanobots we only just now purchased, or the procedure wont work."

Is this a misprint?  If not, why the demand for QL170+ Notum when much lower QLs will work?

QL170+ makes QL200 pieces I believe... that is why the prices run so high.

FireC @ 11/13/2002 9:36:12 PM (69225):
It's been said on this board a few times now .

Armour ql x 0.90 tells you what ql the liquid needs to be at least and liquid x 0.90 tells you what ql notum you need to use. So lowest possibles for ql200 armour are ql162 notum which needs exactly ql180 liquid to work.

Considering how the ICC cloaks only come in QL50-100 you probably don't really have an option for any better back armour than those cloaks . Low level tank armours are rare and also look quite bad.

Then there's the other end of the spectrum. At level 25, I made 50,000 credits just for putting some guy's gun together. It was an easy job, and only took a weaponsmithing of 120. Another job was assembling an implant for only 1,000. Making money without dealing with other players is a different story; jewelry and pharmacy is about all you can do.

If you enjoy working with other players and spamming "LOWBIE TRADESKILLS FOR HIRE PLZ SEND TELL!" or something like that, it's definately worth it. Just don't type in all caps like that.

Wasn't it you how fixed mine yesterday?

I got a Faded Immortal Katana from CB and already had a SCC Energypack lying around in the bank. 
You shift-right-click the pack on the Katana to make it a normal one (require Elect. engi.).
The resulting Immortal Katana can be improved (couldn't it?). 
Dunno if the improving raises QL or whatever. If I see you online tonight Honeyperl, maybe we could try improving it again? It Went from ql 74 to ql 80 when you fixed/improved it.

Well I still enjoy hunting/exploring, as do some others that I've met in the middle of nowhere, in passing, but always very friendly, sharing knowledge regardless of alignment.

I was lead to this thread by my interest in Special Agent Lamb (with his crazy health bar) and the Enigma trees - Deep Artery Valley - after cruising the Drill Island 'fort' (or whatever you want to call it), Enigma Island, the Emerite statue and Golem Island on my way to get some Carbonum rocks - thought I'd take the scenic route.

Just wondered if anyone had managed to killed the Enigma trees around Special Agent Lamb (DaveDread?) Is he guarding them? and what's with the treehouse thing?

Also of relevance to the thread title are the Medusas and the Thin Plasteen Loop that holds Medusa rings - seems to require 50 rings just like the Bio-Container requires 50 bits of Living Enigma Bark.

I'm sure there are many places where Medusas can be found, but the ones I saw were East of Drill Island pressing T revealed that they would be pretty sure of killing me if I tried .  You never know, maybe the Forest Emerties in the same area drop Bark- I could only target them (hiding underground I suppose) but they may 'eat' roots as I'm fairly sure that there were Enigma trees in their vicinity.

There's many other things along the same lines.  One that might just be some sort of tradeskill is related to Radioactive Roots of Khamak Tree and Radioactive Antibiotics - again, just messing in the db and prolly old news.

Anyway, interesting and fun thread.  Don't forget that it appears the bark, medusa rings etc were only patched in 14.6, so not that old.

Regards, Eta

Now we only need Funcom to realise that only 5-10% of the tradeskill community got the shape hard/soft tools.

Funcom let us mortal trades and engineers (and other tradeskillers) have a chance to get Shape Soft Armour and Shape hard Armour. We are alot of people with money strong guilds to back us up. Increse drop rate, make them buyable, I don't care, just remove them from the ultra rare list

Nice guess, but if you look through the DB there is something about a paint job with the names of the other Yalms. So unless the Hot stone is used to make the paint, which very well could be, then I'd say its something else.

The D9 just use the same skin as the Techtronica. As does a Flamethrower and River6. Supernova, IEC Flashpoint and Westinghouse. Blackhole and Steiner are also weapons wich uses same skin. 

Are many more out there, so check name and info of items in the future as there might be gems hidden under your very nose

Khaitlene @ 11/15/2002 5:05:40 PM (AO Tradeskills have improved 10 Fold !! 70009):
Not sure if its just me, but I am very happy with all the new tradeskill items that have been added to the game in the past few months (carbonum, CAS, weapon upgrades, etc.). Initially I was disappointed with the implementation, but recently it has greatly improved. Now, if they could only increase the drop rate of certain items needed (soul frags, PPPe's, etc.), that would be a further improvement to a system that just continually gets better.

Keep up the good work !!

If people are sending out shouts or requests to buy something you figure is junk.. you might just want to hold onto it as it will be the next 'notum frag'.  10M is AVG for any frag that is 163+ in QL.

I figured I should save the notum frags 2 months ago and I must say.. now that I've pocked over 100M credits from the frags I had laying around that it seemed to be a good investment in the future.

(so.. next time don't sell anything if someone wants it and you think its junk unless you know what it does!)

RVWinkle @ 11/15/2002 9:44:05 PM (70009):
I'm happy with all the tradeskills. I'm not sure what they're doing with the drop rate I guess they want it to be rare and unique. I think it would be fun though to see more people with full suits of CAS and bronto armor, as of now that privlege is only for the very rich.

I'd also like to see more uses for weapon smithing. The MCS is cool but you can mission for it. I get a few requests for the Sol Chronis smg and River XP sometimes but you still have to find the parts. Howabout a popular gun that can only be made and all the parts are available from shops. When I say popular, I mean it'd be competitive with something like the X-3 rifle.

Haohmaru @ 11/15/2002 10:30:18 PM (67760):
I ran ql 73 for about a month, hunting for GAII.  Found a pppe shape hard in one of those.  So, dunno how much mission ql matters.  BTW, i'm a schmuck.  I sold it w/i an hour of finding it for only 50m.  D**n.  

/me area bursts in the general direction of my foot

Beautyfarm @ 11/16/2002 12:34:59 AM (69958):
i would hold on to it however, who knows..

Hodelay @ 11/16/2002 1:17:57 AM (69962):
Hi,
 I have only made the ql 200 MCS but i believe Chemical Chamber and the Barrel needs to be within 10% of the base and the Carbonum Sheet needs to be within 5% of the base.  

Also be warned that each process in making a MCS can raise the QL of the base gun by 1 point. If you buy the exact QL required at the start you might find that you are no longer able to use that part because the QL of the base has increased.

hope that helps

Pays007 @ 11/16/2002 1:35:16 AM (70009):
CAS armor looks awesome. But if its super easy to get the parts its just gonna become old and boring real fast. It would be nice for it to be a little more common, but too common is not good.

Brandon @ 11/16/2002 5:40:41 AM (67342):

NOOOOO .... don't increase the drop rate of the PPPE's ... then ill be out of a job ^^

Platy @ 11/16/2002 2:04:21 PM (67342):
No, i wasn't pulling his Boci's chain, I just didn't realise that my agility was already above the requirement due to my implants, so I ran around and got all the stamina buffs I needed first 
So when i put it on I had both stamina and agility above 550 

pfff! - I am an atrox you know!

Up to QL100, ICC Cloaks are in general superior to tank armor.  There is a slight amount of opinion involved in this statement, since what specific damage type you are concerned about is of course going to be a consideration.

Monster Egg Containment Field, does anyone know what this does?
when i right click on it  it says "sniff" over my guys head
"This containment field seems to be holding a unhatched egg from some (unknown?) montser. It could be worth alot."

Halestorm @ 11/17/2002 12:28:33 AM (70438):

TanisAS @ 11/17/2002 5:27:02 PM (69211):
I thought the improved stuff was just the over ql200 armour (the omni pol i mean) that drops off of the primus mobs at the old ace camp .

Tinkertrish @ 11/18/2002 12:07:47 PM (70848):
You also find allot of strange items in the patch like:

Ashes of Leet Fur
Dis:
This is the powder that remains after burning the fur of a Leet. It has gone through many purification faces, and is now ready to be used in the production of medical products.

Atrox Eye Jelly 
Dis:
The DNA of the Atrox breed has some very strange effects on medication containing this component. Studies have shown that the concentration in the eyes have especially high concentration of certain chemicals.

Bubbling Nanite Brew
Dis:
This bubbling brew is the result of combining essence of Leet blood and positronic nanites. It is teaming with life, but needs something more to make it useful.

Calming Cocktail
Dis:
The mixture of Leet blood and mutated bacteria makes a very calming drink, too calming for good health. It can however be mixed with more products in an attempt to make something useful of it.

Concentrated Nanofreak Urine 
Dis:
Drink this and it will make you UBER! 

well ok i made that last description up, but anyway you get the point ... so it smells like a tradeskill process to me ... among other things >.<

My guess the process will require pharma skillz to make these ...err not soo yummy.... but usefull potions.

SmenGromit @ 11/18/2002 12:10:09 PM (70949):

/tell jakeaway ingame

Elbo @ 11/18/2002 3:06:45 PM (70949):
Very important..

Use only the Fink Fragrant Morning Enhanced Coffee Block to make your machine.  As you can see in the last few comments that the Menthol version is 'useless'.

Unless you really want that 1 extra point in Psychic.

iguanoid @ 11/18/2002 3:10:03 PM (70949):
hehe - i already made that mistake.  Kind of stupid of me to think that i wouldnt be able to wash that menthol taste out of my coffee machine.  How was i supposed to know it would make my coffee minty for ever...

still i found this new one and now i can enjoy both,without being mad at myself

Seraphim @ 11/18/2002 4:12:33 PM (A suggestion. 71020):
Since Spybot went live, I have been thinking of having a tradeskill bot. 

The concept would be the same as spybot, but aimed toward the tradeskillers. 

Your thoughts?

Mercatura @ 11/18/2002 8:37:34 PM (70975):
Keeping these rare was a dumb idea. Might as well make hacker tools be as rare, B&E is useless as a tradeskill without one, same for chemistry...so why are they so rare? The armor parts are rare/expensive enough themselves, besides monster meat anyways. I don't think a flood of thick flesh hoods would screw up the game 

They should drop in disc form, and at least as often as any other new nano.

Elbo @ 11/18/2002 9:22:22 PM (71020):
I can't confirm nor deny...

But I heard it was right behind the kamikazi bot for engineers.

Thanks Myiria. 

I just have to hold my breath until someone figures how to make the calming potion. That sounds like something definitly usefull for us/me engi .

Any further info. Like anything that got assembled yet. And also info on wich mobs drop what apreciated .

Brandon. I am playing this game mostly because of the tradeskills. Until player created items, become best ingame items besides unique's. We gotta go a long way. 

Kinda dispointed that Doc forum dosent mention anything about that. I guess it will be up to us engis to figure that out. since the rest of the classes including trader prefer other things. 

Might be that we dont have anything other to do

SmenGromit @ 11/19/2002 11:33:50 AM (58972):
Smen, 158 engie.

I try to help out when I can. I usually don't charge anything, but that implies that I can do stuff at my own tempo, and that I get the parts needed - except for nano parts which are real cheap. I may use the "no" word if I have customers waiting.

With buffs I can do:

Soft/hard armor (dragon, carbo, CAS, barter, bronto, mantis) up to ql 200.  Buff: only SFA needed, usually quick.

Non-jobe implants up to ql 200. Buff: only ASM needed to get 1000+ NP, usually quick.

Nanos up to approx ql 190. Buff: Needing several Maestro buffs to do 190'es. May take time.

Within a few levels I will also make VT eggs.

I think most people find me trustworthy. If I accidentally should destroy/lose something while assembling, you will be reimbursed with the market/shop price of the item. 
(Yes, it has happened that I f.ex made three carbo sleeves while sleeping at the keyboard)

Beautyfarm @ 11/19/2002 1:15:51 PM (71206):
to give you a better idea, all weapon construction kit in game are:

1- useless, better buy/mission for weapons, the constructable ones plain suck and if you for whatever reason REALLY want them, its cheaper to buy them in store than to built ( makes sense, doesnt it  )

2 - bugged. according to some patch notes lately they have been fixed, i didnt try though, due to 1.

the few weapons you can actually improve ( not build ! ) are of no interest to an agent.

Beautyfarm @ 11/19/2002 1:20:38 PM (58972):
another note on petard12 on rk2, i made some business with him, pretty valuable stuff partly. nulltiy, ga, CAS. never had any problems.
i dont know what was going on in your team dyna, but i would rate him as very reliable.

Sallust @ 11/19/2002 2:40:59 PM (70975):
It pretty much is that rare from what I've seen.
Which is crazy given that it is the key components to one of the most viable tradeskills in the game. Seeing all the armor tradeskills that are getting added it keeps becoming more viable of a tradeskill every patch now.

Please increase the droprate on these.

I'm a lvl 24 NT and this guy asked me to make him a couple implants and i was like sure.  I wasn't really expecting anything in return.  When i was done making it, he gave me 40,000.  And i was just wondering if that is how much i should charge for future Implants or if he was just being generous.  If not how much should i charge in the future, if i ever do it again???

iguanoid @ 11/19/2002 4:58:11 PM (71379):
probably a high levelplayer playing his alt...most players your level wouldnt be able to pay that under there own funds, imagine what a full set of imps would cost 

if someone doesnt tip you for your time, maybe you wont help them next time.  Just look at how much cash you can generate through missions and you have an idea how much money other people of your lvl have...

Yeah, by "as common as other nanos" I didn't mean GA/NS, I meant like the new adv/agent/enf/fix nano droprates on bosses.

It should be so at most someone should charge you a mill for one. And it should drop from at least ql60-200, not "only" ~ql60 boss/chest like now.

The weapon instruction discs aren't rare, why are armor ones?

Its bad enough for lowlevs that MRRs are pricey.

Imagine if a hacker tool or bio-comminutor was as rare as NS2 or GA4. Thats how stupid it is.

Having rare parts is fine, but not tools.

Going by the exchange forum, it seems that people think the pppe hard is more valuable than the pppe soft, AFAIK hard is just for carbonum.  Where as with soft you can make Bronto, dragon, flesh hood and metallic mantis.

Am I missing something?  

the world is flooded with carbonum.

I have heard different things about finding PPPE hard and soft.

i know u can find it in aprox ql57 team mission, but i was wandering if it is only a boss loot item or if i can find it in chests and on mobs too??

edit:  i dont really want to run past all those chests if they might be there.

Intrepid @ 11/20/2002 7:20:17 PM (71854):

CAS/Barter armor needs no PPPE at all =)

Elbo @ 11/20/2002 9:10:57 PM (71711):
OK....

Saturated notum armor isnt found in the game yet is it?

Also CAS armor requires only chemistry and 2 notum chips and some graft/organic armor and some tube thingy..

No PPPE required.

cold @ 11/20/2002 9:28:30 PM (71711):
It also requires nanoprogramming for activating the nanobots, not sure what is needed for stabilizing, pharma tech ?

Saturated armor should be here soon, I've seen it on Notum Wars screenshots

Krabbus @ 11/20/2002 9:35:46 PM (71711):
no need for pharma when making CAS. Think the skills required is 1xQL in NP and 4.5xQL in Chem

4.5x chem is correct...but NPing is a bit more, something like 3.5x

Wobble @ 11/21/2002 10:29:04 AM (71854):
unfortunately I think if they were dropping more frequently we'd see a lot of them in the exchange forum, but as there are hardly any.. I'd say they are still rare  

I'm saving up for one as It's turning out to be too much trouble trying to explain to a team of newbies that i just need the key and coords for a 57-60 team mission, and once i'm inside they can delete it.. I'd pay like 200k a mission for some newbies to do this, but it seems beyond all but a few of them.

so atm i'm at 50m  I recon I have about 30m more to go before I can win an auction for a pppe soft..  anyone else think this is a bit stupid?

But putting notums into the liquid nanobots can be 3.5xQL in NP

anyone wanna help me make this pistol?

6.-Solar-Powered Engineer Pistol- 
Sometimes ideas hit you like lightning. This happened to me one day as I searched the body of a deceased Slayerdroid. Sometimes you can find a thing called a 'Experimental Nanobot Classifying Computer' on them. As I held it in my hand I knew at once what it could be used for. Earlier in the day I had found one of those nanobot jars while doing a mission for some unspecified employer. Filling the energized nanobots from the 'Mist Filled Jar' into the nanobot containment chamber of the 'Experimental Nanobot Classifying Computer' I managed to turn it into an 'Energized Nanobot Transmitter'. I could hook my 'Solar-Powered Machinist Pistol' onto this and get the 'Solar-Powered Engineer Pistol'. 

7. -Solar-Powered Master Engineer Pistol- 
Again, an improvement was discovered while researching a completely different project. This time I was trying to find a way to accelerate the speed of the individual NCU instead of using the cumbersome recomplier. The process is as follows: Use the 'Nano Programming Interface' to re-program the 'Nano Formula Recompiler'. You get a 'Re-configured Nano Formula Recompiler'. Now get some skilled person to use a 'Lock Pick' on a normal type of 'NCU Memory' to disconnect it. Connect the 'Re-Configured Nano Formula Recompiler' with the 'Disconnected NCU Memory' and get an 'Accelerated NCU Memory' - which should speed up the time you use to run nano programs from the NCU. 
The next step can be a difficult one. What you need to find now is a 'Crystalized Medusa Queen Hippocampus'. This is a singular part of the medusa brain that seems to work in symbiosis with nanobots. Merge the 'Accelerated NCU Memory' with the 'Crystalized Medusa Queen Hippocampus' to create the 'Symbiotic NCU'. You will understand how once you have the parts needed. Finally attach your 'Solar-Powered Engineer Pistol' to the 'Symbiotic NCU' and get your 'Solar-Powered Master Engineer Pistol'.

You can use ql 60 notum for ql 75 armor, if combined with exactly ql 67 'Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots'.

Armor ql * 0.9 for minimum liquid ql  --> * 0.9 again for minimum notum ql. Or in other words: The notum must be 81% the ql of the armor.

There is no upper ql limit for the notum you could use, but using high ql notum would be overkill and a waste.

they drop off peter lee, nelly johnson, ian warr, patricia johnson and the other mercenaries in the old ace camp, they must be spawned with a quest that you recieve from the high commander in the ICC near the statue, they only stay spawned for so long, so youve gotta kill em fast, took omni close to 40 people to take him down in the time required.

Apart from kami bots

If the process was implimented, you should be able to take an empty instruction disk, and a blank symbol library, to drop into a the can thing. Then you would get your rock, process it, and slap on a blank crystal reflective pattern. combining the two would create a blank nano crystal that could be uploaded but does nothing. Why would you want do do that? well, if you are playing an engineer you seem to have a great appreaciation for wasting time and money for little return, so this would be a valuable waste of your time!

I would do it.

I've got a complaint.  I get a guy who wants a QL215 MP nano made.   Has the disc and a QL226 rock.  Wanted me to make it for 50K. 

1 person put on ignore.

After that I get a guy who wants me to make him a gun a chemical gun (fixer).  Doesnt know what parts he needs to make.  I tell him to go research it and get back to me with the correct parts.  He asks me if I could buy the items he needs to make it.  I tell him I don't shop for anyone.  Then he asks me how he should research it.  I had already given him www.anarchyarcanum.com or www.virral.com.

2nd person put on ignore.

I get this guy busting me to make him 2 sets of carbonum armor.  QL8 for one of his guys and a QL40 set.  No tip (not that I would have taken it just a thanks).   I can't remember what he wanted after that but it would have required me to go shopping for someone else.  I said no and he starts bugging about it.

3rd person put on ignore.


Advice:  Know what you want.  Bring the parts.  Don't be cheap in tipping for items that require alot of skill or implant swaping or  requires a hard or soft armor PPPE.

You'll get along with people that can really help you make that SWEET gun you always wanted or armor for your twink or give you advice on what others are using.  Don't press them to help you.  Don't demand attention.  No one owes YOU ANYTHING if you don't like it then raise your tradeskills up and do it yourself.  If you can't then behave.  Tradeskills people are not here for YOUR personal pleasure in the game.

no that is Soft also...

the thing is.. when the PPPE first came the only thing you could
make was carbon and bronto...

since carbon was easyer to get, and the fact that nano init, max
nano and NCU got upped by it made ppl chose that istead of 
bronto that had better AC but only maxed nano..

Most ppl that got bronto did it to use something that looked
a bit diffrent.. also the bronto chest as far as I know is still not ingame..

still carbon is popular by by low/mid lvl ppl... and that prolly
make it more wanted..

Razorbak133 @ 11/24/2002 3:23:56 AM (72745):
f'in amen brother.  I don't mind doing trade skill stuff but I get kinda insulted when a person just grabs the item and runs when done and doesn't even say thanks.  I tend to refuse most tips since alot of stuff people want doesn't require swapping implants but when I have to go visit Mr. Surgery clinic and start swapping stuff around, the least the person can do is offer a reasonable tip.  After all, I could be out xping or playing another character rather then help.

Bottom line, if you want help, be kind and nice to the person, know exactly what you need and have the parts ready.  And be prepared to pay for the services.

Seraphim @ 11/24/2002 3:35:54 AM (72745):
I agree. This annoys me to the extreme when people ask me to make stims for them, and expect me to run and fetch the necessary parts. And when I finally get it into their heads that they should buy parts (after explaining to them by macros how the QL of the parts corresponds to each other) in the range of their FA, and still in four cases out of five, they end up with components way out of their FA skill.

I don't think I need even to mention that these people also accuse you of being a griefer or something else absurd.

Curmudgeon @ 11/24/2002 4:12:37 AM (71854):
Got a PPPE (Soft) off a team boss last week (between 14.6 and 14.7). We were around 50th, the mission was around QL63 and the boss was in the low 60's.

Now I just need to figure out what to do with it. I know you combine it with a MRR, but how high a QL of MRR do you need to use? Thse things are spendy!

Curmudgeon @ 11/24/2002 4:23:12 AM (Have PPPE, how high QL does MRR need to be? 73363):
I actually found a PPPE (Soft) in a team mission off the boss. Boss was low 60's.

Now I wonder how high QL of MRR I need with it. Those MRR suckers are expensive, so I don't want to waste a ton of money. However, the PPPE is so rare, I want to make sure and use as high an MRR as I'll EVER need. I know Anarchy Arcanum says that QL40 is enough to make QL200 armor, but that doesn't seem right and I'd love to hear verification from someone who actually uses one.

Also, is there a skill check to convert your PPPE?

Thanks,
The Cur

Intrepid @ 11/24/2002 5:07:06 AM (73363):
Your best bet is to get the highest on possible 190+  Yes it does cost a few mil more but won't you be pissed off if you get a ql60 one and funcom changes the way it works in the future??

Curmudgeon @ 11/24/2002 5:40:37 AM (73363):
Yeah, that's the advice I'd give me too. Of course my Trader has only got a couple hundred in each of the three skills needed to combine the MRR and the PPPE. SO now I have to ask myself if I want to hand a QL189 MRR and PPPE (Soft) to a stranger and tip them to combine. Or sit on it for months until my Trader can make it. Or sell the damned thing and buy one in a few months. Dilemmas, dilemmas.

Kzak @ 11/24/2002 1:25:57 PM (71854):
Play it safe, use a QL190+ MRR. Just in case FunCom change the requirements for making armor later; if you've bought a QL20 MRR and put the PPPE into it, it might not work after such imagined changes.

Tentumbs @ 11/24/2002 9:51:59 PM (68773):
I did made one just for that purpose. (Engi)
I used a 4 mill on it to get it up to lvl ~40 after that it was was producing more money than I used (Single mission).

When I hit the lvl 100 title cap i started serius to use IP on trade item skills. Not wery good, but ok. When i hit the 150 cap I could max them (I did not use IP on anything else than Pet realated and self containing (runskill))

I do not earn much on the trade skill but thet is manly due to I dont have one of the PPPE (Earn more in missions than doing trade skills at the same game time)

But I must agree with the other here. Trader is superb on tradeitem skill except that they must use IP on other things to be able to level.

I didnt spend a lot of money for my trader from lvl 1-100, most of my stuffs and nano are blitzed by me since trader got calm.. although it takes time and a lot of nanoc init at 1st (im an opifex btw so speed is not too much of a problem) i loaned a 500k in guild to get my ql 70ish implants at lvl 40ish and then start working on sealed receptacles and chem maussers.. also some jewelry crafting, with that i bought myself a new set of imps and a yalm. At lvl 100 i bought myself a pppe hard.. i borrowed some money in a guild though, but i payed it back after a week. right now im generating 5-10mill a day just by doing wrangles and tradeskill stuff.

I am thinking of buying a GA armor and start a fixer because of that anima of abomination nano crystal is worth 500k in trader store plus the mission reward of 100k+ all in all is 600k per crystal and fixer can blitz it in a matter of minutes (all in BS home). my friend fixer filled a bag with that crystal in less than 3 hrs it worth around 9mill in the trader shop.

Im still not sure why many people say engis are better than trader on tradeskills.

Tentumbs @ 11/24/2002 11:29:32 PM (68773):
Engies ain't better at them. Trader is superior due to the nanoes. (I play a Engi)
The only advance the Engi got is that he don't have to use any IP on anything else than Attributes, Trade Skills and nano (Ofcource running, Body dev, Nano pool, Map Navig i.e., but thats for everyone)

No IP on any weapon skills, No IP on evades, No IP on speed (expept running) and so on. Therefor a Engi has a lot of IP to use on tradeskills. Except from that it got all the traditem skill green or light green so it can have the same skills that a trader on same level.

  This is the only thing i dont agree on, putting people on ignore.  I started a Eng recently because i wanted to get into tradeskills.  Whenever some guy asks me a stupid question i know it's because they dont know any better, i've dont the same and to elbo.  I asked him if he'd make me a ql 215 nano, offered him 2 bags full of nano stuff (ql 200+ rocks nano discs) and some credits.  then we hit a little static, i threw a comment about i thought he was better then ethernal so on i got put on ignore lol, but ultimately i deserved it, but had i known tradeskills better i doubt that wolud've happend but then i was never told what you should do for tradeskills.  like when somone says "willing to make nanos accepting tips" i'm sure 75% 0f the non-tradeskill ppl think, "hey i got a few discs, maby i can get them made" then when they approach the trader/eng and ask only to be put on ignore i think it turns them off to tradeskills alot... But on the flipside people should know what they are doing beafore they start, and i can see how it would get anoying for 100 ppl a day asking about it.   On the price thing you sholud pay or give somthing if your having somthing made, even ql 10 discs.  i think the only problem is there isnt a set price on discs, or ppl think they can talk the maker down.

Then she says and i quote "FASTER" I would have stoped and walked away right there if i hadent of hit the wrangle button just as she said it. So wrangle her and she goes "ty" and runs away. 

I really cant stand the rudeness of some people sometimes. I mean tips are nice i've gotten 200k from people for a 50 point wrangle and 10k for doing a whole set of ql 125 implants but its the consideration and thankfullness that is the best tip.

They pay for your time effort and ofcourse the IPs spent on the tradeskills/buffs you are asking for wrangles makes them debuffs for 3 mins and tradeskills needs tremendous amount of IPs, even if most of our tradeskills are green most of the trade skill stuff requires a combination of elect engi and mech engi .. sometimes it requires all the tradeskills like making a nano crystal.. it needs elect engi/ mech engi / quantum FT / nano prog and comp litt

Anyway some other ppl are willing to pay 1k per ql or per point on the service they want other do pay more, tips or just a simple thanks will do too but the consequences is ppl pile up just to get your free and cheap services, maybe if u started a tradeskill char u will know how hard to deal with lots of ppl asking how/what/where questions regarding tradeskills asking every 5 mins when your in town.

Anyway if your not willing to pay for it u can go look for others doing it for free or maybe start your own char who can do it for you.

Sorry to break it to you, they pretty much allready are if you aren't willing to go to a small extent of helping a person out, thats why they pay you, to do the exterraneous things that make it simple enough for people so they dont have to learn weapon smithing. Not everyone is proficient in it, not everyone even specializes in it. You gave them sites to look at. okay, but how are they supposed to search through all that stuff to find what they need and if they went to that extent, why are they asking you to assemble the gun? You want people to go do all the work themselves aside from the basic assembly and on top of all that you want a payment of over 50K? Sorry to break it to you but who the heck would actually think a guy like that would be deserving of the money or waste of time talking to them? 
			
		
	

Let me get this right.. your saying if I gave someone the sites to look at (anarchyarcanum for instance..)  that you couldnt click on the weaponsmithing and then see out of the 5-6 options the one that looks like his gun and oddly enough is called Chemical Streaming Maussers?

HOW ****ING PATHETIC.

You will find no one here who actively does tradeskills will go shopping for anyone but the best of friends for 'tips'.

BTW: You don't know what it takes to make a QL215 nano.  Its painfully obvious.  BTW Whats your name in game on RK2 so I can put you on ignore!  (That part will make me happy)

THEDEACON! @ 11/26/2002 9:36:53 PM (Great implant service available! 74508):
Up to 1247 Nanoprogramming available. 

Pricing goes likes this: Pay me what you can afford to pay me, but still keep in mind the time and effort it took me to max out my nanoprogramming skill (aka 20,000 credits for 12 ql200 implants is downright a mean thing to do, you know who you are....). 

I'm a nice guy, real easy to work with, so please show a bit of compassion when you tip. 

Special implants: 

I'm not set up for the jobeclusters and given my difficulty in finding teams as an MP, I probably never will be  

All clusters that require a higher than 1020 skill are billed at an extra rate, depending on how much np is needed. One cluster comes to mind, which is the ql200 shining max nano cluster, which goes into the chest. This particular implant requires 1200np skill to assemble (implant switching is necessary), so that particular cluster is 2 million. 

Refined clusters I have never done before, but I am assuming they are quite similar to the shining nano cluster for the chest. So pricing at 2mil for refined clusters as well. NOT 2 mil per cluster, just 2mil above what you would normally pay. 

other services: 

Mochams: I honestly feel that MPs should be a bit more careful about throwing these around, as they are the only thing folks want us for anymore. Please respect that while I am lfg, I will not be buffing mochams. Instead, invite me to your team and you'll get the buffs for free, the entire time that we are missioning together (what's better than that?). I don't chase after pets and you'll find that my rifle/nuke and occasional pet damage is actually quite decent. 

Custom built implants/implant advice: I'm familiar with many classes out there, but my two areas of expertise are Metaphysicists and Martial Artists. If you're not sure what you need, just say "Deac, help me out here, I'm a lvl xxx profession xxx and I want to accomplish xxx". I'll make a custom nano nanny file for you, tell you what buffs you need, what skills you need, etc. If you're a lvl 162 MA, I'll tell you what you need to self cast uvc and ffok and design your implants around that. 

All in all, a great service. I joke around alot, but I'm an honest, hardworking guy. Sometimes, when I've shouted lfg for an hour, I may be a bit quiet or jaded or downright frustrated, but understand that I'm still that same deac you all know

Refined (Jobe) Implants do not require nano programming.  Pharmtech or Psychology.

Hi there! Just a question about your services... do I have to give you the parts to assemble or do you have them? I mean, if I ask you for something like a QL90 Head implant with Shining(Polymorhping), Bright(Inner Energy) and Faded(Empathy), would you make it and sell it for me?

FixerGigg @ 11/26/2002 11:00:21 PM (71854):
A couple patches ago I found 2 PPPE (Shape Soft Hard)'s doing QL 60 team missions exact.  Found them doing team missions from Tir to Rhinoman Valley in Newland Desert, only did 9 team missions with a friend and found them both.  Maybe it was luck, Maybe not.

..::EDIT::..

both dropped off the bosses.

Buzzboy @ 11/26/2002 11:11:18 PM (72745):
Have to agree with Elbo that Swordfishes comment shows zero insight - tradeskills take time to do for which we get negligible xp, and getting the tradeskills high enough takes ages of adventuring to get the ip - expecting us to do your shoping for you is frankly laughable. I will happily take time to explain to a newbie the basics of construction, and give them useful url s. But if someone with a mid to high level character starts buging me its url s only as if you have enough time to level your character that much you have enough time to read want you want. After all the tradeskillers have to find enough time to read it all and we manage.

I could certainly do that, but I would require payment up front for the clusters and implant.  Seeing as it'd only be ql90, I wouldn't add an extra 'shopping' fee, but if someone needed a full set of ql200s purchased and assembled, there'd be a fee for the time it takes to hunt for clusters

Jica @ 11/26/2002 11:52:31 PM (Tradeskill Services Offered 74561):

Its for both Supply Masters, Smug is the Clan one is WW and Eel is the one at Base 2 in Avalon, they give a little thing for building towers =D

Zickens @ 11/27/2002 12:52:07 AM (Nanoclusters. Tips on finding those? 74584):
Heya! Well, I have been in AO for time now and recently found how tedious is the Nanocluster finding work. Could someone plase give me some tips about where to find them? I just can´t find the right QL ones I need to put in my implant.

Someone must have already discussed about this here but I just can´t seem to find a post and sites only explain which nanoclusters I need to make a certain implant. Oh, and already got nanonanny...

Whenever I go to a shop (basic/adv/sup) I can never find a cluster near the QL lvl of my implant. (I heard the difference, either up or down, must be a max of 15% QL lvl)

Things like this would help:

1. Do different stores in different locations give the same QL clusters?

2. How much time does it need for a shop to respawn and offer different cluster types? (Zoning in and out doesnt seem to work and different people get the same QL clusters, already tried that)

3. What are the best shops to buy clusters in Omni Tek side?

4. Anyone has any time-saving tip or strategy... I spent about 3hours to get like 5 implants done!!!

Well... hope anyone can help me :)))

Thanks!

Farmacist @ 11/27/2002 1:27:17 AM (74584):
General Chizhik here!

here are some things i find helpful when i go shoping for nanoclusters for new implants.

1- don't assume that you will have your complete set of implants done in one day. the shopping part of implant making is the most time consuming aspect of the tradeskill as you already found out. I usually keep a large backpack sepparate for my implants and clusters where i gather all the nessesary components until i have everything on my shopping list. 

2- i don't know much about respawn time for items in shops but i usually do 1 runarround and find all the parts that are availible at that time, then go do something else like hunt or mission, then go do another run through the stores.

3- on the OT side the best place to go shopping is obviously Omni Trade since it has several shops of the same kind and ql level all in the same place. the basic setup for shops in Omni Trade is asfollows: you have your various vendors on the inner circle by the statue, such as weaponsmith, armor trader, container supplier, and a few more. the perimiter followiing that circle you will find shops specialising in Miir fasion wear. The perimiter following that contains the basic shops. The outermost ring is where you will find you ordinary (advanced and supperior) and special (advanced and superior) shops. i usualy do 1 full run around the advanced/supperior shops to get my implant supplies. keep in mind that you will not find everything you need the first run arround.

4- on a final note here are some wacky time saving strategies i found helpfull: I got a yalm and now i fly virually anywhere...but thats a rather costly one time investment that you may not aquire any time soon. if there is a fixer handy in our org. ask him to give you a run buff, which will minimize the ammount of time it takes you to run form 1 store to another

Farmacist @ 11/27/2002 1:31:02 AM (73629):
Thanks everyone i got it all figured out! since i'm on the OT side ~ it took me a whole while to fly all the way to Avalon. but i found out that those OT's contain not just that one quest but actually a whole bunch. I'm sure the clan side does as well. If you get a chance to go the it's kinda fun.

Hodelay @ 11/27/2002 1:34:35 AM (72745):
I thin both Elbo and Swordfish have valid points.   

Elbo has the right to practice his tradeskills whichever way he sees fit and if you wish to his secure his services you should  know what he does and does not provide.    Kinda like do not order a Whopper at McDonalds

On Swordfishes side there are many players who do not particularly care to know the ins and outs of tradeskills they just want the finished product.  With alot of my Carbonum Armor customers they just know what QL they want the armor in.  They couldn't care less about the process nor do they wish to waste their time in learning the process.  I do explain to them that it will cost them more if I do all the purchasing and most are more than happy to pay the extra cost to save themselves the time and trouble of learning the process.
Kinda like not having to bring the oil & filter when you get an oil change for your car.

I think it's just a matter of letting people know what type of service you are willing to provide.

Farmacist @ 11/27/2002 1:37:17 AM (74382):
i don't know about hot stones being useful for anything besides jewelry making but i heard rumors ingame that cold stones will be someway useful with the comming of the booster pack. (something about yalms). i odnt' know whether this is true. can someone shed some light onto that?

Hodelay @ 11/27/2002 1:48:58 AM (74382):
Hot Stones are not used for anything other than jewlery at this time but you might want to save them just in case they become useful like Notum Chips/Fragments.

ColdStones are used in the construction of Yalmaha Stilettos or at least thats what the discription of the construction kits states.
Yalmaha 29500 - Stiletto Building Kit

Mercatura @ 11/27/2002 3:04:28 AM (74584):
It would be nice if AO in "the future" was more like the present.

Select cluster, select cluster type (shining/bright/faded) type in QL, press enter.

For finished items I understand not making it this "easy", but for tradeskill items it really should be. It would clean up the clutter too, only need 1 machine for clusters and the list for every machine would be half as long or better.

They could still make you go to basic for 1-50, advanced for 50-100 and superior for 100-200.

Someone in inventory management needs to tell these computer vendors they are overstocking (and mis-stocking) themselves into bankruptcy

Lets keep to the subject and avoid personal attacks.  BTW lvl 151 isnt a high level trader.  You're just past the half way point to 200.

I had a good last few days.  Just today someone came up to me with all the parts for a QL152 nano (well not all but he tried).  Presto nano came out and he was happy.  Did he tip me because I had QFT and EE and ME and NP and Comp Lit high enough?  Sure why not its alot better than him having to blow 1M+ in IP to raise those up.

Buzzboy @ 11/27/2002 8:07:13 PM (72745):
Prozek - 2 points back:

1. Personally I tip anyone for any buff i get in a city environment be it for equipping or be it prior to doing a mission solo. Obviously if you are teamed in a mission then you dont pay for buffs/healing as you are all helping each other in different ways (Not that I team much as an engi apart from with other engis or MPs - that pet pathing is still too much of a hassle).

2. I will usually refuse a tip if a trade process has required nothing more than me fishing tools out my backpack and using it on an item. Even so I like to be offered/asked or if the player is broke or low level asked nicely and a thankyou said at the end - it is a matter of showing appreciation, rather than people using you like some glorified shop dispenser

On the point which was raised about charging (or charging more)if people want you to do the running round for them I think thats fair. My personal problem with that is it is so hard to value your time. If it will take me an extra 10 minutes running well thats equivalent to 1/6th of a large solo ql 189 mission to me (I'm a level 127 engineer if anyones wondering, and as my partner has a 139 mp so I have mochams on tap I can always get a slayer out and easily solo a 189 mission). That equates to around 1/6th of 400K creds and 2 million xp. The creds is easy but how much value do you put on 350K xp?

If you could charge xp as well as credits (now there's an idea!!!) I wonder how much the people wanting stuff built would pay in creds rather than have to pay 350K xp....

Buzzboy @ 11/27/2002 8:10:39 PM (73629):
Do you have coordinates for the 2 supply masters???

Agreed, now i have to hold on to all the stuff thats not available in stores. Maybe I should start buying up all the spin and glow art there is out there.

Romble @ 11/27/2002 10:55:56 PM (FC want to make it more worthwhile to do tradeskills? 74965):
1. significantly increase the amount of xp given for creation (triple the current amount at least)

2. Add mission booth specific for tradeskills

3. Add unique items to tradeskills

Add a tradeskill only mission booth. At this mission booth you will receive missions that ask you to make certain types of armor/weapon stims etc based on sliders and based on difficulty which would = skill lvl to create. You would have a set amount of time to make and deliver the goods to an NPC located xyxyxy location. The misison reward would be significant XP, significant cash (much more than regular mission to cover costs of creation) and an item.

The item that is created has your name stamp on it so that you could not get someone else to make for you.

Currently, there is no way to gain lvls or incentive to do tradeskills. Only high lvl players who have maxed their combat skills would consider raising tradeskills and then would spend the next 30 lvls gaining ips to do it.

This would allow a tradeskill based Engineer really be an engineer etc

What are your thoughts?

Honeypearl @ 11/28/2002 7:59:31 AM (72745):
Its plain and simple if u dont want to pay for my service go look for someone else. I also pay for my buffs i offer around 100k-200k for essence SFAs, 50ks for ICs FG and ES. I dont ask money making wrangle when im in team mission. besides wrangles is much different than MA crit buffs, enf essence and Doc's heal those are buff that benefits them and can only be done with a click of a button, on wrangles u need to drain and get debuffed for 3 mins.. i dont see any benefits u can get from wrangles unless ur in a team mission with a team-mate with OE pets or OE weapons. Anyways if price are pathetic ppl shouldnt be asking me more for wrangles and my services, i play most of the time with /anon and /afk toggles on. If ppl is gonna be so mean about my offered service and my suggested price i think i gonna stop doing it to other ppl. Im getting a lot more creds blitzing mission rather than dealing with ppl who dont want to pay for the service they want.

Ah, you can get there through the grid. Do you need 250 computer lit? I have 240 so far, 250 next level .

3. Add unique items to tradeskills

Add a tradeskill only mission booth. 
The item that is created has your name stamp on it so that you could not get someone else to make for you.


			
		
	
I think the unique items for tradeskills are well not a good idea.  No drop perhaps from a quest that can be done SOLO (yes funcom SOLO... so we don't have to get 30-40 people to kill The One for some engi armor or whatever profession you are)

Tradeskills mission booths would be nice if your looking for that QL200 piece to add to a sol or TT etc.

yea avalon grid is 450. get dovve's map, the supply masters are at the secondary base in avalon for omni and the northeastern camp in wailing wastes for clan. 
the other quests you get there involve killing the other side guards (lvl 150-200 methinks), pretty tough for a lvl 73 team, due to their high innate resist and nano resist (basically means no calming possible..its pretty hard to calm one of the 150 guys at lvl 180).

Strana @ 11/29/2002 7:47:01 AM (74965):
agree with #1.  Only bad thing might be if they make it too good people with a ton of cash can very quickly level alts by buying trade items from vendors and combining.  It does need to increase though.

Don't know about #2.  Think i would prefer them spend time to add player vendors in for tradeskillers to sell thier wears. 

agree with #3.   I'd like to see more armor upgrades like the CAS armor to start with.



As for E&B comment,  the amount of exp you got from making items was accually very poor and it was even reduced some in the last phase of beta.  Majority of the trade exp came from selling items to vendors including trade supply runs.

... and highlevels with lots of cash have better means of leveling up players then though trade skills. 

Why not let people level though trade skills.  Rubi-Ka is desperately missing people mostly interested in trade skills and socializing.

I know .. someone will say it's stupid that you can become a good fighter through trade skills but isn't it equally stupid that you have to kill things inorder to advance your trade?

Not everyone is proficient in it, not everyone even specializes in it. You gave them sites to look at. okay, but how are they supposed to search through all that stuff to find what they need and if they went to that extent, why are they asking you to assemble the gun? You want people to go do all the work themselves aside from the basic assembly and on top of all that you want a payment of over 50K? Sorry to break it to you but who the heck would actually think a guy like that would be deserving of the money or waste of time talking to them? 
			
		
	
You do realize that most high-level people could easily blitz a mission and make 500k in what, 15 min? Which is close to the time it usually takes to help someone get the parts that are needed for a tradeskill job, swap implants, or find mobs and drain for a wrangle.

That's an example of how much a person's time is worth at the higher levels, and you have to take this into account. If you want a tradeskill person to do such tedious, time-consuming things for you, you'd better be prepared to make it worth the time they spend helping you out.

If you don't want to pay that kind of money, then yes you should be prepared to do some research and get the parts yourself.

Let us start doing tradeskills at level 1, I don't care if it takes longer to level than teaming, make it equivilant to soloing a mob the similar level, or make it cheap enough and valuable enough to make a modest living, like cheaper med kits or something.

An item made with tradeskills should cost 1/4 what the shop charges for an equivilant item at least.

Only way to generate enough action for tradeskillers to make it viable is make it easy to build common items that people buy all the time.

2 things spring to mind here:

1. 1st aid and treatment kits (nano and health)
2. Clusters for implants

If these could be built at 1/2 the cost they are in shops (and to any ql 1-200 you desired - an important point for the 1st aid and treatment kits) they would be in demand. 

Make each one a 2 step process - each step using 2 skills (so making of each requires 4 skills) so people who wanted to do this would have to spend a fair amount of ip to do it. Increase the xp you get from current tradeskilling but maybe not hugely as you'd be doing quite a bit of it.

Hey presto - tradeskilling becomes viable again

All Other Items : Tips Only

note: customer must supply all needed supplies for items created or must reimburse for the cost... and "Tips Only" means "Tip What You Think Is Fair" but obviously if you have a large process or high price item that needs to be made please tip accordingly. And when you bring me a job please tip on an "Item" basis... so a job with 10 items should tip more then one with 2 :-) I NOW ALSO TAKE QL160+ COLDSTONES AS PAYMENT! 

All The Fine Print:
Customers are waited on in a First Come First Serve manner. Most customers are helped and on their way in less then 10 minutes, the better you are prepared (ex. having all the needed parts) the faster you will be on your way happily. 

If you send me a /tell and i don't answer right away or am offline please feel free to send me another /tell a few minutes later. I get many /tells at a time and can get swamped but I will do my best to maintain organization. Also, I do have quite a few alts that I play so you might want to send them /tells also (Svpernaut, Svperstar, Svperhot, Svpergod, Svperman, Svperhate, & Svperfreak).

If you send me a /tell and I am AFK I will do my best to get back to you (if it's still in the chat window) but if I am afk usually just try me a bit later (15-20mins usually). I have a pretty wide hour range that I am usually logged in and playing and I'm sure at one time or another you've seen me spamming the Omni Shopping Channels if you are ever in OT.

PLEASE NOTICE that I WILL NOT go out of my way to make low ql sets of armor (ie Leave Missions/Teams), as I don't make much off of them, and it is basically a waste of my time. So if I'm at a Camelot raid and you get aggitated because I don't have time to make you a ql2 set of Carbonum armor, try seeing it from my point of view. Also, prepared and repeat customers will be waited on faster!!! Time is money, and if you can save me 5 minutes, that is 5 minutes more I can be teaming or helping other customers.

If you have questions about what you need to complete an item instead of asking me first feel free to look at this great website : www.anarchyarcanum.com it's currently where I get all my info and you will probablly get a faster response from it then me, as "Ready" customers come before "Browsing" customers. Once again this helps speed up the process so you and I are both on our ways quicker. I will do my best to answer your questions but please for times sake if you can check the website(s) first it would be much appreciated.

I am a very Trustworthy person who is fairly well know and I'd love to help you. I have created many expensive nanos and items for satisfied customers like Grid Armors, Nullities, Dragon Armors, and Team Beacon Warp. I'm a Vetern of the great and well respected guild HYDRA, and I am proud to represent them and will do my best to please everyone I work with.

Well, that about wraps it up... if you have any questions, comments, praises or complaints please feel free to either post them here or send an ingame /tell to Svpernaut.

See Ya On RK1,
Svpernaut

they need to make tradeskill items seriously bad-ass, enough that there are more tradeskills in demand than nanoprogramming for implant creation.

I think the concept of making **** is cool enough that I made a new alt, explicitely for tradeskills, but for those people that have traders, fixers or other tradeskill heavy professions as their mains, they have to feel gimped in relation to other classes for every IP they sink into their tradeskills.

Svpernaut @ 12/1/2002 9:00:11 AM (76234):
yes, you can make ql200 CAS armor with ql160 notum pieces/chips. you just need to make sure that you have ql180 Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots. so you can have 2 ql160 chips, or a 160 and a 199 and so on and so forth, as long as your Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots are ql180 and your piece of graft/organic armor is atleast ql199.

It's just one more way that FC is forcing ppl into large guilds. As the only tradeskiller in my guild of about 50 ppl (sol trader), I can't make everything that is required for our base and that, imo, is ridiculous. FC should have made engis and traders equally capable of building ql 200 towers, with engis having the edge in higher ql towers, as it should be. But an org should not have to suffer because they don't happen to have a nanomage engineer.

Intrepid @ 12/1/2002 11:36:48 PM (76236):
I am very seriously confused.  

Traders are 100 times better for placing towers then engies.

As for the tradeskill buffing tower.  I thought it starts at ql250 and increased.  Well if infact someone could ever get one together no engie would ever be able to place it making traders more superior to engies in tradeskills then they already are.

Traders BY FAR are the best in towers right now.

Okey i know how to and i just made a ql 17 mp pet from disc 
but i wonder a bit about skills, i used my lvl 22 nanotech and my lvl 11 engineer, this setup seemed easy enough, but i ran into a problem when i needed to combine the Programmed Photon Particle Emitter with the Prepared Program Crystal, this requires both nano programming(that my nano tech is good at) and mechanical engineering that my engineer is good at.

Problem is that neither has both the skills and i think my engi has a blue nano programming skill(at work so not shure), and the nano tech is not that hot on mechanical engineering (now he is but at a nasty cost of 4k ip) 

So is it possible for a single profession to do nano crystals?
shure an atrox enforcer could probably do it but at a high cost 

For me raising nano progging on the engineer is probably easier then raising all the mechanical skills on my nano tech

Tinkertrish @ 12/2/2002 2:52:06 PM (How to make the tradekill towers 76639):
About the tradeskillable defence towers. 
I made one the other day and here it how you do it. First you will need an item called Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots . The seem to only drop from the mobs at the tower camps the clan one is in WW in the far NE corner of the zone and ther omni one is in avalon south of camelot. I dont know the cords but it is a big snow globe looking thing, you can miss it. Once you have your Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots the rest of the stuff can be bought from the tower shops. Simply buy the how to book and follow the instructions. This process relies heavy or EE, Complit and some NP. 

One quick note is that part of the process requires a "Conductor Program" That only come in certain QL's and the Ql of this program defines the Ql of the Turret.  

Their are also defence towers that you cannot buy the Conductor Program for and you cannot buy premade. One of these is the Anti-Aircraft Pulse Turret  a lovely tower that keeps people from scouting out your tower in a yalm. I'm still not sure how to make this one but i would love to know. So if anyone can find more information on this and would care to share it would be much apperciated.

The presonall towers are made the same way as the org towers except they require a Cloud of Infuriated Nanobots. Which you get the same place as the Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots.

My point is that tower reqs should not be so insanely high for high qls that a guild needs to have a few of each prof to be able to do well in building and placing towers. Let's please not get into the 'who is better than who' stuff again.

Elucidate @ 12/2/2002 5:37:42 PM (Searched for this, but can't find an answer.. regarding blood plasma 76696):
What can be made with blood plasma?

So far, the only use I've found is for making a little extra cash from the vending units over the value of Monster Parts.

I like how QL12 BP is worth almost 200 each 

Anyway, is there anything that can be made with BP that's useful? I'm semi-specing in Pharma. Tech.

Also, what's with that grey Leet that gives you that little vial? What's that for?

Autocratt @ 12/2/2002 6:32:57 PM (Carbonum QL and NCU bonus? 76719):
Anyone know the min QL needed for +5 NCU pieces (or all the NCU from 1-10?)

Also, what is the Stamina/Agility req for the min +5 NCU piece. And does the tradeskiller's skill raise the QL of the final pieces?

Thanks so much, need to plan this twinkie out.

RVWinkle @ 12/2/2002 6:55:30 PM (76719):
I don't know the answers to your other questions but I do know that the builder can raise the ql of the armor during the last step, so the completed product usually less than 5 ql higher.

Elucidate @ 12/2/2002 7:10:33 PM (76696):
Wow, that's all?

Seems kinda limited. And expensive. Guess I'll stick to selling BP units.

That little vial that 0wnz (the grey leet) drops is a +2 to Body Dev.. Can those little vials be made with anything?

I bet I could make a nice set of those for myself to wear

Did you try hacking them first?

Metalline @ 12/2/2002 9:05:36 PM (76719):
I am guessing you need ql 101 armor to get a 5 ncu modifier per piece: threadid=49116 

If so, you need plates ql 100 minimum.
Ql 100+ plates increase 1 ql in the making.

Ql 101 Carbonum armor require approximatly 297 stamina and 243 agility (calculated values).

Elbo @ 12/2/2002 9:31:24 PM (75774):
On a separate note.  I can make decent towers hitting 1100 in ME while still having 1K in EE.  Everything is maxed and I've got implants for the rest.   If your on RK2 and you need a tower made msg me and we'll talk.

Mephala @ 12/2/2002 11:09:29 PM (76234):
Krabbus is right it's QL162+ to make QL200 CAS. 

The rule is simple it's 2 time 10%, so for a QL200 Graft armor you need at least a QL180 Inactive OT Metamorphing Liquid Nanobots (10% of 200 is 20 so 200-20 = 180) and to make it active you need 2 Notum fragment and chip in the 10% so QL162 (10% of 180 = 18, 180-18 = 162)

Hamini @ 12/2/2002 11:09:37 PM (75774):

Svpernaut @ 12/3/2002 3:09:17 AM (76256):
i think you made a fool of yourself there Derlyn... like i stated in your other "b|tch thread" and is posted in my tradeskill posts tips should be according to items of value. VT eggs require 6 or 7 implant changes, +80 treatment AND Trader buffs for Engies to complete pre-title level 6. i made you an item that is worth 75 million easy credits, and you tip me 500k. that is less then 1% of the items value. do you tip waiters less then 1%? i think not, if you do you have a lot of urine in your soup. i don't want or need your money, just putting my foot down for all tradeskillers everywhere.

also, you stated that another Tradeskiller said it would be 4 million so you thought that other tradeskillers would do it for 1/8th of that just because we like to? the bottom line is VT eggs are the HARDEST ingame items to make in terms of skills and steps... and your "tip" was more like a slap in the face. i put items on a "Tip" basis to help people who can't afford 4 million, but if they can afford 65 million for parts i would hope they could at least give me 25% of what others charge. i made you a 9 million credit profit and you gave me a 1/18th cut of that for all of MY hard work... thanks for such a great percentage!

Krabbus @ 12/3/2002 10:03:48 AM (76256):
hmm... at level 160 I only need to swap 5 imps (3 for ME for all parts but for the Nano Sensor that needs EE), and a +80 ME buff from a trader - but most tradeskillers may have a stock of Nano Sensors.


A tip would be nice when making a VT since you have to take care of a such valuable item, but when customers ask for prices I usually say tip and they tip what they think is enough. If I at least want 4M for a work I sure don't say tips before I start to do the work, like svpernaut said... 

If you expect to have 4M for your work you don't say tips! It's much better with fixed prices (guess someone is hoping for 10M for assembling a VT when they say tips)


Personally I think NanoPrograms is the hardest thing to make since it requires several skills, and many at the same time. Jewellery only needs ME so that is a bit easier...

Hannibal @ 12/3/2002 11:37:38 AM (74965):
I think increasing xp from tradeskills is a great idea, and i'm just a soldier.  Seems like xp is ok for really low levels, but at higher levels teh xp is completely insignificant.

Elbo @ 12/3/2002 3:42:23 PM (76256):
Hey BrachSon...

Please refer to my post on the lost ones.

If you don't like the price raise your skills and do it yourself. 

If you spent the roughly 750-1M in IP for the ME and EE (not sure if nano programming is needed but I never get bugged for it)  and the hassle of getting a trader to give maestroes and a doc for a +80 your thoughts on what you were offering is well...pathetic.

Have a super day BrachSon...I hope you treat people better ingame than this in the future.

I agree on this.  Lets not get into 'they got it better'.  

Funcom want to respond in some way on this?  Any see a offical response from anyone on why the requirements for QL200 items cannot be done by lvl 200 traders or engineers?

Nivenyrral @ 12/3/2002 4:04:54 PM (76142):
The Guardian Conductors require EE.  Turrets require ME.  Both require some NP to build also.  And the 1173 Req is for a ql200ish one.  I have no idea what a ql250 is going to require, but I am sure that it is unobtainable.  At least as things stand now.

OK... is this item found in the game or not?  I would make this in a instance.  Heck I would make 5 of them and I could then just hit the 1350ish in EE.

I have the STM already 


Edit:

Just looking at this.  It will fit into 5 slots.. Could it be possible to stack these since its only special?  So I could get a extra 250 EE out of 5 of these?

Buzzboy @ 12/3/2002 7:50:03 PM (Suggested reasonable prices for tradeskills and buffs - for discussion 77151):
Given various other threads on here regarding what constitutes reasonable pay for various tradeskills (and buffs as well) I thought it might be useful to have a thread/discussion so everyone who does stuff can post what they regard as reasonable for what they do. I will try and collate responses and edit the initial post periodically to keep it in line with people's responses, so hopefully people who are new to tradeskills know what to charge, and so people who need tradeskillers or buffs have an idea of what is reasonable (or can be pointed here if their offer takes the mickey).

Please try not to make this a discussion on payment versus tips and the meaning of the word tip, as there are other threads ongoing around those issues. I also know we all do things cheaper for guild-mates, regular customers etc etc and this list is not to meant to include such factors. So just post a list of what you charge or would expect as a reasonable tip (including charge/ql or charge/skill needed) for any of the following (although the list is just as a starting point representing common requests, other buffs and items are welcome to be included). Please note that tradeskill costs are intended to be where all non-reusable parts are brought to you by the person paying.

The starting values listed are based either on other recent posts/threads I have read, what I'd expect myself for those cases where I have characters who can do them, or what I'm used to tipping/paying for things I've needed multiple times - feel free to argue with them - that after all is the point of the discussion!

Iron circle. . . really depends on the character. If you fly up in a yalm and your level 20 character has a full suit of omni-pol on, I expect something more that "Thx" and you running off.
If it's an obviously non-twinked character, a "Thank you!" is sufficient.

yes thats a very nice tower.  A engie would never be able to plant.  And no one would ever be able to make.  Those towers are only available through making them which would require like 1500 EE or whatever?

i never in my right mind asked 4 million to make a VT egg, and never would... i guess you misunderstood Krabbus. Derlyn /telled me asking to get a VT egg done and said that Superslang quoted her a price of 4million to assemble. Now Superslang is a level 200 engie with nothing better to do and has thousands of customers lined up so if someone doesn't want to pay 4 million that is no harm to him. Now i don't disagree that 4 million for making a VT egg is a bad price, i just take a different approach to tradeskilling. For everything other then armor creation i leave it on a "tip" basis because i want to bring tradeskills to the masses, not just those who are rich.

My problem with Derlyn's approach was the way she handled the entire situation. She KNEW i was making her a profit of 9 million credits over the price of her parts and she offered me a 7% cut on that and less then 1% tip on the items value. When she asked how much i charged i said like i always do for high priced items for a "generous tip." the bottom line is i run into people ALL DAY who don't take into account just how hard being a successful tradeskiller is without gimping yourself completely in the process. some say "don't ask for tips set a certain rate" but i'm not going to hurt the majority of my customers because 20% of people are freaking morons and cheapskates, and the way i rid myself of those people is a nice "good luck to you" and politely /ignore them... until of course they sadly try to flame me.

Svpernaut @ 12/3/2002 10:11:30 PM (77168):
i easily got into my ql133 adaga equipped which has a Vehicle Air Requirement of 599, and i am only using the bright VA ear cluster (ql200). i figure i could easily get into a ql160 Stiletto at level 180ish (166 now) without gimping myself and i am a nanomage engineer with a Blue Vehicle Air skill. at the TL5 cap it is easy to equip because you have 80k of IP each level with very few places to put it. it is definately only for high TL5 of TL6 players though.

132 wrangle:                                 100K <-- ermm i ask 1k per point on this coz u need to zone 2 times inside the backyard to the park drain mobs, recharge ask if they are rdy.. wrangle then zone 2 times again back to backtard then to tir rock, but since the grid is relocated outside the south gate and mobs are everywhere i say 100k is fair.
Maestos: 100k (most traders needs to drain for this)
Offensive steamroller: i offer 100-200k on this
Total focus: dunno what this buff do
Riot control: i offer 100k-200k but most of the time soldier do it for me for free lols dunno why.
Ranged energy weapon mastery: no idea
Assault rifle mastery: no idea
Rifle mastery: no idea too
Pistol mastery: im dumb i dont usually ask for soldier buffs

			
		
	
The consequences of asking "tips" is ppl might give u 5k for 132 wrangle which is not as easy as right-clicking the button like other buffs do.

QuickTrick @ 12/4/2002 3:05:49 AM (How do you build a Control Tower from scratch? 77306):
I am desperatly trying to figure out how you build control towers (and I don't mean buying a premade one and setting it up). There are a lot of intermediate zones that the Tower Store just doesn't cover in its premade tower terminal.

I am also aware that there is an instruction booklet that tells you how to build Service Towers. This is also not what I want to know. I am looking to find out how to acquire Control Towers and Land Control Towers that aren't available in the store.

Does anyone out there know?

Any insight would be valued.

This depends largely on circumstance...

If these guys are teamed with you, then 'no' I wouldnt expect to pay for buffs. However if I'm taking time out of these guys game time then its only fair to expect to have to compensate them (moreso if they need to drain, implants swap or something first).

On the other hand, some of your examples are skills the player would have had to increased to play their profession, and many of these buffs would be used by the player on a daily basis. The difference with alot of tradeskills is that they are optional in that a player does not need to raise them to play his profession, nor would he use them in day-to-day play.

The other thing you fail to acknowledge is this. Take an Engineer for example, at certain points in the game he will need to get MP and/or Trader buffs to keep his pet at an acceptable level. These buffs are often charged for (for whatever reason) but since Engineers have no buffs that are desired by the community (i.e. nothing they can charge for) the only way they can make money from other players is via tradeskills

Funcom: please stop making stuff for shadowlands before shadowlands comes out(can anyone say clip junkie, or izgimmer's living codex?), spend your coding time making useful stuff, or keep it out of current builds.  All it can do is ADD problems, and piss off your current customers.

Whealer @ 12/4/2002 4:17:49 PM (72745):
Now this may seem like an obvious statment but I think it needs to be said.  In the case of the nano crystal mentioned above even if the person where to tip the tradeskill person 500K for the making of the crystal they are still not spending nearly the amount that the crystal would cost in its completed form.  This said in essence you are getting the crystal at a bargin discount rate.  Granted if you are only having it made to turn around and sell it to a shop the cost may not be worth it but in that instance you never really needed the crystal in the first place so there should be no complaints.

It all boils down to supply and demand.  A lvl 200 Atrox solider is able to raise there tradeskills up to 651 without implants it is there choice not to follow that path.  While 651 in tradeskills may not build every item it will build most level items that could be used by them.  

Bottom line is don't expect people to respect you if you don't respect them also.

Pays007 @ 12/4/2002 5:03:11 PM (76236):
Im willing to bet they will lower the min QL of the tradeskill towers when SL comes out. WOuld allow for higher tradeskills to make higher QL towers....?

Hodelay @ 12/4/2002 6:59:18 PM (77306):
As of right now I believe there is no way of making your own Control Tower.  The reason you see people with wierd QL Towers is because if you check the shop they will have....

QL 10
QL 50
QL 75
QL 100
QL 150
QL 200
QL 250
QL 300

Then there will be ONE control tower that has a QL that ranges from 1-300.  So you just have to check the tower booths everynow and then to see if they have a QL that fits your needs.

Hope that helps

SanFranFitz @ 12/4/2002 7:08:33 PM (question about making Service Towers... 77559):
The manual in the towers shop says that to make a Service Tower I need a Service Tower shell (got that), a library (got that) and a tuner to use on the library (don't have that). Can I find these "tuners" in the Tools kiosk in a general shop?

Thanks for any help.

Ya knowI agree with you completely.   I do the exact same thing except I don't give them a good luck to you.. I say something like Next time you want something done your going to have to find someone else for being so CHEAP. (then I explain what the requirements are and how much IP I've blown on it) and say they are on my ignore.  Depending on how many people I've got on ignore from a guild will decide on if I will ever do any work for any of them again.  I've messaged a few guild leaders telling them in detail why I won't help them ever again.

Hi,
  You get the MultiPurpose Tuner from completing a quest for the Supplier at the Clan/Omni Base.  You just need to start the dialogue with him to get the quest then hand him a GiftWrap Basket (these are found in abunance in chests for Avalon missions).  And presto you have your very own MultiPurpose Tuner.

Buzzboy @ 12/4/2002 9:47:15 PM (77151):
Thanks for the long and helpful post back. Having talked to a couple of guildmates they seem to agree that low level buffs (like feline grace, enhanced senses, pistol mastery etc) they tend to be happy to do for free as long as character isn't too high level. Even if the character is high level they thought about 20K was adequate.

Surely some of the other high level tradeskillers and buffers out there can add what they think is reasonable too - whether they agree with above or not??

Buzzboy @ 12/4/2002 9:54:28 PM (77151):
Oh and just as a note - the extreme prejudice is an engi buff for +120 to grenade and pistol - and not many engineers tend to have it due to the cost of developing SI and PM that high. 

The take the shot buff tends to be needed by mid level non-agent characters trying to equip the "TIM scope". The one time I needed this I did offer 200k as tip but the agent concerned insisted on doing it for free (big thanks).

Also I do have a doc alt who can do SFA and personally am quite happy when someone offers a 100k tip for doing that - to be offered 200k for it is extremely rare in my experience.

I'd also be interested Honey on what you think is reasonable for multiple Maestros' as in when someone wants 3 different ones at once (as you can manage with a single drain) - would you expect more as a tip than for one or not? Certainly my quoted ideal tip for Mocham's of 50K each is based largely round the fact most people want 2 at a time - I do have an MP alt who does Mooches and would actually consider the 100k adequate as a tip even if person wanted 3 or 4 all at once.

Most of the people who want thier IDs converted to nanocrystals are those rare type nanos like nullity sphere and grid armors. I think its fair enough to pay the tradeskillers to convert it for 500k.

to make a 200 turet you need 1400 in mech engi and 1100 in EE

if you can make that, your my fekin hero

Obviously you don't make nano crystals.  If people only wanted the rares made into nanos like the ones you listed above most people would do one of those about once a week depending on how often you are on etc.

I get requests every week for LW and KPT and well the whole gambit from QL90-215.  Mostly fixer nanos lately.

Elbo @ 12/5/2002 3:24:53 AM (77151):
Extreme prejudice: 

If you need a +120 pistol/gernade buff then you can afford at least 120K.  But those engineers who have raised the nice blue skills up this high 120K should be considered 'base' level.

See the engineers forum for a list of who can selfcast.

i'm a soldier, i do all buffs for free on clanners if i can self cast em and u come to me (dont expect me to come to you, i wont do it). If i cant selfcast it, u wont get the buff, except if u bring a trader or MP along that will buff me (u give him the tips then...)

BTW total focus is a self-only buff...
OS i cant self cast yet, but i wouldnt ask tips for it, a thx will do (i wont decline tips though :P)

hope that will help, 

PS: in the last 4 or 5 months i didnt tip for ANY buffs, its simple: You buff me and i buff you :P (rrf and OS is always welcome i noticed)

Afelia @ 12/5/2002 4:37:52 PM (72745):
Building Nano Crystals is such a pain and takes so much time for high-QL that it's only far to pay well for it.

I did a ql 159 last weekend. (NS2). I spent 3 hours, making 5 implant setups and spent 80k IP.  Then I spent 2 hours getting enough bufs to put my armour back on. I could get 1 level and some millions of cash/loot in that time. Ok, next NS2 will require 30-60 minutes + getting the bufs needed. If I have to tip for the bufs, that will cost me 3-400k alone.

Naturally, I wouldn't do this for free unless the owner was a fellow guild member.

I got this policy:
If I can do the tradeskill/buf by just getting stuff from bags/bank and I'm not in a mission/hurry, I'll do it for Tips.

If I have to drain for the bufs or change implants for the tradeskill, you better offer som cash.

Yes, I will shop for parts for making NanoCrystals but you have to bring your own Carbo Sheets.

Ghir @ 12/5/2002 5:36:08 PM (77921):
According to this post, you can expect to pay around 1k/QL of the finished Nano assuming you provide all expendable parts (around 60k tip + parts cost for GA Mk I).

Best thing is to ask the Nanoprogrammer ahead of time to find out what they need you to buy, what QL it needs to be, and how much of a tip/charge they expect.  Less surprises = good

Intrepid @ 12/5/2002 6:41:14 PM (77921):
!k/ql is not a very good rule to go by at all.  For a nano like that though where it is that low in QL a 100k tip would be fine.

But for anything over ql150-160 you should start shelling out big tips cause it takes multiple implants swaps trader buffs doc buffs sometimes MP buffs for a engie to be able to make those.  for a ql212 nano most people expect a few mil tip.  If i have to make a ql212 ILW and someone tips me 60k they immediately go onto my ignore list.

Elbo @ 12/5/2002 7:19:29 PM (77921):
If your a GA less Fixer then 100K would be fine.  If you have GA and your going to sell this puppy bumping it up to 250K wouldnt be a bad idea :-)  You can afford it with the 40-50M this will bring in.

Nivenyrral @ 12/5/2002 8:50:44 PM (77995):
If I remember correctly you just combine that with some polychromatic nanobots to perform the first step of construction.

Second step is to add the Corruption Program.

Third step is to add the Bio Plate(or whatever it is called).

Krabbus @ 12/5/2002 8:57:08 PM (77995):
didn't work to just combine the nanobots  The building kit can be any QL, right?

ahh, my fault, I was messing around with the turret nanobots

Hodelay @ 12/5/2002 9:25:06 PM (77995):
Here is step by step process for a Guardian (using Corruption as example)......

Parts you will need:
Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots
Guardian Conductor Building Kit
Conductor of Corruption Program
HSR Compressed Regenerating Bioplate 

The FINAL QL of the tower will be the QL of the Conductor Program.
Parts must be within 10% of the part you are adding it to.

Step 1
Add Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots to Guardian Conductor Building Kit will get you.....
Guardian Conductor Controller

Step 2
Add Guardian Conductor Controller to Conductor of Corruption Program will get you....
Conductor of Corruption Contoller

Step 3
Add HSR Compressed Regenerating Bioplate to Conductor of Corruption Controller will get you......
Guardian Conductor of Corruption

And what about improving weapons?

Svpernaut @ 12/5/2002 11:35:39 PM (78023):
these seem to be yet another tradeskill item that would be a b|tch to get on... go figure. i'm a level 169 nanomage engineer with shades of Luc and a VT egg and i would have trouble getting these on with a psychic requirement of 605. i'm breed capped in intelligence and i couldn't get that high in Intel without my VT egg and Shades of Luc and i have 2 of 3 QL200 Intel implants in... so you have to feel sorry for JoBlo who would have these pants but wasn't nanomage or couldn't afford an egg. Funcom needs to give more tradeskill buffing armors like the Engineer constructions sleeves and stop with all of these ungodly requirements.

on a side note, these pants would be a dream for a TL5 capped engineer trying to squeeze into selfcasting Slayer Transference pre TL6, the Nanoskill boosts of +6 are a nice addition... however, trying to find room for the Psychic clusters in your implants would be a chore to say the least.

Svpernaut @ 12/5/2002 11:43:56 PM (78019):
i don't know the exact numbers, but i believe it has a lot to do with both your Profession and Breed. At TL5 Cap my Nanomage engineer has Green Tradeskills capped at 690 and the Blue/Green Tradeskills capped at about 680. I'm sure there is a better system for finding out, but I don't run the numbers just giving you a heads up on what you can really expect. I'd imagine that I will be breed capped at around 715 and 725 in those skills early into TL6.

Buzzboy @ 12/5/2002 11:48:24 PM (77151):
My impresion was that, other than activating pepper pistols from weapons receptacles and converting chemical maussers, not that much weapon improvement went on....

The GA1/NS1 costs are being discussed in another thread at the moment and the current suggestion on there seemed to be that it depended partly on whether it was something being converted so the person could upload it themselves who was paying (in which case it was at or only marginally over the usual fee - 100K for GA1 was mentioned), or whether it was to sell on (in which case a larger tip would be expected - 250K was mentioned for GA1 in this context)

when taking rare nanos being made into consideration you aren't just going to hand them over to just any tradeskiller. i'm sure that if you have an ID (instruction disc) for a rare nano ranging in price from 15 million to 700 million credits that you want someone who is trustworthy, and i believe you should tip more for the fact that a tradeskiller has a long history of satisfied customers. i believe that a good name in the business deserves a decent tip in return because you KNOW that you will see your prized item again in a much more usefull form.

lets be honest, if you buy or find a GA, Nullity, Team Beacon, or Little Nuke you have an item that is worth a lot of credits wether you sell it or use it for yourself. an ID is useless not in nano form and so you won't be a god in PVM or PVP without the help of a tradeskiller who puts IP into tradeskills and gimping him/herself to never be able to PVP.

remember this; if you come prepared (having all the correct parts including the rock of correct QL) your tradeskiller will be much happier then having to track all of this stuff down because you are too lazy or impatient to do it yourself. so if you come partless, especially rockless you should tip at least 50% more then what you normaly would. let me tell you now, that NO tradeskiller enjoys hunting for carbonrich rocks... it is NOT enjoyable and is extremely time consuming and we would much rather you go out of your way then us, seeing as we are helping you.

now i set a "tip" value on all of my tradeskills except armor making... and i would certainly hope that if you found a GA that you would still have many credits seeing how you paid nothing for it, and if you bought GA i would certainly hope that you would take into count the construction process in your blitzing for credits frenzy. 500k or a million credits is NOTHING in this economy, especially when someone is making you a nano that is worth 100-700 times that.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 12:34:11 AM (Stiletto Construction Questions. 78078):
Highorbit and I are working on building my Stiletto...  I have all the parts needed in the appropriate QLs..  Except the NotuComm Mesh..  Now.. Within the Stiletto Building kit, it states that the Cold Stones need to be reprogrammed...  We're assuming this is why we can't combine the Cold Stones with the NotuComm Wire... Because we haven't reprogrammed them..  Anyone have any ideas?

Svpernaut @ 12/6/2002 1:08:33 AM (78078):
cold stones are a "gem" just like a ruby or gold sphere and need to be cut with a gem cutter to be put into jewelry... this may be what you need to do, try cutting them with a gem cutter and see if that helps.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:09:25 AM (78078):
Already have done so...  No go.

Hodelay @ 12/6/2002 1:15:10 AM (78078):
Hi,
  You need to use the Nano Programming Interface on the ColdStones before attaching it the wire.

However........the Stiletto is NOT_IN_THE_GAME...er I mean "bugged" at this moment.  You cannot combine the the final completed NotuComm Wire to create the NotuComm Mesh.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:19:38 AM (78078):
Damn.. That's what I thought, and was afraid of..  It dsoesn't work on cut stones..

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:22:06 AM (78078):
50 mil wasted on a stupid mistake..  Having the stones cut..

Svpernaut @ 12/6/2002 1:22:22 AM (78078):
so what you are saying is DO NOT cut your coldstones, but rather us an NPI on them. ouch, hope you didn't cut them all Knight. i would have done 1 and tried... doh!

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:23:07 AM (78078):
That I did...    Back to square one, because I went on a vehicle buying spree..  ..and now I'm broke.. 

Bought:

Manta A.V.
Manta Neo-Concept
Manta Sportline

along with my Stiletto and I already had an Adaga Brutal.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:30:37 AM (78078):
Ah well..  This shall henceforth be known as Knightwulf's Folly...  

Also interesting to note..  I wasted 16 mil earlier by buying two new paintjobs for my Adaga...  An Elegante and a Brutal...  Now..  I've already painted my Adaga with a Brutal, but I wanted to try out the Elegante...  ...and bought another Brutal in case I hated the Elegante.  WHOOPS!  Can't repaint an Adaga like you can a standard Yalm.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 1:39:47 AM (78078):
Wait...  Thinking here...  You stated that the Mesh wasn't in the game yet.. Sooo..  Does that meant that it would give the 'cannot combine' message when processing the Stones as well?  (Hopeful pleading...)

Hodelay @ 12/6/2002 1:54:15 AM (78078):
Unfortunately this is already in the game....NotuComm Circuitry with One Sensor

Sorry to hear about your mishap.

Svpernaut @ 12/6/2002 2:20:55 AM (78078):
speaking of adaga paintjobs... i have a QL133 adaga that i love, but am i the only one that thinks the paintjobs for these awesome yalms looks like total and complete crap? sorry if you like your brutal look, but i myself think the lousy resolution images of an atrox and a solitus female on a crappy "flame job" on an ugly blue background are just ghetto. on the other hand... i really like the standard adaga look and don't plan on changing mine, but if there were "color" changes like the gold and the red of the original yalms i'd probably do that to my adaga.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 2:31:50 AM (78078):
Personally, I love the look of the Brutal, save for the Atrox...    It's just vicious looking..  But yeah, if I could get the 'Trox off my Yalm, I'd be a happy Fixer..  (Enter: The Stiletto) 

(By the by... The Brutal isn't blue like the Elegante..  It's primarily black with red/orange/yellow flamejob)

Xolinlevh @ 12/6/2002 4:17:03 AM (78078):
few quick questions before i try to make a new yalm....
1. how many cold stones are needed for the Stiletto?
2. if u buy the new paint for the regular yalms does it change the air req? and can u change the paint again and again?
3. do any of the parts/paint drop in miss (boss, mob, chest, miss reward)?
4. what skills are needed to do the painting of the regular yalm?
5. to make the Stiletto from the kit, what skills are needed?


well thats all for now, once i manage to get another 119 mill i can buy the dang stuff for a Stiletto!

Skara @ 12/6/2002 5:18:38 AM (72745):
Really not trying to stir anything up here as I can see this is a hot topic, but I really wish there was some kind of standardization.

The economy on both dimensions is completely out of sync with each other and dimension one is so incredibly borked that it isn't funny (why any item a character below lvl 50 would use can possibly cost several 100K when the only way that character could get that kind of money while the item could actually benefit them is to have creds muled to them is beyond me). This makes it difficult to know how much to offer for anything at any given moment.

I run into this with "tips". I wrote "tips" because many don't mean a tip they mean they want to get paid but for some reason refuse to state their price. I had one guy tell me he usually gets more money that way . I also run into this with people selling on the channels who refuse to state their price. 

I have offended people with a tip and I have made people ecstatic with a tip. 

Don't get me wrong, tradeskills are very valuable and if you have spent the IP you deserve to be rewarded for that as well as your time and effort to build the item. I disagree though with getting offended at not receiving enough of a "tip". If you have an amount in mind, state your price. If I have it I will pay, if not I will say that I will get back to you when I have the creds.

I won't say anyone isn't entitled to their feelings about something, but I think it is kind of fubar to refuse to state a set price, say you are working for "tips", then get offended when the person doesn't offer the amount you hoped for. The amount you hoped for should be stated as your set price, otherwise you are asking ME to put a value on YOUR time and that is very difficult for me to do accurately. I don't want to way over pay and bankrupt myself when you would be very happy with half what I tip, but I also don't want to offend and get ignored because I way under pay.

What is so difficult about stating your price?

Jica @ 12/6/2002 5:46:05 AM (76256):
This is the reason I keep a pricelist on the forums. I refer to it if people ask. However, special deals are somtimes made and if so, I stick to the decided price.

Jica @ 12/6/2002 6:06:02 AM (76142):
Slaggie doesn't have monopoly ;)

I can get around 1215 ME and 1250 EE (absolute approx max) using all the items at my disposal. I'm still trying to work around the prices. Many tip very very generously (around 8-10 mil per tower, not including parts), so that's where I've put my starting point.

Jica's Tradeskills

And QL200 towers requires same skill to create as a QL 250 tower (still working on verifying conductors fully). I've tested this with turrets only so far, and the final QL depends on the QL HSR Bioplate you add to the turret. Hence a QL 205 base adding a QL 250 Armor plate will result in a QL 250 turret.


EDIT: fixed a nasty type. 1215 ME and not 1225 ;)

SUPERSLAG @ 12/6/2002 6:46:08 AM (Slaggie's rk1 Construct tower Shop ql 150-200 78173):

Jica @ 12/6/2002 7:45:37 AM (76236):
I am still doing some tests, which is a bit slow since I haven't been able to get Notum Wars yet.

I know this for sure tho. Building custom turrets only needs a certain amount of ME. The final QL depends on the QL of the HSR Bioplate which is combined with the turret. So you can make a QL200 base and then add a QL250 plate and get a QL250 turret out of it. 

If the conductors work based on the QL of the Program used, then we won't see more than QL 210s of those or thereabout.

Jica @ 12/6/2002 8:03:50 AM (Tower Construction & Other Tradeskill Services (Atlantean) 78187):
Hello everyone! 

Time has come to reopen my tradeskills 'for hire' after nearly three months break. 

Following is a list of most of the items I can make, as well as a guiding pricelist. 
Note that some of the services are tips only, and some have fixed amounts and often per quality level of a given item. 

NOTE: You, the customer, will have to supply all the necessary parts for each piece of item of any type if so stated. The list should be very clear. Any doubts or questions, feel free to send me a tell. 

- Tower Creation 
- - Turrets/Conductors QL 1-99 [2k per QL of final tower] 
- - Turrets/Conductors QL 100-149 [4k per QL of final tower] 
- - Turrets/Conductors QL 150-179 [10k per QL of final tower] 
- - Turrets/Conductors QL 180-194 [20k per QL of final tower] 
- - Turrets/Conductors QL 195-~210 [30k per QL of final tower] 
- - Turrets QL 206-250 [40k per QL of final tower] ~~ Supply the required parts from the towershops as well as the appropriate cloud of nanobots (Turrets need Infuriated nanobots and Conductors need Polymorphic nanobots). For turrets you will need to complete a weapon-quest for a cold laser gun, which is currently the only one that can be made due to requirements. 
After doing several towers these facts can be made clear: Turrets' final QL depends on the QL of the HSR armor plating used in the last step. Conductors' final QL depends on the QL of the Program, which is used in the process. Due to the very high tradeskill requirements, my personal average max is around QL 210 (maybe a bit higher/lower depending on the type). 

NOTE: Creating high QL towers is definately not easy and hence the pricing (QL 200s mostly require 1100-1200 Electrical Engineering). 

- Armor Creation 
- - Carbonum Plate Armor [1k per QL per Piece] ~~ Supply Curved Carbonum Sheets. One per piece. 
- - Bronto Hide Armor [1k per QL per Part] ~~ Supply Bronto Hide and Tanning Acid. One per piece. 
- - Dragon Armor [2m per Part] 
- - Mantis Armor [1k per QL per Part] 
- - CAS Armor [2k per QL per Piece] ~~ Supply two Notum Fragments/Chips and a piece of Graft/Organic armor for each piece. Also supply a Vial per piece of armor. Contact me if any questions. 
- - Modernized ICC Cloaks [2k per QL of Cloak] ~~ Supply one Notum Fragment/Chip and the ICC Cloak you want altered. Also supply a Vial per piece of armor. Contact me if any questions. 
- - Barter Armor [2k per QL per Piece] ~~ Supply two Notum Fragments/Chips and a piece of Nano Armor for each piece of armor. Also supply a Vial per piece of armor. Contact me if any questions. 

- Nanocrystals ~~ Supply the Instruction Disc and a Carbonrich Rock of the ql of the disc or greater. Note that the rock will be the measurement of the QL of which the price is assumed. 
- - Instruction Discs QL 1-100 [1k per QL] 
- - Instruction Discs QL 101-180 [2k per QL] 
- - Instruction Discs QL 181-215 [4k per QL] 

- Implant Assembling ~~ NOTE: I do not build sets below QL 125. 
- - Single Implant(s) [Tips] 
- - Full sets [Minimum tip is 200k] 

- Hacking 
- - Hacking Items [1k per QL of the item] 
- - Stripping Implants [1k per QL of the implant] ~~ Note that Refined Implants can not be cleaned. 

- Virral Triumvirate Eggs [4 mil per VT Egg] ~~ Supply a Raw Mantis Egg, 3x QL 190-225 Gold Items/Ingots, 3x QL 190+ Soul Fragments and some QL 190+ Robot Junk/Nano Sensor. 

- Treatment Library (Doctor/Universal) [Tips] ~~ Supply a Pharmatech Tutoring Device and a Portable Surgery Clinic, both of the same QL as you wish the final product to be of. 

- Implant Disassembly Clinic [Tips] ~~ Supply an Implant Disassembly Unit (from fixer shop) and a Portable Surgery Clinic, both of the same QL as you wish the final clinic to be of. 

- Assemble Weapons [Tips] ~~ Supply all the parts needed. 

- Overtune Tank Armor [Tips] 

- Flesh Hoods [1k per QL of the Monster Part] ~~ Supply a Monster Part of that QL you wish the hood to be of. 

- Building Coffee Machines [Tips] 

- Robot Brains [Tips + Part Expenses] ~~ Supply some Robot Junk/Nano Sensor of the QL you wish the Robot Brain to be of. 

- Jobe Clusters & Implants
- - 1000+ Pharmatech Skill needed [1 mil per cluster]
- - 1000- Pharmatech Skill needed [500k per cluster]

NOTE: I cannot do implants which require above 1000 Psychology.


Note that I can make anything in the game. There may be things 'missing' from the list atm., but that doesn't mean I don't make them. This list will get updated from time to time. 

Here's a list of how high I can max. get my skills. Note that it's only one skill at a time. It's merely to use as a referance as of what is possible to get as an engineer (level 200 solitus, 100% tradeskill optimized). It's made from using all the items I can have my hands on for each skill. Use it as a guideline please. 

Mechanical Engineering: 1215 
Electrical Engineering: 1250 
Quantum Forcefield Technology: 1229 
Weapon Smithing: 1185 
Pharmacological Technology: 1165 
Nanoprogramming: 1379 
Computer Literacy: 1285 
Chemistry: 1097 
Break & Entry: 1067 


If you wish to use my services, please leave me a tell ingame with Jica (/tell Jica). I do not respond to 'junk' messages. If I'm offline, leave a message stating what you need and/or your question, and I will get back to you as soon as possible.

For a level 200 solitus engineer, I capped around lvl 199 and ended in most around 732/733 except Pharmatech and Psychology. Though I think they are a bit higher than they should be because I have a few intelligence implants.

Jica @ 12/6/2002 8:17:17 AM (77526):
It is for the engineering pistol yes. I'm going to ask in the Professionals forum for more info on the status of the quest and pistol and when it's supposed to be released. A developer already posted about it in the engineer forum (expected release in patch 14.8), but I'd like a status report on it anyways.
I am eagerly awaiting it as well as many other crafters =)

Jica @ 12/6/2002 8:41:58 AM (76813):
Actually, the amount of tradeskills needed depends solely on the QL of the gun you are trying to mount. And some of those are only available in one QL, no lower or higher. 
Only one possible to make atm., is the Cold Laser turret, which is QL205 by default.

I know its easy to earn a few millions here and there, but there are people that play maybe once every 2 weeks and dont bother to get "alot" of credits for their rare nanos....hehe

But if i find GA one day, ill contact u Svpernaut and ill tip you well for it......cause i know you deserve it

ethernal3 @ 12/6/2002 2:04:16 PM (Stop asking engineers to build stuff. lol 78250):
Obviously Funcom never intended us to do tradeskills, being that there is a trader-only tower (it starts at ql 250+) to add tradeskills. 

+25 to all (and +75 to evades, which, never hurt too much I suppose.) tradeskills. 

So um.. yea... That more or less equals out the "uber items" we might be able to get in a hundred years, and then they can still cast masterols.. yipeeeeeee.

Nivenyrral @ 12/6/2002 2:05:25 PM (76142):
I went all out last night and managed a 1184 ME and a 1222 EE.  I need to test out that bioplate thing Jica, that would make me very happy if I could do a 250.  This was with a lot of engie specific and general tradeskill boosting items though. 

I can get quite a bit higher in one more level as I will be able to use much higher ql tutoring devices.  The above was acheived with no IP in tutoring, and thus by using low ql tutors.  I figure I will be able to max out next level at around 1230 ME and 1270 EE. 

The whole thing was a major pain though, as bad as making high ql nanocrystals.  And I can only gear up for one or the other of these at a time.  EE is higher because the clusters don't conflict with int clusters, whereas the ME ones do.  It also took the org contract for ME(ql248) or EE(ql245), and the one for INT(QL232) to do. Just from the contract standpoint this is not for everyone.  I am just lucky enough to be President of a guild with enough tower levels to put in two contracts that size.

The new code we need to make it work is requested, and at the moment it still seems it will be in 14.8.

That's the status - no guarantee, but it looks promising.

Knightwulf @ 12/6/2002 5:00:40 PM (78078):
1.) 18 of QL160+
2.) No.  Yes.
3.) No (Save for Cold Stones, which is the only place to acquire them)
4.) No idea, but I'm under the impression that a level 10 player could do it.
5.) Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, bu the Stiletto doesn't become NODROP until you use the registrar on it, so you can hand it over to a Tradeskiller you trust to assemble it, and then you can register it.

JimSalabim @ 12/6/2002 5:12:59 PM (78078):
Also interesting to note.. I wasted 16 mil earlier by buying two new paintjobs for my Adaga... An Elegante and a Brutal... Now..

Can't repaint an Adaga like you can a standard Yalm.
			
		
	
Hold on to that paint. We're planning to make it possible to repaint a "brutal" with an "elegante" motif and vice versa. Perhaps also make it possible to remove the paint entirely. Currently scheduled for 14.8.

Lemain @ 12/6/2002 6:48:55 PM (need advice with certain items: Carbon rocks + notum chips 78322):
Hi!

Since ages I own truckloads of carbon rich rocks of ql 200+,  notum chips (ql ~130) and notum nuggets (ql 153).

Everyday I try to find somebody, who knows, what to do with that stuff. Nobody seems to know or to be willing to help.

Maybe here somebody can give me an advice, what I can do with it. As an MA I don't skill trade skills, so I am kinda helpless.

Only thing I know is, that those items MUST be of value, because everytime I find one, at least one team mate sends me a "gratz" or "lucky guy".

Thelcia @ 12/6/2002 7:47:26 PM (76142):
Just to clarify a couple quick things:

For the guardian conductors, the ql is determined by the ql of the program. This is also the tradeskill instinsive step. The equation for this step is: 5.75xQL EE, 4xQL NP, 4xQL CL. The last step to add the bioplate is 4xQL ME. All QL's are the QL of the program and do not relate to the QL of the bioplate. Thus, the top QL that could be acheived atm lies somewhere between 210 and 215 I think.

I do not know the full equation for the turrets, but the main step of attaching the gun requires 5.75xQL ME and something like 4.5 or 4.75xQL WS. The QL is the QL of the gun, or 205 for the cold laser. The last step of adding the bioplate determines QL of the final tower, but I do not know what this process requires. I would not be surprised if it was possible to make 250's though.

Hodelay @ 12/6/2002 7:50:17 PM (78078):
Maybe Stiletto in 14.8? PRETTY PLEASE!!!! 

You can use ql 144 ColdStones if you use the ql 160 NotuComm Wire.  Also before you start gathering parts for your Stiletto make sure you will be able to equip it.  The Vehicle Air Reqs are pretty insane.  920 VA for the ql 160.

good to know Jim, will there be solid color paint jobs for the adagas like the regular yalms or do we have to live with a big atrox on the front of the yalm?

Svpernaut @ 12/6/2002 8:06:59 PM (78322):
notum nuggets are worthless. and everyone and their brother gets ql200+ carbonrich rocks in missions... but your notum chips are worth some cash.

Loveyou @ 12/6/2002 8:48:03 PM (78078):
it requires 36 cold stones unlike in the description, I think they will fix the description soon.

and yes the ql of cold stones has to be 144 or higher .. if you build a ql 160 stiletto .

If you have any other questions you can contact me since I just finished my stiletto . Thanks to all my lovely guild members  ty ty ty  and Thanks to Lucien for telling me about this desc being wrong (although it took 4 days )

Hodelay @ 12/6/2002 9:33:08 PM (78078):
Okay Okay before you answer I think I figured it out..........

Looking at the DataBase there are Double NotuComm Circuitry and Quadruple NotuComm Circuitry but no Triple Circutiry nor Pentawhateveryoucallit Circuitry.

So my guess is you need to combine Double Circuitry with Double Circuitry to make Quadruple then another Double to Quadruple to make finished NotuComm Mesh.   

Right?????

Miniexplicit @ 12/6/2002 9:41:09 PM (78078):
Yeah, I think thats the answer

Instead of 3 NotuComm Wires you need 6 NotuComm wires.

5.) Electrical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering, bu the Stiletto doesn't become NODROP until you use the registrar on it, so you can hand it over to a Tradeskiller you trust to assemble it, and then you can register it.

so if they come to me to get their egg built,  and i get a 400k tip,   i am not a happy engie,  sure 400k is a lot to some people,  but if you just spent 60 mil on frags,  have the decency to tip the builder and not insult him/her with change

I never charge to buff people, never have and never will.

I charge tips for some services, but if someone asks me to build one implant at tir grid, then sure I'll do it for free. All depend on time, amount and workload. 

Close friends and guildies get items made for free. 

Regarding getting buffs.. I found it a major pain to keep hunting traders for maestros every 30 minutes. So I rolled a trader on a second account so I could buff myself  Not the fastest way, but I'm at least self sufficient now.

Email #1:

Reposting a couple emails I sent to feedback:

Alright.. I can understand that this is a very special item, only to be used by the elite of Rubi-Ka..  But the requirements on it are simply unobtainable.

My Opifex Fixer..  With light-green Vehicle Air has titlemaxxed Vehicle Air at 683 at level 167.  The base stats for this skill are also levelmaxxed and in the case of Intelligence, breedcapped.

Unbuffed stats:

Intelligence: 468
Agility: 571
Sense: 544

With Quality Level 200 Shining and Bright implants, I have 851 Vehicle Air.  With a faded, I believe that's an additional 43..  Making the total 894.  Now..  By the time I hit 200, I'll be able to add another 50.  Giving me 934.  I'll have a few points in trickledown from raising Sense and Agility. Let's just say 950 to be cautious.  A QL160 Stiletto takes 920 Vehicle Air to utilize..  A QL200 takes 1150...  1150 is IMPOSSIBLE to achieve.. Even with QL220 implants.

The requirements on these fine vehicles seriously need to be reevaluated.

Email #2:

Just some other facts I felt should be brough to your attention in regards to the Stiletto.

It is painfully obvious that these new vehicles were provided as a status symbol, as they have no gameplay value whatsoever.  They are a moneysink, pure and simple.  Expensive toys for the overrich to get some of the cred out of the destroyed economic system.

One point I feel inclined to make:

If people can't use it...  They won't buy it.

Only Fixers, Adventurers and Traders, with their light-green Vehicle Air skills will even have a CHANCE of using a QL160 Stiletto at level 192...  Level 197 for any breed other than Opifex.

Now, this could be somewhat understandable if only a select few, those who are bred to have higher reflexes and response times, could utilize the premium version of this craft...  Unfortunately, with the way the requirements stand, they're the only ones who case use even the BASE model.  

No other profession will be able to fly a Stilletto.  

Within game mechanics, it is simply an impossibillity, such as equipping a QL200 Stiletto is also an impossibility...

There are no buffs for Vehicle Air, and even if there were...  That rather defeats the purpose of having a Yalmaha if you're having to search for buffs every time to try to equip it.  

Thre is only one item currently in-game that gives a bonus to Vehicle Air, and that item is Trader-Only and gives a minescule amount.


So, again, I implore you to reconsider the requirements on these vehicles.


...and the official response from Cz

Hi there,

Thank you for you feedback on the Stiletto. I'll have a chat with the 
designers about it (again .

Actually, I made a ql 210 of that conductor. Even I can place that easily. Just because it's only listed in the database in certain QLs doesn't mean it's the only QL available. The conductor of Focus is a tradeskill-built only tower, which makes it possible to do in most any QL.

connall @ 12/7/2002 10:43:13 PM (77151):
Well, as a clan agent, everyone gets buffs for free if they ask nicely. I will very rarely charge clanners or neutrals, and Omni employees get nothing, no matter how much they offer. When a tip is offered, about 50k seems usual for FG, or ES, and I don't think that I've ever received a tip for UA or TTS.

The only exception to free buffs is for anything that requires false profession to use. Usually it's only inconsiderate people that ask me to go fp anyway, and most often I'll just apologise and turn down the request. I don't think that most non-agents realise exactly how gimped we are for 30 minutes, if we fp for them... Most agents I know don't want 30 minutes of not casting their highest buffs and a -400 nano init, just because someone can't be bothered to hunt out an enforcer for a mid-level essence. There are times when I'll go fp for people, but usually only if they are desperate and I know I have 30 minutes free. Then they get asked for a tip.

Oh and don't ever try to give Jica a tip if she considers you a friend... My ears still haven't recovered from the bashing that they took the last time I tried to tip her for work...

This seems to be a simple nano stun glove with some experimental, new interface and another type of 'head'. The only clue to its origin is the words imprinted at the wrist, spelling: 'Bang-Bang'.

I really want a black yal and this seems like the most likely target if Im ever gonna be able to fly it. I guess u need the trade skill stuff from the old car shops but Im sure there are more to it.

Great_dane @ 12/8/2002 6:05:01 AM (77151):
The only buff I agree to pay for is Extrem Prejudice, because only few players can cast it, they have to raise 2 dark blue skills (that are used only for this buff) and they generally don't need it for themselves.
I'm a crat, lots of players need a psychology buffs to wear MKII armor, and I never asked for money to buff them, so I see no reason to pay for a buff from someone else.

I don't charge ppl when I give them my ess (regardless if they're rude or not, tho they might end up on the ignore list), therefore I expect the same from buffs others is able to selfcast...

Miniexplicit @ 12/8/2002 5:48:21 PM (78078):
Traders can still get the Stilleto equipped because the skill still maxes as high as the green skill.

Because of that trader armor with the miniscule Vehicle Air increase all breeds of agent can get to the 921+ req to use the Stilleto as well, but you'd be looking at a seriously gimped agent.

The stilleto is like a Limo, use it when you want to arrive in style.  Don't try to use it like your volvo though or you'll run into some serious handicaps.

I have no problem with the stilleto being a limo.  For me the requirement for the limo should be closer to 560 Vehicle Air.  At that req an atrox of any breed who just maxed out Vehicle Air up to lvl 190 would be able to use it with minor buffing.  Maybe the req could even be as high as 600 or 650, so that you'd have to dedicate a shining or Bright/faded clusters to using it at 190.  Or even remove the vehicle Air req all together.  Make it have a level req or a Title level req.  The cost alone makes it so that not everyone is going to have one.  When you see a limo its a safe bet you won't see the person who owns it driving it.  They are in the limo because they paid for it.

Better yet instead of a level requirement or a skill requirement make it have a credit requirement.  Thats right, make the stiletto check your current funds to see if you are *rich* enough to use it.  After all this *is* a status symbol we are talking about.

I don't like the idea of "reasonable" prices.

1 week ago, I wanted payment from every wrangle above 71.

Then I got a new implant setup and can do 109 selfbuffed. That is now the new limit for prices...

Same with IDs. I can make ql 159 Nano Formulas, but I will charge several millions because it will take me 1-2 hours and I have to get some outside bufs. Ask me to do a ql 50 disc and a nice "Thank You" is enough. (ie, Tip if you want). When I can do QL 159 NFs without breaking a sweat, that will become much cheaper.

An apparent Uber Twink that comes and asks for wrangles should pay/tip more than the apparent newbie asking.

Also lowering the rediculous restrictions on the new nanos.  1044 for a QL199 nano so we (engineers) are forever dependant on Mochams and a wrangle just to cast the nano thats good for 20-30 Minutes.

Fixing the switch on the implant disassemblers should be on the low list of easy fixes they need to do.

Items Required:

Cold Stone x 36!!!
Reinforced NotuComm Wire x 6
Nano Programming Interface
Yalmaha Stiletto – Building Kit
Steiner Flexipus Chassis
Ganimedes Flux – M.S. Engine
Klang Orbiter MK
BSEC
Stiletto Registar

BUILDING NOTES:
1. The ColdStones can be found on random mobs and in chests on missions.  All other parts can be bought at the Shops.
2. The final QL of the Stiletto is determined by the QL of the Building Kit.
3. All parts must be within 10% of the part you are combining it with.  For example if you build a QL 160 Stiletto (recommended for many reasons) you can use QL 160 Reinforced NotuComm Wire which in turn allows you to use QL 144+ ColdStones.

After you have all the necessary materials……

Step 1. – Requires Mechanical Engineering Skill 5.5 x QL
Add Steiner Flexipus Chassis to Stiletto Building Kit to get Yalmaha 29500 - Stiletto Building Kit Step 1.

Step 2. – Requires Field Quantum Physics Skill 5 x QL
Add Ganimedes Fulx – M.S. Engine to Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 1 to get Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 2.

Step 3. - Requires Field Quantum Physics Skill 5 x QL
Add Klang Orbiter MK to Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 2 to get Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 3.

Step 4. - Requires Field Quantum Physics Skill 5 x QL
Add BSEC to Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 3 to get Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 4.

Step 5. – Requires Nano Programming Skill 4.5 x QL
Use the Nano Programming Interface on the ColdStone to get Sentinent Cold Stone.  Add Sentinent Cold Stone to Reinforced NotuComm Wire to get NotuComm Circuitry with One Sensor etc...  Add 6 Sentinent Cold Stones to each Wire to get Complete NotuComm Circuitry.

At this point you should have 6 Complete NotuComm Circuitries.  Add one Complete NotuComm Circuitry to another to get Double NotuComm Circuitry.  Do this two more times to get a total of 3 Double NotuComm Circuitries.  Now combine two Double NotuComm Circuitries together to get Quadruple NotuComm Circuitry.  Now add your third Double NotuComm Circuitry to the Quadruple NotuComm Circuitry to get NotuComm Mesh

Step 6. - Requires Field Quantum Physics Skill 5 x QL
Add NotuComm Mesh to Yalmaha 29500 – Stiletto Building Kit Step 4 to get Unmarked Yalmaha 29500 – The Stiletto.  
At this point the Unmarked Yalmaha 29500 – The Stiletto is a tradable item.  So you could have someone make it for you if you do not have the required Trade Skills.  You cannot equip the Stiletto until you do the final step.  The final step however will make it a NO-DROP item.

Step 7. – Final Step
Add Stiletto Registar to Unmarked Yalmaha 29500 – The Stiletto to get your shinny new Yalmaha 29500 – The Stiletto.

Bling! Bling!

Next @ 12/10/2002 10:01:18 AM (Implant QL increase: what is the definitive cause? 79597):
It is well known that when assembling an implant, the QL of the implant can sometimes go up. However, time and time again, I've seen conflicting information on what causes this:

Theory #1: Implant QL increases when installing a cluster that has much higher QL than the implant

	
		
			
			
				Originally posted by Sigyn in this thread:
 A higher cluster can raise implant ql by a couple %.   Example: slapping a ql180 cluster into ql125 basic will likely produce a ql127-128 implant.
			
		
	
Theory #2: Implant QL increases when the character has much higher nanoprogramming skill than needed

	
		
			
			
				Originally posted by BGumble in this thread:
having a cluster of a higher QL than the implant doesnt seem to raise the QL of the assembled implant - what does raise the final QL of the implant seems to be the nano programming skill of the assembler. Get 3 QL30 clusters and a QL30 implant and get them assembled by a level 200 MP you'll end up with an implant maybe around QL35.
			
		
	
So which one is correct? This is something I've always been curious about, and would like to know the definitive answer once and for all.

I think it's number 2, since when I first got my QL125 imps made it only increased 1-2 QL, but when I made my imps with 1k NP they increased to QL130. Not sure if it was the cluster but...

perhaps it's a combination between the two?

implants below QL50 will not raise their QL either...

Cool ... whenever anyone asks me to make something I will give them your name.

Unit99 @ 12/10/2002 3:36:40 PM (79597):
To confuse the issue even more. It also seems to depend on the type of cluster. In example when I add one of the basic ability clusters such as Agility or a Max Health cluster the ql of the implant will raise 1 point. When I add a skill cluster such as Shotgun the ql will go up 2 sometimes 3. I can't understand FC's logic of why to keep information of this nature a secret. Possibly its because their formula is so warped that they can't explain it themselvs.

On a side note it is nice being able to fine tune the ql of an implant by adding a cluster then clearing the implant. Often times I'm unable to find the exact ql implant I need and will buy in upwards of 10 faded clusters to bump the implant to where I want it.

O yea I also 99% positive the NP skill is what causes the increase. Just would be nice to know how much skill bumps ql by what amount.

When I do a tradeskill job for someone (I can do them all aside from tower making) I always charge way lower then I see people advertising on these boards. I'm not a greedy person and just do my part to attempt to get this sick economy back in check. Wish more would think along these lines when I browse through the RK1 market.

Ghir @ 12/10/2002 3:56:05 PM (79597):
In my (albeit somewhat limited) experience, it seems to me that it's actually a combination of both QL imp/cluster as well as the NP of the person putting it together.

For example, I used my doc (350-ish NP) to put together some basic implants of QL 50-75.  I noticed a slight QL increase if the cluster was well above the QL of the basic implant but nothing fancy.

When I went to have my QL 125 imp set created, the QL increase was *much* more noticable since the person creating the finished imps has a much higher (around 900) NP skill, although the difference in QL between the basic imp and the clusters going into them was realitivly similar.

I don't use my doc for much of anything anymore, so if someone would like to try to come up with some sort of a algorithim as to how QL/NP affects finished result and use her as the low-level baseline, /tell ghir in game and we'll hook up to do that as I'm pretty curious myself.

Ghir @ 12/10/2002 4:04:10 PM (Hacking the Mausser 79671):
I've started hacking my own MPSs into MCSs and am enjoying the freedom of creating my own weapons without having to bother anyone else about helping out, but have some questions.

Does anyone know what the skill requirements, in terms of B&E, WS, and ME that are required based on the QL of the item?  Also, does anyone know what affect the Carbonum Plating has on the finished QL?

My experience, so far, has been that it seems to require around 3x the QL in skills to do each part, but I know my numbers are skewed, as I had the following happen:

QL 96 MPS + QL 199 Hacking tool = QL 96 MPS Base
QL 96 MPS Base + QL 97 Chem Chamber = QL 96 MCS Base
QL 96 MCS Base + QL 106 Short Com Barrel = QL 96 (Step 2 - I forget the name)
QL 96 Step 2 + QL 100 Carbonum Plating = QL 98 MCS (???)

Just wondering why the 2 QL increase right at the end even though the QLs were *very* similar.  I try do keep it close when i can do the enormous cost of the plating (was nearly 300k for the last part - ouch!).

Anyway, any input would be appreciated.

There must be a way to build/find/buy a control tower of these ql...  What is it?

Nooki @ 12/10/2002 6:08:38 PM (79597):
It seems to me to be the nanoprogramming skill.

I can take a QL196 empty implant and after adding 3 clusters it will be a QL200 full implant.  Because the cluster QLs are almost always below the original 196, this would seem to me to disprove Sigyn's "high cluster theory" (theory #1).  I can do this for any type of implant with all type of clusters which would seem to disprove Unit99s "type of cluster theory".  All this leads me to believe that it is nanprogramming skill.

In my experience, the final product is *often* raised 2 levels for 1 cluster added, 3 levels for 2 clusters added and 4 levels for 3 clusters added.  This is not a hard rule but a general observation - it varies much.

Actually the towers only range from 10 - 250.  Just keep checking the shops and you will find one that you are looking for.

Hodelay @ 12/10/2002 6:34:28 PM (79671):
I believe the QL jump is determined by how high your trade skill score is compared to what is needed to combine the part.  When I combine low QL Mauseers they usually jump 2 QL per step.

The final step required Mech. Engineering Skill so that why you got the QL jump.

Hodelay @ 12/10/2002 6:38:41 PM (79440):
You cannot make control towers at this time.  You can buy them in Shops.   There is ONE tower that is not of the standard QLs.  Unfortunately since there is always someone in the TowerShop the shop does not refresh very offen so it is quite difficult to get an exact QL you want.

Placing the tower does not change the QL.

Thelcia @ 12/10/2002 9:13:17 PM (79597):
I do beleive it is the NP skill that determines increase. However, on the type of cluster dependency...

I do notice some faded increase plants by 2ql and some by 3ql. I beleive this is due to the difference in required skill vs. actual skill. 

Thus, if a person has 1k NP, a cluster that only requires 100NP to install will increase the QL more than a cluster that requires 900NP. 

It is definately true that for ql190ish plants and 1k NP, faded tends to increase the QL by about 3, bright by about 1-2, and shining 0-1. I think the reason for this is that the NP requirement is so much lower on the faded vs. shining etc.

Detonate @ 12/10/2002 9:21:45 PM (79597):
When doing implants, let's say a 125 Implants.  I first go buy a low level faded cluster from the basic shop.

I then try and combine that with the implant, know that I don't have the skill and that the cluster is too low.

It gives me feedback on the lowest level cluster I can put in there, as well as the skill needed.

I then proceeded to go buy all clusters between the Lowest End, and QL125.

Whenever I had them assembled by a guildie with 1100 Nano Programming, I found that the Implants were raising dramatically in QL, and thus screwing up all the clusters I bought on the low end....  :P

Dalmatia @ 12/11/2002 9:39:04 AM (79597):
It is the NP... as to why the increase varies, it's because it is a function of the NP skill verses the required NP skill and faded, bright and shining clusters of the same ql have different reqs... hence the big increase with fadeds, small increase with shinings. 
Also, different clusters have different NP reqs, for example life clusters req 5-10% more than other clusters. Hope this helps.

It is a tradeskill when you are selling your skills. The customer that ask you to strip implants isn't buying the tools you need to strip it, but your skills - so in definition is B&E a tradeskill when you tune tankarmor and strip implants. 

But the placement of the different skills is not good, the only real tradeskills is computer literacy and psychology - nothing else.

Chela @ 12/11/2002 12:59:26 PM (Jobe implants? 80027):
I was wandering what are the rules on constructing jobe implants?

If I have bright cluster of nano regeneration it can be put in already made implant(shining and faded) or must be put in empty implant and other clusters are added later?

And what skills would be needed for ql 200?

So u gonna say that NanoSkills are TradeSkills too, coz everyone buy mochams, wrangs and +80?

Having done some homework I assume this drops from the Rat Catcher MOB that also drops the goggles?

Any eta on 14.8 btw (I'm assuming it isnt todays patch as the version on test live isnt 14.8)

You'll hear no complaint from me about this...  I have two pet classes and I know the pain well.

Precisely my point...  Funcom focuses on the easy-to-fix problems...  Therefore, this has a much higher chance of being fixed.

I know VERY little about programming, however...  I do know that repairing pet-pathing would be exceptionally simple.. Even if they implemented it temporarily.

You simply need to install a diamond grid overlay within missions.  Pets can only navigate via this grid..  Admittedly, their movement would look rather odd if you sent them straight out in the wrong direction, but it would work...  Allow me to use a very poor visual diagram:

----DOOR------
        /\
       /  \
      /    \
     /      \
    /        \

\    TABLE   /
 \              /
  \            /
   \          /
    \        /
     \      /
      \    /

    \        /
     \      /
      \    /
       \  /
        \/
----------------

The diamonds represent the path the pet must take to navigate the room.   As you can see, the apex of the diamond converges at all entries and exits.  For the more unusual rooms (I.e.: the rooms full of benches) you can still use the basic diamond-mapping, you just tilt it a bit, converting it to either a trapezoid or square.  It's a simple four-point system.  

Just my 2 cred.

(Grrr... ..and yes, my limited knowledge of PHP forums shows through as I don't know how to format properly...  )

but what about Guardian Conductor of Focus?

PS where did u find 'Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots?

/tell wavelord for ingame tells

JimSalabim @ 12/11/2002 2:46:50 PM (79597):
The information is not secret. The QL of the result can depend on two things: The item (process) you are doing and your skill.

"Normally" the QL of the result depends only on the QL of the second combine item (the item that is NOT picked up when you combine the two items).

In some of those processes there is a % that increases the QL of the result IF you have higher skill than what is needed to make it.

Those percentages varies with the process. E.g. Improving melee weapons give a large increase, while making dragon armor give no increase at all.

Example: In the process "Sandwich with Fish Eyes", the modifier is set to 140%, and combining requires 100 skill in Adventuring.

The "Sandwich" is QL 10 and the "Fish Eyes" is QL 1. You pick up the "Fish Eyes" and combine it with the "Sandwich".

With skill 100 in Adventuring you will end up with a QL 10 result.

Now, if your skill is 200 - double of what is required, you get the full increase, and end up with a QL 14 result.

If your skill is 150 you will end up with a QL 12 result Etc.

Hope that helps somewhat.

Nooki @ 12/11/2002 2:57:01 PM (79597):
Yes it does help.

But now I have to add another line to my sig.  Hope Funcom can afford another raise.

a simple question to Knightwulf and Justafixer:
"Is assembling implants a tradeskill work?"

If the answer to this question is yes, then is the reversed work also consider to be tradeskills. The reversed work of assembling implants is stripping implants. 

Also remember you need NP to strip implants.

WaveLord @ 12/11/2002 3:44:29 PM (79084):
omg...
YOU DONT NEED NP TO STRIP IMPLANTS!!!
just CL and B&E

Actually disassembling implants = hacking implants so it is hacker's work, not tradeskills.

So..  Under this line of thinking..  The hacker who drops a DDoS attack on the backbone has to have the same skills and knowledge as the Engineer who designed the motherboard/CPU/graphics card within the system he's using?  I think not.

that isn't a reversed work, and stripping doesn't have same skills as assembling.

What I'm saying is that a reversed work should also be consider as a tradeskill - that's it.

Justafixer: I'm pretty sure you need 4.75xQL in B&E, 4xQL in CP and 1xQL in NP.

WaveLord @ 12/11/2002 4:34:23 PM (79084):
hm... I cant be sure coz I got over 300 NP before patch with disassembly clinic. 

But I'll check  it when server goes up.

dropcid @ 12/11/2002 4:41:16 PM (79084):
You definitley need NP to strip implants... just not much, only 1*QL
So to strip a QL200 imp, you only need 200NP. I know this because I have to grab a NP buff to do some of my work. Maybe you already have 200 so you just haven't noticed?

Nor is stripping implants a reversed work..  If it were... The clusters would be salvaged...  This is simply causing the clusters to deactivate without crashing the implant.

This discussing is pointless, another example. Do you agree that decoding is the reversed work of encoding? Do you really think you will get the same source if you decode an application? No, you won't, but you will get a source that is very equal to the original. 

Same thing with the implants, you start with your base (the implant itself) and add some modifiers (the clusters). If you are going to reverse this you have to remove the clusters to get your implant back. The one you started the hole process with.

So in my eyes will this be considered as tradeskill work since it's doing the opposite of normal assembling. But if you don't agree it's fine, not going to repeat myself forever...

Hodelay @ 12/11/2002 7:38:51 PM (80027):
You can combine Jobe Clusters into an implant that already has other clusters.  Just make sure that it is not a "Jobe - Refined" Cluster as those can only be placed into Refined Implants and vise versa.

Im not sure about the skill required for the Bright Nano-Regeneration Cluster but the Shinning one takes 1050 Pharm-Tech.

Whoops.  Who woulda thunk it!

Khaln @ 12/12/2002 2:06:55 AM (79084):
Seems "trade skill" needs a definition here.

"Trade skill" does not appear in the dictionary (or at least, not the one I'm using here, www.dictionary.com ), so I'll break it down. "Trade skill" means having skill in trade. "Trade" is a word with a fairly long list of definitions and usage, but in this context it clearly means:


	
		
			
			
				Trade n.
6. An occupation, especially one requiring skilled labor; craft: the building trades, including carpentry, masonry, plumbing, and electrical installation.
			
		
	
So "trade skill" is skill in an occupation requiring skilled labor. A trade skill process would be a process requiring skilled labor.

Implant disassembly requires skilled labor (B&E, CL, and NP from what I read in this thread).

Therefore, implant disassembly is a trade skill process.

Eidolus @ 12/12/2002 5:23:33 AM (79084):
Implant disassembly isn't even DISASSEMBLY, if you want to be techincal about the wording, since the clusters are lost.

You are yanking out some of the electronics, for lack of a better term, so that new electronics can be installed. It's a jerry-rig process.

Taking a blowtorch to a piston rod to get the piston out of a car engine is hardly disassembling the engine. Implant "disassembly" is more akin to controlled breaking.

By the previous definition, hacking a Mausser or a Titan Message Container open is a tradeskill process, since it involves the use of skilled labor.

There's a significant difference between a locksmith and a burglar.

And there is absolutely nothing wrong with implant hacking being limited to fixers only. If you disagree, then I want every item in the game that does not read "Fixer" in the requirements section to be useable by Fixers, because that is exactly what is going on with implant disassembly clinics. For instance, Where is my balaclava? It has an Agent profession requirement, much like the disassembly clinic has a Fixer profession requirement, yet my Fixer can't wear one.

I fail to see why other professions should get a benefit from, or be able to use, an item intended by its requirements for Fixers when Fixers do not get benefits from, or the ability to use, items intended for other professions (e.g. balaclavas).

Mercatura @ 12/12/2002 7:52:41 AM (79084):
Right or wrong, "fixing" implant dissasembly to be a fixer only process would only hurt the playerbase as it is now.

A fair amount of that is due to shining B&E blocking SMG among other things.

so what you are saying is that tradeskills should be professionspecific, lets say only Engineers can make armor then, since they are best at it, and only fixers can strip implants. This would be fun...

I'm an Engineer, and if armorcreation would become engineer only I would also quit this game... But, I like the idea that make it easier for specific professions to do certain things.

Funcom will never make tradeskills professions only...

I don't see how it would hurt the playerbase at all..  After fourteen four, the world is overrun with PVPing, ninjaing, ph1xx0r twinks...  You need that B&E to crack open every chest whilst the rest of the team is off fighting...  Tracking down a Fixer/ph1xx0r is not a difficult task.

Not a big deal..  By the time we can afford to spend the insane amounts of IP required to raise our skill high enough to strip QL200's we can already self-equip QL200 implants.

My whole point to this is it was supposed to be Fixer-only...  ..and it still is..  At least according to various Advisors, GM's and community reps I've spoken to...  It simply has not been fixed.

Why?  Because Traders would actually have to ask someone else for a favor instead of everyone asking Traders for services?    

Somehow I doubt making implant disassembly clinics Fixer-only would cause the playerbase much, if any, grief.  We'll adjust.  There's certainly many more Fixers than there are Traders, so finding a Fixer to do an implant disassembly would be easier than, say... finding a Trader to wrangle me into a new weapon.  Those who have implant disassembly clinics (the ones who would be most affected by this change) and are not Fixers don't even have to find a Fixer with both the skill and equipment for the job, just the proper skill (since he can loan the Fixer his own clinic).  Fixers will also adjust to the new conflicting cluster problem.  Tradeskillers implant switch all the time to satisfy the needs of a customer, why wouldn't Fixers?  I know I switch implants occasionally to get into a new weapon (my implants are geared towards my Grid Armor right now), so in battle I actually only have one SMG cluster.

As for the priority of things... Funcom states they have multiple teams working on multiple problems concurrently, which is why some seemingly insignificant bugs seem to be fixed sooner than some incredibly important bugs.  I wouldn't assume that fixing something like this would divert resources to more important problems, so I don't think taking prioritizing unto ourselves has any relevence in these discussions.

Stripping IMPLANTS requires B&E and NP.  Nothing else.

Hacking nearly anything ELSE requires B&E and Comp Lit... such as hacking the Portable Treatment clinic so you can get the Implant Disassembly Clinic made.

The fact is mega that trade skill tower is impossible to make... A trader pre-200 can only get up to MAX 1175 EE/MM WITH a guild advantage chip giving +27ish more. That said we could only possibley make a ql 203 tower, so at 200 maybe ql 205 we can pull out? =p Engies Can also make alightly better towers given meastros from a trader can get up to around 1200. =] ! I think those tards at FC need to lower the req on this shiz, it is truly bs.

What this Service Towers used for?

Eidolus @ 12/12/2002 5:58:17 PM (79084):
Krabbus, if the ITEM that enables someone to strip implants has a profession requirement of Fixer to wear, why should it not be a Fixer-specific process?

Can I get a terrorist hoody to boost my aimed shot? No. Why? Because only Agents can use their item that requires the Agent profession.

Why should you be able to use the implant disassembly clinic when it has Fixer as a requirement?

I think we need to se if we can find the patch notes from when this was introduced, because I recall it saying that Fixers were going to be the ones stripping implants. As far as I can recall, it didn't read "A new item that will have a profession requirement of Fixer will enable anyone and everyone to remove clusters from implants. Screw you, Fixers!"

Also, as far as tradeskills go, Fixers don't really have the most ideal set for stripping implants, so your "best at it" argument is hogwash. Show me a class with green B&E and NP, and they'll be the "best" at it.

Once again, there is a significant difference between a locksmith, who can use tools to open a lock you have lost the key for in a legal fashion, and a burglar, who uses tools to get into places where he isn't supposed to be for illegal purposes.

The bottom line of your contention seems to be that you want to have it all. No class should be able to use their skills in a way that you cannot.

You want an NCU Hacker Interface, too?

Fixers should be the only ones stripping implants because that was what it seems we were TOLD was going to be the case.

Like many other things (clan org skill advantages, for example), it hasn't happened.

mmm, ok, all weaponcreation is engineer specific them, since it's an engineers work

Eidolus @ 12/12/2002 6:53:34 PM (79084):
Can you show me any one piece of any weapon that has a requirement of Engineer to wear, wield or use, that goes into making any kit weapon in the game?

No, you can't, because no such item exists.

The implant disassembly clinic CLEARLY says Fixer in its requirements. Does it say engineer? No. Trader? No. Any other profession? No.

Enough with the pseudo-logic. The item used to strip implants has a Fixer requirement. No item used to build a weapon or armor has an engineer requirement. Show me one that does. Go ahead. I defy you to.

The issue is not about skill, it is about the item, and only the item. Without the clinic, stripping implants is not possible, no matter what skills you have trained, and no matter how you try to dress up the argument with nonsense about work.

Hi Valroshe,
  I don't think this Turret can be made right now.   Of the weapons that the Defense Patrollers, Guards & Scouts drop there is no quest available for the Booster Edition.  My guess is that the quest for turning these will result in the gun needed to make the Depredating Turret.

Hmm, perhaps fixers should make this for their own?

Not a single tradeskill process in this game is profession specific, that's only for wear, you only need the skills. 
What makes this game unqiue is the skills, and if everything is going towards selfonly, professiononly will this game be very boring...

Hodelay @ 12/12/2002 7:25:31 PM (80568):
Pretty much 50/50 between Trader and Engie in my opinion.  

With just self buffs a Trader is much better but with Maestros an Engie can make higher QL stuff because of all the TradeSkill Equipment they have (new engie hat is very nice ).  The big setback for Engie is the DarkBlue Psychology which is now used to make some Implants.

Val @ 12/12/2002 7:50:05 PM (77916):
actually i was thinking, if you notice, the weopons when used in your formula all make "turrets" all with a different type of damage as a symbol on the turret icon, well if you look at all the different "Pulse Turrets"(different type of turret) there is one pulsating turret for each of the damage type symbols also.  
So I was thinking that there may be something else that you add to the turret or perhaps something done to the weopon to make it into the "Pulsating" type of turret, just my 2 cents pls let me know if you find out anything

gwend @ 12/12/2002 8:25:15 PM (76234):
people keep telling me slag made ql200 cas out of ql160 notum i havnt had the balls or cash to experiment but so far

ql180 nano bots is lowest you can combine with ql200 armor

al161 notum will not combine with the nano bots so ql162 is minium lvl there

maybe if you got 1k skill the ql moves up but it hasnt for me yet so i dunno how slaggie made ql200 out of ql160

perhaps something like this added to the mix:

just an idea if anyone knows if that is used on something else pls

Hodelay @ 12/12/2002 8:56:13 PM (76234):
The lowest QL Notum I have ever used to make ql 200 CAS armor is a ql 161 piece.   In order to used the QL 161 you must have QL 179 Liquid Nanobots and use QL 199 Organic/Graph Armor.  The final set will bump the Armor to QL 200.   If you can make the Armor jump 2 QL with final step then you can use QL 160 Notum.  But so far all the CAS that I have make has only jumped by 1 QL so I haven't bothered trying to used it on QL 198 Organic/Graph.  Ending up with QL 199 CAS would suck

Um, I don't think that towers should be something that one does not get maestros for when they make them...considering all of the other gear and buffs you have to get anyway.

One of my favorite pastimes is mathing out maxes of things and from what I have seen, traders may be the best at "self-buffed" tower construction, but only engies have the capability of making the highest towers. From what I have seen so far, it seems that without using anything that is not in game, although some things might be hard to obtain, traders probably max out at about 213 conductors. Engies, with the addition of their gear, should be able to get up to 225-maybe 227 with the new hat. 

Has this been done yet? Nope, doesn't look like it. Would it be difficult? Absolutely. In terms of how long a tower will remain standing, is 227 much different than 213? Well, yes.

I figured it out when Pogobear asked me...

Solitus 200 Trader

480 Int

30 two eggs
22 faded ear int
12 int boost

gives a base CL of 675 

210 triple CL imp
210 token board
260 trader buff
50 tutor ql200
20 general
10 barter body armor
10 head skinchip temperature

26 Krutt ql184 WQS (20 + 6 from 24 int)

1471

OR

40 from a pair of ql44 T70 Pistols

1485

You could get a few more points from sekutek and swapping intern op coat but Pogo said the req on his 220 was 1485 and need pioneer for tutor. Easier that way than getting a 960 req tutor device 

Come see me at level 200  I just need the pistols and parts for the body armor, along with a couple implants.

I suspect very few (possibly none) of the existing 200 traders maxed tutor or are willing to reset things.

porter @ 12/13/2002 12:10:06 PM (79084):
Maybe I should not touch a flammable subject like this especially from at work where I don't have the time to check some facts, but... Isn't the Disassembly Clinic supposed to have a wear requirement of Fixer? If that worked correctly only fixers could wear the item but other people could use the item to crack implants if they had the skills. Wearing the clinic is quite useful because of the boost in treatment (+20 at ql 200). In fact I seem to recall that recently I've had to remove the clinic from my wear window to inventory before I've been able to strip implants.

About the meaning of words... Well, I agree with some of the above posters that implant disassembly is a hacking process and not a trade skill as in building an item is. Regardless of that I can live with others maybe being able to clean implants as well. I'm more likely able to do it earlier being a fixer with nice B&E buffs.

Spring crystals can be added to a ring (that is a ring made by a player, not the ones looted), however I remember reading a post somewhere ages ago that said spring crystals always reduced the final selling price of the item (regardless of QL) and so it was better to just use a gem cutter on them and sell them

The first superior shop I checked has ql 198 MMR's for about 4 million credits.

Stripping Implants should be Fixer only.
We are the B&E masters, and as such, we should be the only class able to do this process. Hacking is our skill, not building towers, guns, or armor.  Breaking and Entry is not on the Tradeskill tab... its a process of stripping down something...
like say... Hmmm, car jacking... we use our smg to 'persuade' someone to get out of their car, we then drive their car to the garage.... we then get paid by an engineer or trader for bringing them the car....

or better yet.
'Hi bob!'
'Hey Jim!'
'Got new implants I see?'

I'd say that you need to take everything that Louiexkaboom says with a grain of salt, but that would be like saying that Newland Desert at high-noon whilst wearing a LLTS is mildly illuminated.

Eidolus @ 12/14/2002 3:52:57 PM (79084):
Without the help of an agent or fixer character it is impossible for other professions to have access to the item that makes it possible to strip implants.

A fixer can, with the expenditure of IP and/or implanting, make a clinic for him or herself.

Can you get the item on your own, Krabbus? Perhaps you should try it, without any outside help from another character, whether it's someone else's or your own.

Again, without the item, the process is not possible, tradeskill or otherwise.

Tradeskill processes in AO use items that have no profession requirements and are available either through regular vendors or by obtaining specific items through means available to all characters (e.g. killing mobs).

The same cannot be said for the implant disassembly tool.

To strip implants, having the skill gets you nowhere without the item. The item makes it possible.

I can't accrue any personal benefit from any item that has a different profession as a requirement. None. Neither should any one else be able to.

Tradeskills: Engineer Vs. Traders

in all actuality usually engineers can get higher tradeskills then traders their level because of all of the special adds that funcom gives us to try and make up for our lack of tradeskill buffs. now all of our little things like Construction Sleeves, Technical Ceremonies Armor, Engineer T.I.M. Scope, and the New Engineer Hat give us decent tradeskills at best... but add trader tradeskill buffs to those, and we end up with a higher skill level. however, most engineers would rather just have buffs and not have to worry about tracking down all of those little pieces of armor or clothing that add tiny ammounts to tradeskills. also, some of the tradeskill adding armor is extremely hard to come by, the best being nodrop (Tech Ceremonies Armor).

Doing the highest possible quality work means getting outside buffs one way or another, though which buffs (and how many) varies widely.

Oh and non-combat might as well be "non leveling". If you mean as little combat as possible, engineer can rely completely on the pet for awhile, but not forever without forgoing teaming. A non-combat trader will get lots of comments in teams from day one.

engies make the best overall trade skillers...there are many unique items that are engie only that add to trade skills, of course youll need a trader to cast maestros, but the result is the best trade skiller....  Also, mps are the best NPers.  The new NT middle level buff doesnt stack with ASM, and it gives 17 less np...the high level one needs mochams and a wrangle to cast...so its not really useful...   The breed really only gives a couple points in the end..and youll need to pick your breed for the skills you want...nanomage is probably your best bet though, as all trade skills are at least 50% int dependant, and in addition you can wear shades of lucubration...which will give you another couple points...and jones vest if you are NPing

I've recently started an MP, but can find no information on how to build implants. My last few forays into the Subway has given me TONS of nanoclusters and empty implants all of around QL5-6.

My char is only level 6, so this is perfect for me.

I've tried every method in getting them together that I know of, but don't see any specific posts or information how to combine them.

Here's what I've tried.. 2 whole things.

Combine NC with Imp.

This should answer most of your questions.
Btw Its very easy to put on implants with ql much higher than your level so you should try to put on as high a ql implants as you can manage (but this can be expensive for new characters). Remeber that the surgery clinic adds 100 to your treatment. Docs can give treatment buffs and if you buy a full set of omni med suit it adds about 78 to your treatment skill.

Phoxtrot0 @ 12/17/2002 5:23:52 PM (The Cost of Trade tools 82342):
Some tools like the neutron displacer are so costly that no newbie can dream to use them. 

What is the point of making a whole part of the game only accessible to very high level players when only a very small change could allow lower level players to use the trade skill and still can keep everything in balance ?

As it stand now, it seems that the cost of  each tool is very close to something like (with 'k' different for each tool): 
k *QL^2

(I'll post the precise formula once I have it figured out) 


In order to make those tools more accessible to newbies, the price for these tools should be based on QL^3 with the constant changed so that the price for the tools needed for building a QL133 crystal is unchanged.
(That is : lev34 PPE, lev67 Isotope, Lev67 Neutron-D)


This would imply that the cost for tools limited to building :

QL200 crystals would be :  +50%
QL133 crystals would be :  +00%
QL66   crystals would be :  -50%
QL33   crystals would be :  -75%

compared to the prices as they are today.

(e.g : tools for level 33 would now cost 1/64 of the tools needed for lev 133 whereas they previously costed 1/16 of their 133 counterparts)

Of course, this scheme can be adjusted in many ways  (the exponent can be set to something between 2 and 3 or some the inflexion point moved away from QL133 and/or a linear factor added so that very low level items are not TOO cheap.)


This new price scheme would have the advantage of encouraging engineers to buy intermediate levels tools before they one day get the money to buy the top notch ones. It would also create a market for second hand tools.

I know that this bunch of maths is perhaps already making some of you puke but please note that this price scheme would not be inherently any more complex than the present one, it is just the comparison that is a bit tricky.



An alternative idea would be to create "item banks" for orgs where members could rent tools or make gifts.

Comments ?

Drusillus @ 12/17/2002 6:32:14 PM (82342):
You should have seen how much they USED to cost   I remember buying a set of level 40 nanocrystal tools and I think it set me back over 900k.

The req for the etching part is 4.5 * QL for both ME and Chem. Don't know about the last step tho.

Ensignm @ 12/18/2002 12:36:53 AM (82342):
You won't need ql 200 tools unless you need to make a quality 400 nanocrystal. The QL of the Jensen P.O.E must be 25% or higher than that of the Carbonrich Rock. The quality of the Isotope Separator must be 50% or higher than that of the Carbonrich Ore.  And the quality of the neutron displacer needs to be atleast 50% or higher then that of the pure carbon crystal.  So if you have quality 110ish tools you'll be fine atleast untill Shadow Lands comes out. If you can't afford to buy those tools you are too low level to earn any money making nanos anyway. Most people say it isn't even worth the IP and money untill level 150+. I think you shouldn't start before you're level 50-60.

All the info about the quality of the tools can be found at The workshop

Enough with the pseudo-logic. The item used to strip implants has a Fixer requirement. No item used to build a weapon or armor has an engineer requirement. Show me one that does. Go ahead. I defy you to.

The issue is not about skill, it is about the item, and only the item. Without the clinic, stripping implants is not possible, no matter what skills you have trained, and no matter how you try to dress up the argument with nonsense about work.

The balance is better now.

There s just the problem of geting (with % chance too high) rare items like GA or PPPE armor not depending on special mobs (high level or tough combat or quest etc...) but just random loot like those ql 57 team missions (i did like 120 missions and still havent got a PPE)

Agent  = Non-green tradeskills
And most of the engy tradeskill buffing items is real proffesion dependant, not visual-proffesion.

MartekO @ 12/18/2002 7:28:55 PM (82580):
I stayed 8 weeks at L86/87 (both are able to roll down to L60) to try to get a PPPE.

I did find a PPPE-Hard after about 50 missions (yay!).  Traded it for a VTE (via auction here on the Rimor exchange).

Of course that hyped me up.  I want two eggs, so I kept doing those solo boss missions to get a 2nd PPPE to trade for my second egg.

So, I did another 300 or so L60 solo team missions after finding the first one and didn't find a second.  Finally I got tired of not leveling and it was turning into a grind.  So I finally gave up and started leveling again.

Currently I'm wearing my one egg and saving up for my second.

Good luck to you!

Rugger807 @ 12/19/2002 12:17:24 AM (81997):
Were talkin Pure tradeskill?

Nano Trader:  Hands down.  You can have a decent trader with lower than average nano skills and use deprives to make up for it until you hit a title cap.  It all really depends on the level.

Best Nano programmer:

Nano Meta:  Largest NP boost, intel boost.

Why it was suggested that engineer was the best is beyond me.  The largest NP boosting item an eng gets is a modified A-4000 sheet for +40.  Why solitus was suggested is well out of my visual range.

Best target for target practice?

nanomage engineer

Shantan @ 12/19/2002 11:07:23 AM (82580):
Although I have heard tales of these dropping on a mob OTHER than the boss, or found in chest, I have never met anybody that can confirm this.

Both of the PPPE hards I found were on the boss. Same boss type (Nano - full face covering [nut-cup face?]). Same mission zone and area (Lush Resort, first mission door on right across pool when zoning in from grid). Different characters.

Why do I post the location/monster type?

a) not in this range anymore

b) selling two of these in 3 days made enough cash to live on anyway

c) if enough people find one, maybe my org engi can get one for cheaper than I sold mine for (joined org AFTER selling the second one - wishing I had kept the spare)

Good luck to you. These need to be MUCH less rare than they are.

i read many posts with regards to making CAS armor and they are all confusing at best and contradictory many times. so here is a simple question.

could someone please tell me what are ALL the components that I need to collect in order to make a ql 200 CAS helm or legs or bodyarmor and their respective minimum ql for each piece ?


Thank you.

Drusillus @ 12/19/2002 3:24:31 PM (82342):
Like Ensign was saying, you could make QL40 nanocrystals with QL20 tools, which should set you back maybe 5000 credits for all three tools.  If that's still to expensive for you, hell, give Drusillus a /tell on RK1 and I'll give you the money

Maimgara @ 12/19/2002 5:35:34 PM (81997):
We're including out-side buffs, so caps matters more.

Engy QF/ME/EE cap (slightly) higher then trader's, so we're theoreticaly the best traderskillers within those skills.

I'm not going to fool around with highest NP/PT.

Gimpy @ 12/19/2002 7:26:18 PM (82844):
Making a guess this is for CAS armor since the 900 in chem is what you need for QL200 stuff.

Slag can make it on RK1.

Jerrak @ 12/19/2002 7:35:18 PM (81997):
I think just a plain old Solitus Engineer

Being Soli, you have no weak abilities, so you wont have as high tradeskills as other breeds, such as nanomage, but until you can really jump into tradeskills, the boost of HP from the light blue stamina will help out.

Nanomage would be better in the end, but you gotta get there first, and i think solitus beats nano to the finish line.

Gimpy @ 12/19/2002 7:43:18 PM (82320):
At level 6 he can get into QL10's easy enough but I would wait until lvl 7 and get a decent belt on (3 slot) and throw in some NCU's and go get a essence (small) and presto QL15' implants are doable at that time.

Treatment isnt something I would worry about until lvl 25ish.  Just shout a request for a medsuit if your not omni by doing a few shouts in newland city by the missions.  Someone will sell you a suit for 50K.

Elbo @ 12/19/2002 8:04:42 PM (58972):
Just to refresh everyone.

EE 1178
ME 1150
etc etc.
1050 in Pharm Tech
1040 in NP..  (don't ask why its 1040..)
Chem 900.

Nano crystals up to QL215 If you really want the QL239 blitz it.  A whole lot less painful even if you end up at the reclaim than for someone to build it.

Towers See EE and ME.

Jobe Implants (defensive) see pharm tech.

Weapon Smithing:  QL200=easy.

CAS QL200

Virral Eggs: 4M swapped no wait.

Most of this stuff is tips.  

Tip Suggestions: QL175+ 1M  

If you want to argue about a price like the Virral Eggs then add 1M.  If you want to argue further you won't be getting a response as you made my ignore list.



If you don't see something here that can be built thats ok I can build it anyways.  Only exception is the Offensive Jobe implants requiring Psychology.

Jica @ 12/19/2002 8:30:43 PM (78187):

Elucidate @ 12/20/2002 12:37:50 AM (82320):
That's all fine and dandy, but I'll be lucky to find implants I can afford before level 40+.

I don't have a high level alt to drop money to my new characters. Wish I did.. Still can't find a class that interests me long enough to get enough levels to twink the hell out of my current characters.

Granted, that requires I know how to twink, which I don't.

Slyyk @ 12/20/2002 12:45:56 AM (Tradeskills and Parts 83117):
Also posted in Future Anarchy-Suggestions


Tradeskills are hard enough to figure out as is, so why is acquiring the parts you need made even harder? While it's great that adding a tradeskill section to shops was introduced, why is it so hard to find parts when I need to make a certain QL item. I'll give two examples:

1) Shopping for nanoclusters for implants. While trying to purchase clusters for QL 200 implants there is a cutoff for what clusters will conceviably go into each QL implant. The cutoff for QL 200 is a QL 175 or higher cluster. Several times I went to different superior shops (4 to be precise) and would find clusters at QL 174, one QL too low for my imps. My suggestion is to put clusters in the shops that are at 174 and 175 for each cluster. Also do the same thing for every QL of store bought implant, one over and under the cutoff range for those empty implants.

2) Tower construction. I'm trying to build towers for land control areas. I have polychromic nanobots and want to make a QL 40 tower for an area that supports max QL 40 towers. Been to the tower shop in Rome and Borealis and found a QL 46 and 43 Guardian Conductor Building Kits. These kits will make QL 46 and 43 towers, not the QL 40 that I need. With the recycle rate of the tower shops it could take weeks to find a QL 40.

My suggestion for a fix: This is supposed to be the 24th or whatever century. If Fixers can summon an exact QL item from thin air everytime (don't start about how random the item is), why is it so hard to find what you need in a shop? While as I said it's great that tradeskill sections have been added I think shops need to be a bit more versatile. Money sinks have been added to the game (10M for Yalmaha spray paint cans, 500k for sunglasses that give +1 intelligence [that seems ironic, eh?]) I think a much better money sink would be if you could pick the QL of item you need from a shop, or at least have some way of picking the QL of the finished item depending on your skills. If someone has gone thru the trouble of raising their tradeskills to 500-1000 to make items it seems pretty silly to me that whenever they put something together they have no idea what the final QL of said item will be until after they do it.

Hollowbyte @ 12/20/2002 1:23:27 AM (76234):
cool, i have 1 ql 175, 1 to go.

that explained  a lot, thanks

BTW where or how do i obtain the ql 180+ nanobot liquid ? can it be bought in stores similar to carbonum sheets ?

Thelcia @ 12/20/2002 2:07:09 AM (83117):
Just to let you know, the ql of conductors is not determined by the building kit, but rather by the ql of the program that is used. I believe that the only tradeskill tower that can be made at ql40 is the corruption one and so you would need to find a ql40 conductor of corruption program. 

On the clusters and implants, although they say that you can use implants about 15% higher, this is not really true. There are different requirements for shining, bright, and faded. I think the lowest cluster you can use for 200 implants in shining is about 180, bright about 170-172ish, and faded about 163. 

However...finding just the right ql part is definately a pain. I am not sure if I would want to replace this all together with say a "what ql would you like?" box, but items available in standard ql's would be nice.

Slyyk @ 12/20/2002 3:26:43 AM (83117):
Just made a guardian of corruption tower. Used a QL 40 program with a QL 43 kit. I now have a QL 43 Guardian Conductor of Corruption I can't use.

On another note, my Engie also just got asked to make someone a low QL set of Carbonum armor. I said "I'm sorry, but I can't help you". " Reply, "But it's only a QL 25 set, plz help". Me, "I may be a level 131 Engineer with over 500 points in each of my trade skills, but unless you have the incredibly rare drop QL 60 PPPE Shape Hard armor I can't even make QL 1 Carbonum. The only people I know that make carbonum is XXXXX or XXXXX and he/she charges 1.5/2k per QL for each piece after you buy the carbonum." Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture?

I just realized I gave two examples why tradeskills are borked. *sigh* Maybe in 30 more levels or so I can make a butter knife or something........

Hello Everyone,

I have me a fixer and was lucky enough to find this disk.  I have a lvl 65 Trader as well and was wondering if it might be possible to turn this into a crystal with her.  Can someone tell me if this might be possible.  I can grab a few lvls with her this weekend so she has some IP to spare.

Bottom line is I don't want to gimp her during the "not much IP" times.  If this would mess her up maybe you guys can suggest someone to make this for me.  I went and got most of the parts last night.

Parts I have

1.  Carbonrich rock

3.  Photon Particle Emitter
4.  Neutron Displacer

Thanks for all your help!

Can a level 200 nanomage trader be be able to make nearly every item in the game?  

I'm really going between trader and engineer for my new toon, but just cannot decide what is best.  Trader seems a little more "fun" to play, but Im really interested in tradeskills.  Self reliance is important, and it appears that the trader is a lot more self relliant than an engy is (with maestros and all).

My goal, is to be able to make every item in the game with minimal outside help. Can this be done with a trader?

Thanks,

Pally

Maimgara @ 12/20/2002 8:45:14 PM (83401):
Yes.

Besides, playing a Engy to 200 is an excersise in mashocism.

Take my word, play trader: 

Insane skills for your level.
You'll be able to pvp (and be uber!).
Someone actually would like your buffs
You got tradeskill buffs (and can cast them very early due to drains)
The difference between engy and trader is small (>20 pts).

Thanks Cyber,

I took a look and the only think I could find was the section on Sealed Weapon Receptacles (http://www.anarchyarcanum.com/weapons.html).  Does that mean that all the little gadgets I have found that can be added to ranged weapons only work on "Unfinished" weapons?

Is it possible to add the ATC to an existing weapon I already own and use??

Thanks again.

Bear in mind that 2 other things influence your idea of rare - 

mostly the people running these missions dont know what  a PPPE is yet, and they get sold as junk 

Some people try to treat them as investments, spend a load of creds, then realize how much of a pain in the ass it is to run around with 900 in chemistry that they dont use it, cant resell for the GREED price they paid, and it goes in the bank to gather dust...

Xvi @ 12/21/2002 6:49:48 PM (82580):
I've blitzed lots of QL57, 59 and 60 missions for PPPEs ;D

QL57 and 59 seem to drop PPPEs more than QL60 missions do. (In my experiance)

Nevertheless, it usually takes 50-100missions per PPPE :O

if you prefer being able to build Bronto, Mantis and Dragon, why are you desparate to trade the Soft for a Hard ??

Doh.  Dont forget the Ncu Interface thing to activate the Nanobots.  This is a Unique item for god only knows what reason, so dont stuff it in a bag and forget about it, coz next time you wanna make your CAS, you will have to search your entire INV for the NCU Intetrface, coz you wont be able to buy another one, or trade one

Destractor @ 12/21/2002 7:46:53 PM (83533):
Basically yes

It is probably part of one of the many weapon construction kits. But very few of these produce weapons anyone will use, and the other parts will cost more than the finished weapon.

Selling trade skill items, like that, to shops is the best use of them.

The best QL mission to get GA1 and the PPPE's are QL56.  You'll get a level 60 boss every time.  I've done many on QL's ranging from 55-62, they all have varying boss levels except for QL56, which seem to always spawn the said level 60.  Many people have found GA1 and PPPE's on many other QL's though, I've heard as high as 72 and as low as 52, if I remember correctly.

I did 83 missions this way before I got a PPPE(soft).

so far it have been fairly succesfull but i never have been able to see what defines the requirements on the completed implant, right now im thinking : the highest QL cluster defines the implants requirement, regardless being shiny/bright/faded.
does any1 know if this is true? If not please lemme know what it is

Theres a subtle difference between Best and Easiest that some people can't see through the tunnel.

Breed only makes a big difference in NP, otherwise opifex/solitus are very close (sometimes equal or better) in everything else. Atrox are a fair bit worse though.

Doing the highest possible quality work means getting outside buffs one way or another, though which buffs (and how many) varies widely.

Oh and non-combat might as well be "non leveling". If you mean as little combat as possible, engineer can rely completely on the pet for awhile, but not forever without forgoing teaming. A non-combat trader will get lots of comments in teams from day one.

MPs have the exact same nanoprog skill as NTs.  Both have buffs, but the NTs highest level buff is usually only usable with an MP's buffs.  So I'd say it's a toss up between MP and NT

i meant it would be easier to get higher level, so you could start doing tradeskills faster, and i didnt know that stam was light blue to nano mages.

if you have more hitpoints, you dont die as fast, if you dont die as fast you dont lose xp as fast, if you dont lose xp as fast you will level faster.

Bzzt.  WRONG

Engie and traders main tradeskills cap at the exact same.  the sole difference is engies have a few uber rare hard to get items which add to the main tradeskills.

If you're going to be in a uber org who can hunt rare items on super hard mobs then the best tradeskill profession would be a engie.  Allowing you to get the absolute maximum tradeskills(except psychology)

However if you are in a relatively small org with some friends and won't really get a shot at those uber rare hard to get items then you are way better off going trader because you got maestros at the snap of your fingers.

Also when we eventually are capable of building towers of focus traders will once again get a large boost over engies due to their computer literacy buffs

In my opinion there is really no difference between engies and traders in tradeskills.  The only difference is the fact it is easier for traders because they have the buffs on them all the time.  There is very little difference between the skill maxs favouring engies slightly right now.  However as i mentioned with the focus tower it will close to even tighter.

I have a sure fire way for you to choose which prof you would rather be for tradeskills.  Would you rather have to bother people all the time for buffs(engie) or would you rather be bothered for wrangles and maestros all the time(traders). Thats the real question

KrazyKanuck @ 12/25/2002 9:23:00 PM (81997):
Whoops i just noticed you added another thing in a post later on.  you said something about towers.  Not sure if you meant making or placing them.  Anyways making them is roughly the same for both profs.  however placing them traders are 100times better.

My trader can smack down a ql250 cotroller(1.3k comp lit 1k psychology)  even a engie at level 200 could only dream of that.  Traders are WAY better at tower placing 

So if towers are what floats your boat then trader all the way.

1st Yeshua @ 12/26/2002 7:09:41 AM (Tradeskillerz Convention! 84766):
To all tradeskillerz,

  A very important meeting is being scheduled for Saturday January 11th, 2003 at 17:30 (GMT) near the Bronto Burger in Back Yard 1 in Borealis.

  We will be discussing possible ways to pesuade FC to make changes to their pollicies on trade skillz.

  We will hear suggestions on how to improve trade skillz.

  Specifically:

1.  we would like to see an increase in the amount of XP given for using tradeskillz; implant creation, weapons creation, treatment labs...etc.  The xp given should be no less than 25-50% of what would be earned if a mob of equivalent lvl were murdered.  In the case of an implant.  A LVL 200 mob might yield ~50k.  In turn The creation of a QL 200 Implant, all three slots included, should yield no less than 12.5K-25k.  As the system currently functions a full set of QL 200 implants would only yield roughly 30k.

2.  We would like to see a decrease in the costs of purchasig materials used in the trade skill process.  A reduction in cost, which would allow a trades person to sell an item for atleast 150-200% of what was spent in order to make the item. (re-usable resource not included, though the price structures of these items needs to be rethought as well).  Tradeskillerz should be able to make a real living at their trade.  We should not have to rely on tips for our services alone.  We're not waiters from goodness sake.

  As tradeskill enthusiasts we are tired of spending so much IP on tradeskills only for a negligible return on our investment.  We want Funcom to rethink their approach to tradeskillz as a whole.  It is our assertion that by improving the tradeskillz the social atmosphere of will be improved in like turn.  As more people participate in tradeskillz, there will be more player to player interaction, involving something other than gunfire, and it will add a whole new dimension to role playing that most have yet to experience in-game.

  All players, whether they directly participate in trade skills or not, will benefit from these changes, as they will no longer have to buy all items from the shops, and may find them even cheaper off of other players.  No more wasting money in shops, that just suck up money into an endless vacuous void.  That's right, these changes may assist in the development of a true player based economy, not one based on arbitrary numbers.

please send tells to Moesis or Aazamon in-game on the Atlantean server.

If you're a Rimor player and you're interested in contributing, just post here, and you will be contacted, include your in-game name- plz

Makarov @ 12/26/2002 2:07:57 PM (84376):
Are you talking  about Ability reqs (str,agi etc) or Treatment reqs?

Anyway when it comes to ability reqs then i can say you this. Every possible cluster combo in   each implant  are saved in Data base. And it dont matter   what cluster you add first. Wich means that. If you add S matcrea , B range ini and F sence you will get same  ability req as if you would add first F, S, B clusters.
It  is like math 1+2+3 will allways be 6 no matter how you  swap them.

When it comes to Req Values like  304 Ability +711 Treatment then. Those values are fixed for each Q  of implant. You can however raise Q of implant (and raise reqs att same time). When you have  more skill that is needed or have cluster that is higher Q that Implant.  What is exact formula for Q raising i dont know but i think  that it is % based so more skill you have  + higher Q cluster then the more  chance you have to raise Q.

If  you however need to  keep same Q of implant then you just need to get Clusters that are lower Q that implant. Those should never raise  implant Q (well they never did for me)

And when it comes to  q200 Implant making some   non informed ppl think that you need to have same Q cluster as implant.
Others  say that cluster  can be 10% lower that implant.
and Last ones says that it is 15% limit.
Well o can only say that   all 3 are wrong.

Shining Clusters can be up to 14% lower (q172 for q200 imp)
Bright Clusters can bu up to 16% lower (q168 for q200 imp)
Faded Clusters can be up to 18% lower (q164 for q200 imp)

Those values  was 100% right before  NW pack. And i think that they still apply.

This is wrong regards implants, sorry to correct it but I would hate someone to carry around false information.

The QL of implants will increase almost regardless of QL.  Implants will be bumped up depending on the Nano Programming skill of the person making them.  I bumped some QL70s up to QL72 only having ~530NP.  Anyone with 1k+ NP will easy bump the QL up around 3 (possibly 4?)

As a final thought, many sell their 'old' Carbonum armor on the boards, try and pick one up there.

That's because Level 150 people that have paid 80 million credits for a QL 60 tool don't want to be bothered with making Ql 10 armor. One of the many reasons I believe tradeskills are still borked.

Slyyk @ 12/28/2002 3:17:29 PM (85200):
While I realize there seems to be a somewhat small relation to tradeskills in this thread, I'd like to point something out here. Something that jumps out at me that shows perfectly how borked tradeskills are:

"Hi, I'm a level 82 <insert profession here> and I need alot of money in order to compete in the marketplace for the inflated economy. Can I get hints/tips to acquire a low QL, extremely rare item that is absolutely required by tradeskill armor makers so I can sell it for insane amounts of money? I know this doesn't help the overinflated economy any, but what else am I to do? I don't have the IP to raise tradeskills myself (noone under level 100 does to tell the truth) so there's no way in hell I'll ever use a PPPE. But people that are much higher level will pay huge amounts of money since it isn't possible for them to acquire this item any other way without spending hours and hours on alt characters to get this item. Any help/tips are appreciated."



Note: I am not flaming the person that started this thread in any way. I'm just pointing out how stupid the fact is that an item like this is so rare.

Examples...

"I did find a PPPE-Hard after about 50 missions (yay!). Traded it for a VTE (via auction here on the Rimor exchange). 
"

or

"I've blitzed lots of QL57, 59 and 60 missions for PPPEs ;D"

So, I know atleast they drop off of the boss, still wondering if you can find them in chests or off mobs...

Rubydoc @ 12/29/2002 5:15:08 PM (85200):
My five cents:

Farm dyna-camp bosses lvl 56-60. I heard somebody looted a PPPE shape soft off one not long ago. However, I am looking for the PPPE's in this fashion myself, and 3 weeks of farming has given me zit. I got some other good low-ql nanos and items, but no PPPE's. In any way, you'll be able to increase your assets somewhat...

And I agree:
I dare the GM's to loosen up on the more game-enriching items, as the tools and profession specific items who buff skills, though, since their present droprates are destroying an already too pressed economy, as previously stated in this thread. oh, well...


However: If anybody do find the PPPE shape hard armor in Atlantean, my engie - Catmech - will pay a corrupting amount of creds for it, and maybe still be happy...

edit: Catmech got the MRR shape hard now     85M poorer...

Simehiri @ 12/30/2002 9:20:02 AM (*CORRECT* procedure to make the Improved Immortal Katana? 85764):
Does anyone know, from first-hand experience, the correct procedure to obtain the Improved Immortal Katana? I had used the guide at www.anarchyarcanum.com, however, discovered that it's horribly wrong - in regards to the end result. Basically, following anarchyarcanum's guide; I got a quality 108 Faded Immortal Katana off of Jocosta, looted a quality 106 SSC reversive energy pack from the cyborgs in Perpetual Wastelands, and had an Engineer with over 900 in Mech Eng. install the pack, to which the end product SHOULD have been an IMPROVED Immortal Katana. Rather, what I got was just a high quality Immortal Katana. Quality 124, to be precise. 

     Now, although a quality 124 Immortal Katana is definitely a nice reward for some tradeskill work, considering that Jocosta normally doesn't seem to drop Immortal Katanas past quality 108, better quality for the original Immortal was not my aim, nor what I expected when reading the arcanum guide. I was after the IMPROVED Immortal Katana and still would much like to make it. 

      Is this the result of FunCom changing the procedure, or was this never the correct procedure to begin with? Personally, I had always theorized that improving the Immortal Katana would have had something to do with the MMR slashing disks. 

     Could I get some hard input on this subject once and for all?

Earle @ 12/30/2002 10:34:17 AM (85656):
Already maxed it =)

And some of the stuff we're able to make is great. Though making nanokits and free movement stims would really rock.

Wobble @ 12/30/2002 11:33:57 AM (85200):
I believe (but have not personally confirmed) that the PPPE's are boss loot only.  GA disks are completely different, they can drop from anything that drops disks.

Kzak @ 12/30/2002 11:42:17 PM (85764):
Yes, to make the Improved Immortal Katana you have to use a MRR (Improve Slashing Weapons) on it. That's the only way you can change a Broken Immortal Katana to anything else.

The can of red paint is bugged at the moment. It worked before the last patch.

I've spoken to the Arks about this, so at least they know. The Arks wouldn't reimburse my friend due to this bug. They just said to hold onto it until there is a fix.

+2 Intelligenge and Agility boosts

That's 901 (there are plenty of other ways to add to sense, int, etc - such as wearing more than 1 viral egg or using a brain - as well...I was just trying to get to 900 as quickly as possible)

The only conflict in this setup is it conflicts with your shining head implant (although, like I said, there are other ways to get your stats and skills up - quite easily, I may add...).

Krabbus @ 1/1/2003 1:05:31 PM (Immortal Katana and Slashing MRR 86325):
Hi, I have a QL72 Immortal Katana, but would like a bit higher QL, so I were thinking of improving it a bit.

This is what I know:

Broken Katana
This can be improved by using Mass Relocation Robot: Improve Slashing Weapons. The end result will be a Improved Immortal Katana around QL100. May get it up to QL125 if the broken version is high enough.

Faded Immortal Katana
I will say this is the best one to get, since this can be improved with a SSC Reversive Energy-Packs, the QL will raise, but it will also turn into a Immortal Katana


This is what I know, I don't dare to try to improve the regular Immortal Katana I got in QL73 with a MRR - since it's a possibility it will turn into a improved version. Do anyone have some info on this? 

Another thing, what is the spawnrate on Commander Jocasta that drop this katana?

If anyone is willing to exchange either the Immortal Katana QL73 or a Improved Immortal Katana QL109 with a QL90-100 Immortal Katana, and some cash, please send me a tell (Atlantean)

I am not fully aware of ql of different parts needed to make these towers. So I would like to know how high ql Corruption tower it is possible to build. 

What I understood that the final ql of the tower is determined by the ql of the program.  I also know that you need EE to use nanobots on the construction kit. 

Basicly I am trying to get ql 220-225 corruption tower up and need some advice so that I can get right parts/trader skillers. 

Questions:

1. How low quality can "Guardian Conductor Building Kit" be that it makes 220-225?

2. What skill is required to used to combine "Guardian Conductor Controller" with "Conductor of Corruption Program"?

3. What skill is need to combine "HSR Compressed Regenerating Plate" with "Programmed Guardian Conductor Conroller"?

KrazyKanuck @ 1/1/2003 11:16:08 PM (86432):
No one in the game can build a corruption tower that high, 210-212 would be the max for the super twinked engie whose org uses the tradeskills advantages.

markgagne @ 1/2/2003 2:09:12 AM (Question concerning Implant Disassembly Clinics 86474):
I have a question concerning Implant Disassembly Clinics and their usage. I am a level 171 engineer and, naturally, have invested a great deal of IP and time into tradeskilling. I do this primarily for the benefit of my guild, and rarely to earn personal profit from any other player. Nor do I practice tradeskills for the purpose of gaining XP.

My question is this: 

Implant Disassemly Clinics have a WEAR requirement of Fixer, but do not include any class restriction for use (according to the description of the item). Now, with the rumors about that some individuals have been punished by Funcom for using this item to powerlevel, and the additional fact that many bugs are not "common knowledge" (ie. does not work as intended), I am very interested in clearing up my personal concern of whether or not I would be allowed to use this item LEGALLY to strip implants.

Raising B&E is not a problem for me at L171, and naturally using this item would accomodate the fact that I can also assemble QL200 implants without outside help. The ability to also strip them would be a nice skill to offer my guild. We do have fixers available, but only one or two. This means that many of us are left searching for quite some time outside of the guild to have a "throw-away" implant stripped to usefulness.

I am not asking about the question of powerleveling via tradeskills, as that would be a separate discussion. I am simply concerned about whether or not Funcom intended for the clinic to be useable by ANY class that can meet the B&E skill. I have not done so yet, and will refrain from doing anything that would be deemed an "exploit" in game. Any feedback on this would be welcome, especially from a Funcom representative.

PS: I am not sure this is in the correct forum.

You gotta be kidding? Upto 25k for a single implant? As sensible as that might sound for someone who would want to just tradeskill all day, increasing the xp gained from tradeskilling will only lead to further exploitation of the possibilities tradeskilling does for leveling. 

Several people in the past have developed 3rd party utilities that does tradeskilling automatically and thus makes people able to "tradeskill" themselves without user interaction. This has in some cases led to people leveling a trader to level 100 in a matter of hours. Do you think that less people would exploit this if you increased the xp reward by 8 times?

1st Yeshua @ 1/2/2003 5:08:00 PM (84766):
Ultimately, Octo, I think the majority of people payed, and continue to pay for this game, because they enjoy 'playing' it.  No matter what you do to stop it, people will always find a way to exploit something in the game.  From day one, I've wanted to be a tradesman, as was promised on the box, as an alternate way of advancing...To date using tradeskills as an alternate method of advancing would be a ludicrous undertaking, if it is possible at all.

I, for one, am not in favor of limiting the experience of those who wish to play for the few that would abuse such a system.  It's like giving the power of authority to a minority that doesn't have the games best interest at heart.

Furthermore, the amount of xp given is just too little for tradeskills as a whole.  Tradeskillerz have to dump far too much IP into skills that yield nearly no xp in comparison to the ratios of xp yield involved in ordinary combat.  Whether an individual should get 10k or 25k xp per implant or cluster insertion is a mute point.  The idea is that 1k xp is no where near enough to justify the kind of IP expendature that a tradesman/woman invests.

Consider this...How many enforcers do you see investing in tradeskills?  I don't know of any...Why?  I believe it's due to the fact that, they are best suited for combat.  Just as Eng have an adantage in the area of tradeskillz.  Additionally, all non tradeskill classes rely on tradeskill classes to make the stuff they need to conduct their private wars.  The big question is why is there such a big diff in the xp yield for one proffesion doing what they're good at  compared to another.  Why is an entire community of players being ignored for providing services that everybody needs.  In the time that it takes to find parts and create a set of implants, the average enforcer can make 5-10 lvls.  And how many will I make, creating implants, in the same amount of time?  You guessed it, none!

Anyway, this thread is really for promoting the tradeskillerz convention, but to answer your question...  

NO! we're not kidding...

Happy New Year!  BTW

My point is that even enforcers may increase for instance nanoprogramming to level an alt if xp is increased. Wheter or not its dark blue or whatever really doesnt matter since he can RESET the tradeskills when he is done leveling in your system. This possibility does encourage exploiting of that fact far more in your increased xp system. Im quite confident that my view on this topic is shared by the developers at FunCom and I really don't see any change in this.

And since you bring up this "vast majority is beeing hurt by the few"-argument. Is it fair that the engineers/traders and the likes that consider themselves as tradeskillers and that are 200 or highlevel, and did that by killing monsters (like the rest of the planet), should see new tradeskillers powerlevel like crazy on tradeskills when they couldnt? Can you see that point?

But it doesnt matter really, Im just putting up my opinion, and I respect if you have another view on the situation. But Im VERY certain that we haven't seen the last of bans of people that leveled "too" fast on tradeskills. Increasing xp WILL increase that number, and would thus be bad business for FunCom.

1st Yeshua @ 1/2/2003 10:04:31 PM (84766):
However, I don’t claim to know how to balance such a shift in game play, what formulas to use, or even the exact numbers to use.  Yet, that doesn’t mean that something shouldn’t be done.  Whether or not you have a few Enforcers that raise IP in tradeskill areas just to lvl without having to fight, those who are faithful to tradeskills should be rewarded for their hard work.  Above and beyond this simple request, it’s up to FC to figure out how to implement it in such a way that it doesn’t upset the “balance” of the current system, if there is a balance at all.  We should not receive only a stipend for providing other players with the items they need, so they can run off and get 10-20 times the xp we get for providing those items.  I can easily waste an hour working on implants for someone, depending on how much work is involved.  In the same amount of time, I could have done a solo mission and lvld at least one time, and ultimately, that’s what it boils down to, time compensation…That and IP compensation.  If I put x amount of IP into something, there should be a reasonable return on my investment.  Nothing massive, but enough to justify the investment.

  It’s unfortunate that Funcom isn’t responsive to requests like this.  A month or so after I purchased the game a year ago, I began sending in feedback, requesting improvements in the implementation of the tradeskill systems.  They never did anything, and still haven’t, a full year later.  Does that mean I wouldn’t want new players to benefit from a good idea?  Not really, I could always start a new character and reap the benefits right along with them.  That’s like saying that high level NTs were upset when Funcom decided to add a nano programming buff to their line of nanos.  I sincerely doubt that you heard any NTs complain about that.

  Furthermore, I don’t really care how long it takes for other players to get to x level.  That’s not why I play.  My only complaint is that tradeskills, as they are currently implemented, don’t live up to the original promises of Funcom.  Tradeskills are a necessary evil as opposed to an alternate way to play the game.

Assembling and disassembling implants to get XP, and leveling by this method, is not considered an exploit.

Exceptions are - of course - if there is a bug involved e.g. giving you way too much XP, or you break some other rule in the EULA or the Rules of Conduct when doing this.

Just a few questions on these.  I have an engie on my guild that can easily make it, but I'm curious about the req's and bonus's a ql100 and a ql150 will give.

I've checked all the item databases, but they only show ql40's and ql200+

Here is what I need:

Complit/NP req for each
MC/TS bonus it will provide

I would assume a ql100 will give about +15, but haven't the first clue really.

Thanks!

Drusillus @ 1/3/2003 5:49:22 PM (86975):

Drsepsis @ 1/3/2003 6:13:54 PM (86871):
With a pham tech skill of about 1100 or so i can make any stims you could possibly use.  They require more First Aid then the normal stims.  A lvl 125 stim uses like 700 FA if i remember right (can't check now cause i'm on vacation at my parents house).  If your lookin to build them they are VERY VERY expensive.  

The nice thing about them is that they add both HPs and Nano...but its over a range.  So you have a chance of getting less nano or health then you would get from an equivalent standard stim.

You can put a ql 175 nanobot thingy into a ql 195 or so base thingy and then that would fit into the ql 210 corruption tower (needs 1215 or so EE.. I can't do it w/o org advantage set to EE). 

~Chris

Thelcia @ 1/4/2003 1:43:10 AM (86975):
Yeah, it is a 10% rule i believe.

So 10% of 210 is 21, so 210-21 = 189

Then 10% of 189 is 19 (or do 18 if you want to be safe), so 189-19 = 170. 

So you should be able to go as low as 170 or 171 nanobots for ql210 final, just need to get a 189 kit. 

I know you can use 180 kits to get 200 tho.

Darkbeak @ 1/4/2003 2:38:59 AM (82580):
Thats what i heard from some ppl who were able to get 5 pppe and 3 GA in 3 days: It helps a lot to run lvl 56/57 missions and to start with team of 6 AND a team lvl of 5 cause then u will get better loot table and more drops so ur probability of pppe/GA increases.

North @ 1/4/2003 11:51:36 AM (86975):
Quality of the final tower is not determined by the ql of Nanobots or the construction kit. The tower ql is determined by the Program. We did some testing...and it might just be possible to build a ql 213-215 corruption tower with org advange. 

First part is to make Conductor of Guardian Controller. Parts must be withing 10%

Part 1. Guarding Controller Building Kit (determines the ql)

Part 2. Cloud of Polychromic Nanobots (need to be withing 10% of the quality that Guardian Controller Building Kit has)

So you can get ql 180+ nano bots and apply them to ql 200ish construction kit. Construction kit determs the final quality for this part. To make ql 200 base requires 1150 in EE.

Second part. This is where you apply the right Guardian Corruption Program on Conductor of Guardian Controller. 

Parts must be 10% (I think)

You can apply ql 200 Conductor of Guardian Controller to at least 221 Program. This we did test (albeit did not meet the required EE skill)

The program you will use here is the one that determines the final quality of the tower. 

I think the first qualtity that adds 32 to both MC/TS when using corruption programs is ql 211.

I think when we did the first test with Megabio, the ql 221 tower would require 1270 in EE (for the second process). Correct me, if I am wrong.

Sorry for any confusing this late at night rambling might cause...

Jith @ 1/5/2003 8:07:43 PM (nano regeneration clusters broken 87609):
Ive been trying to complete my implants with clusters of nano regeneration.  They are not able to be combined.  Both my level 52 and 68 clusters say they must be combined with a level 100 implant and will not go in the level 50 implants I have.  They will also not go in level 100 implants when attempted as the cluster is too low a quality level.  

I have asked two people about this who both say they have petitioned about the matter.  The first one petitioned a week ago and was told it was a known, recent problem and they are unsure of when a fix will be out for it.  The second person petitioned 2 days ago and was told they are not aware of this bug and they will look into it; again, they have no idea when they might have a fix for the problem.  That is a contrdiction of what the first ARK said but I am told this is common.  

I have not seen anything on the forums about the problem but it appears many people are having it.  Even with the pharm skill, the clusters can't be put into the implants.  Has anyone gotten them to work since the last patch or within the last week?  If so, what qls?  Is there a link on the forum that I have missed where FC is addressing this issue?  Its difficult to make implants when they can't be completed :/

With ql97 the req's were under 400 in comp lit (should have checked but I forgot).  

Anyways a ql97 will give +14 mc/ts and was just enough with my +15 pillow and nelebs to self-cast cacodemon at level 125.

According to Jayde's site 209 is the lowest +32 MC/TS bonus tower.  Trust it if you want, but don't complain too loudly about it if it doesn't.

Just a quick point:
It's very easy to make things bot-proof. Anyone who's signed up for a Hotmail acct. lately will have seen how M$ do it using human-only readable text. That's just one way and I'm sure FunCom could come up with plenty more if they tried.

It's a real shame that Tradeskilling isn't a viable lifestyle in AO and if bots are FunCom's only reason for not implementing it properly then they are just not trying.

Several people in the past have developed 3rd party utilities that does tradeskilling automatically and thus makes people able to "tradeskill" themselves without user interaction. This has in some cases led to people leveling a trader to level 100 in a matter of hours. Do you think that less people would exploit this if you increased the xp reward by 8 times? 
			
		
	

I think that people should be able to level without doing the mission and hunting treadmill. The use of tradeskills to get xp should not be considered "exploting", any more than combat is considered exploitng.  

To your second point, I'm sure it's also possible to do combat macros too, although it may be somewhat more difficult; should we nerf combat xp because of the possiblilty of exploits?  I think that what makes more sense is adopting the policy that an ARK or GM should be able to contact you at any time during the game.  If you do not respond and it turns out you're using a macro, then ban the account.

Elbo @ 1/7/2003 9:14:26 PM (86975):
The 'putting' of the tower isnt the problem.  Its the creation requiring the massive EE of 1178 for a QL205ish for +31 MC/TS. I can hit (guessing) 1200 with a few buffs in EE or 1235ish with the EE adv put into place and a few buffs :-)

If funcom gave engi's one other item for HUD2 say a nice EE/ME/QFT item for nano creation it would really be a sweet and show the good will and loving in a serious fashion say a +120 version stackable with all the normal buffs... yeah that would be sweet. (see I'm asking for a mile but I'm expecting a +12).  If funcom couldnt manage that with stacking of current buffs please don't change anything... the nerf stick has fallen a few to many times anyways.

Slyyk @ 1/7/2003 10:01:34 PM (88204):
Currently these are only worth selling to shops. Unless you want to spend a whole bunch of money turning it into a Mass Relocating Robot which you can use to modify ordinary melee weapons (which noone uses) into modified and slightly better melee weapons (which noone uses). You can buy an MRR- Program List from a store to see which weapons you can currently upgrade. This device will supposedly refresh itself automatically as new weapons are upgradeable but hasn't done so since it was introduced several months ago.

Combat macros for AO would be next to impossible for mission-combat (since missions are always different in layout). Outside hunting would be abit easier, but to make something that can fight in for example a dynacamp and at the same time use nanos and healthpacks when hes not aggroed.... I don't think so.

Also, making a combat macro program would most certainly require the program to access the client-server datastream which is a bannable offence in itself. Maybe it would require to use some of the DLLs too, which the EULA clearly says you aren't allowed to.

User-input only programs, which are ideal for tradeskill-macroing, are easy to make in for instance Visual Basic, and don't require any interpretation of AO data. It would just need to know what key to push and what mousebutton to click. Several instances in the past have shown that tradeskill xp has been exploited in the past, so there is no reason to belive that that won't happen in the future. For instance, if you've been around for a while you would maybe have heard about the "Company" that made it into a business to level characters and sell them on eBay. Those used user-input macro programs to level chars to level 100 in a few hours, apparently using pixel detection.

What you are saying here, is that you want to be able to level without combat and because of that you are willing to ignore the ones that level chars by exploiting. To me it seems almost like saying that exploiting is ok as long as you don't have to do combat. 
But what it all boils down to is that FunCom must consider the point that I brought forward, and that increasing xp from tradeskills ultimately depends on wheter or not they can implement a tradeskill anti-exploiting system. If they are uncertain if exploiting might occur on a larger scale it would be better to leave the xp as it is now and not change it.

Im sure you realize what problems FunCom would have with increased exploiting if xp is increased?

It was outdoor hunting I had in mind, right.  I agree that missions would be extremely difficult to code for. Outdoor hunting would be hard but not impossible to code; I have afew thoughts on how you could do it but would prefer not to share because of the danger someone that might actually implement it.

Clicksaver does exactly this, despite the EULA's warning.  I consider it an invaluable tool, and not an exploit at all.  I'll freely admit to using Clicksaver, and if that gets me banned then it's on to the next game I guess.  My point is that there are constructive exceptions to the EULA like Clicksaver and Damage Dumper, and then there are apps that can and should be banned like tradeskills and combat macroing.

On this we agree; I think you're right that it has happened before and will likely happen again.  However, I do not think that it therefore follows that all must be penalized for these actions. Ban those who do it! Don't nerf everyone because of a few rotten apples.

Exploiting is a fact of life in any MMORPG. There are plenty of combat exploits out there right now!  I do not condone them, but I also do not think it's appropriate to nerf combat XP just because it's  exploted and exploitable. It follows then that the same reasoning should apply to tradeskills.

It does increase the incentive, admittedly.  However, I still come back to the same point that even if some people take unfair advantage of the increased xp, the damage to the community is less than the damage done by continuing with nerfed xp for tradeskills.  It is a net gain for the community to have a more robust tradeskill avenue, exploiters or no.  By the way, I'm an atrox enforcer so unless I can build something by jamming my beam into it, I doubt that I personally will be doing tradeskills any time soon. It's not for myself that I'm advocating this, but for all the people for whom combat is a secondary concern in the game. 

On implementing an anti-exploiting system, what do you think of my earlier proposal?  That would be to add a point in the EULA that you must be reachable by an ARK or GM at any given time you are online.  If you do not respond and it's clear that your toon is doing something, The GM or ARK can pretty easily see if you are perfoming multiple continued repetitive actions.  Accounts that show this Macro behavior should be given a warning and then banned the second time.

Since the lowest rocks are around the 4 Holes area, I was thinking of going there but I see it's in omni territory (easier for omni to mine there?) and I also hear 4 Holes is a big PvP area.  Or I can go to Avalon area, but the mobs are way too high there.  Is there any way a low lvl Clan character (20-30's) can get to these rocks?  Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

iguanoid @ 1/10/2003 2:07:54 PM (89052):
mmm solo missions huh/....
whats the lowest mission someones found em in??

Master Mbutu @ 1/10/2003 2:32:20 PM (89052):
I did a lot of missions with setting to full XP and didn't fine any 'Gift Wrapped Baskets'.

Then I changed the settings to full Money and full Bad, and then I found one in my first mission.

I think they come in all QL missions, myself have found them in 10-50, 130ish, 150ish and 190 / 191's.

Often in chests which are not locked.

With full bad full money setting I think you got a 50% chance of getting one.

iguanoid @ 1/10/2003 2:51:56 PM (89052):
nice - i will try those settings for a few missions, and see what i turn up

rocks can be found in the Subway (if you are L24 or below)  also in missions and off MOBs and in chests.

can you get to the area in Broken Shores by way of the clan BS whompa?

also, I assume you have Dovve's word map which has the locations marked

4 holes shouldnt be to bad for you.  I know avalon can be bad...  BS isnt to bad.. CAV : Death trap if you cant mez and have to walk into under lvl 100.

Harkone @ 1/10/2003 9:49:37 PM (87970):
Hehe Krappus. That must have been... interesting.

Are there any other items out there that increase NP? (Aside from the various buffs and implanting)

Just curious how else I can jack my NP.

makhina @ 1/10/2003 10:06:00 PM (88984):
I'd recommend 4 holes, but do not try to get there via whoompa. you will be shot. instead, whompa into stret west bank and run (takes awhile) south and south some more and approach 4 hole from the north east. the rocks are just all over the place.

BigGreen @ 1/10/2003 10:17:35 PM (89052):
Try also "Full Hidden" to get the max number of chests.

Nooki @ 1/10/2003 11:06:09 PM (87970):
Biggest buff is the 1000 token board for +210.
Tutoring can give you +50 nanoprogramming.
Do a search in Jayde's Database for complete listing

Good luck.

NeckWringer @ 1/11/2003 5:57:15 AM (Tutoring Skill Values 89320):
Can anyone tell me approximately what increases the tutoring skill will give at various points along the curve?

100 tutoring
200 tutoring
300 tutoring
etc.
 

Or anything you want to throw in.

KrazyKanuck @ 1/11/2003 6:23:30 AM (89320):
I'm pretty sure its linear and not a curve.

QL * 5 = tutoring skill required

QL/4 = skill buff

So essentially tutoring / 20 = skill buff.

1k tutoring = 50 skill buff.

KrazyKanuck @ 1/11/2003 6:25:54 AM (88592):
Tradeskills are excellent for leveling at low levels.  would be even better if we got the XP side bonus,

I would go as far to say pre-50 tradeskills are the absolute fastest way to level without exploiting. 

your right for my 176 trader and 174 engie tradeskills give no XP but what i am saying is the side XP and token board and IQ ring would be a good start for XP from tradeskills.  And if you are just gonna turn that down then i guess i am gonna have to say you are just a moron.

KrazyKanuck @ 1/11/2003 6:27:08 AM (88787):
time to get rid of blindness from them.

I think the cost and increased time in between uses and the fact you have to hunt down the parts is cost enough for them.

Mercatura @ 1/11/2003 8:36:59 AM (89320):

Kzak @ 1/11/2003 12:31:16 PM (89382):
For CAS armor QL200, I usually charge 500k per armor piece converted. Only fair for changing into implants and using tutoring devices to boost my Chemistry to 900+.

I did some research to find out what the going rates are, and made this post in the Atlantean Market forum


these seem to be the going rates:

Carbonum Armor = 1k * QL * #of pieces
Bronto Armor = 1k * QL * #of pieces
Flesh Hoods = 1k * QL 
Modernized ICC Cloaks = 200K 
Dragonflesh Armor = 2 mil

Virral Triumvirate Egg = 1 mil 
Implant Disassembly Clinic = 1k * QL

Weapons

hacking Sealed Weapon Receptacles = 100K (if it's not part of one of the above processes)

Medical
Emergency Treatment Labs = 1k * QL 
Stims and Kits = 1k * QL 

NF's

Docmax @ 1/11/2003 5:57:44 PM (89320):
if you go to http://aomainframe.info  and search for tutoring device, you can make it show you intermediate QL's and it will estimate how much it will give you

I used this kick ass feature to find out what QL I can use, which is QL 135 for all but 1 of the tradeskills, EE, obviously (which conflicts with shining tutoring)


also you can do /tell itemsbot search 117 nano prog tutoring

and it will show you a QL 117 version you can click on

Neurofreeze @ 1/11/2003 8:55:34 PM (89382):
I don't think doing free complex/hard/long tradeskilling is a good idea. 

Easy and quick stuff is fine, like doing one implant or doing <=QL100 stuff (stuff that generally requires no effort or buffing, takes very little time, and numerous people can do), but doing higher level stuff for free just undercuts those people who use tradeskills as a one source of income.  I don't see it as just being nice.

I'm not a tradeskill person (yet, I'm building up an ENG, for better or worse), but I gladly pay those people who are tradeskill adept.

There's no 'Engineer' requirement on the solar-powered pistol - anyone with enough skills can use it.

Addendum: To increase the pistol's level (via right-clicking until you have to perform a tradeskll-process to change the weapon's class once the cap is reached), you need Weaponsmithing skill - up to 940ish max. Thus, this pistol is only for those who are willing to have a very high Weaponsmithing skill and can wield the pistol afterwards (941 req).

Also, it is NODROP, so you can't get someone else to raise it for you.

Kzak @ 1/12/2003 3:16:45 PM (89382):
One million for a Virral Triumvirate egg?

Considering most sub-TTL6 people need Maestros to do those, and likely have to pay 250k per maestro, that leaves the Engineer with little left..

I agree that many of those prices seem to be somewhat low.

Quick-and-easy stuff, I don't charge much for. But if I have to change implants, the price rises.

The improve discs are relatively easy to find, they can be found as mission rewards and off normal mobs at certain qls.

I think 10,20, and 30 are the qls you can get them in mission rewards...

Shantan @ 1/12/2003 6:59:54 PM (85200):
iamblades, in case you dont have an answer yet, the discs you are looking for can be found in QL10 missions (or thereabouts). I found Improve Crushing Weapons on a mob in a QL9-11 mission, but can also be found on boss. 

Rare, but not PPPE rare from what I've seen.

1) Is the 10% rule valid for all parts? 
e.g. Can you use a ql144 Steiner Flexipus Chassis, etc?

2) Likewise.. will 10% "stepping" work:
Can you use ql144 Notucom Wire to build the meshes? (as in: this would allow the use of ql130 cold stones for the mesh)

So essentially they made the skill moot.

You can raise all your skills 50 points cheaper than you can raise tutor to 1000.

Can we get a comment from the desing team about this.

NeckWringer @ 1/13/2003 4:59:59 AM (89382):
Ya that is sort of stupid. You know i spent 1.2 million on the robot to make my soft armor shaper and it's done me NOOO good whatsoever. I could be driving a new yalmaha right now instead of blitzing dang omni pol.

Oh ya i got a set of low 30s bronto for my trader after 5 hours of bronto slaying and because i kept every piece of hide i ever got. She needs new armor too. That lasted about 8 hours of game play.

Armor, implants, guns it all goes way to quick at the begining and takes just as much time to get it. You spend very nearly as much time getting a set of 39 armor as you do 90 armor and it only lasts a day or 2 on the character while the 90 armor can be on you for a week or two.

Using IP for trade skills is stupid. They need to add trade points and use them as a buff up to the trade skills and give them for every combine. It would go into the skill point system easily. just limit spending trade points on trade skills and just add them to the base. Make it so you still have to spend ip there though. make it a half and half rule.

NeckWringer @ 1/13/2003 5:18:05 AM (New Trade skill 89872):
You need to add blister packs to trade skills. Take one nano formula. Hack it. (everyone has that skill) Combine it with a pill pack (expensive one) and viola 100 charges of that nano program. You must be that profession and be able to cast that spell to make that blister pack though. No skill requirements for using them. Requires half the nano cost of the formula to cast,  that will keep low levels from using super high HoT blister packs.

That way you can actually have nano regeneration without spending 40 minutes hunting down an NT. Which btw are going extinct. Give that class some love.

Enforcers enlarges without hunting down enforcers.
Doctor treatment buffs without hunting down doctors.
Yes buy them now. It's wrangle in a can.
Enhanced senses in an easily digestible pill form.
Yes it's new improved Karma harvest in liquid gell form. No more vomiting.
Feline Grace chewables. (may cause nervous tremors and hairball sensations in the throat and mouth. side affects are similar to an enlarged NT's itchy prostate while taking sugar pills).

Stop the shopping channel whine. Get coding.
The wrangle would be cool because you could only cast it on other people that would keep you from just running around with 131 wrangle pills and power leveling.

And lets face it. If high level people want to hack up 800 thousand dollar nano formulas and use them on twinks. Then who cares.

Hmmm to bad the facts don't support that statement.  NTs are at their highest % of the played profs in 10-11 months.

Reading this later i don't know why i made that flame but oh well 

Anyways neat idea.  Obvious some nanos would have to be held back because of the fact that makes the prof obsolete.

Perhaps only buffs which increase base abilities and tradeskills??

gwend @ 1/13/2003 6:18:46 AM (89872):
what would be the point of using prof specific nanos then if everyone could each others nanos for half the skill required 

everyone would go atrox enf and use trader drains doc init debuff and tms pretty unbalanced dont you think

though i wouldnt mind casting maestros on myself when ever i needed it

Sheffy @ 1/13/2003 6:34:12 AM (89872):
Err, no.  Then who would want to play an Agent?  

This is a silly idea, no offense.  We have classes for a reason.

gwend @ 1/13/2003 6:59:36 AM (89320):
the intent of tutoring wasnt so you could skip putting ip into some skills it was for when your  capped on a skill 30 points short of making an item and you still have a way to get just a few more points

i use tutoring all the time to make some pieces of vt eggs that are little higher than my capped triple implanted and buffed skills can handle the +20 from tutoring puts me 1-2 points over what i need

using tutoring in place of spending ip in a skill imo is stupid and was never ment to work like that

who is slaggie?

I'd love to have a better list of prices, something people will expect and yet will make it worth my time.

I to think my price list above is too cheep.  I spend 30 minutes sometimes for some 1 mil tip.

I can make an easy 5 mil/hour blitzing missions, so I think this would be a good metric.  If I spend 30 minutes, I should make at least 2.5 mil for my tradeskills, otherwise what is to keep me from just blitzing missions instead?  other than I like helping people out?

who is this slaggie?  I'd like to see his/her price list and I'll gladly revise mine.

PS:  nevermind, I found who you are talking about, Superslang, and it looks like he only charges tips for almost everything, no help there, KrazyKanuck

Docmax @ 1/13/2003 8:25:23 AM (89320):
it just occured to me over the weekend that I can use shining/bright/faded tutoring and use the tutoring device, then quickly put in my EE implants, for example, and have the highest possible tutoring.  So with a base of 450 tutoring, I could get about 830 utoring with implants and pioneer backpack

KrazyKanuck @ 1/13/2003 9:40:43 AM (89382):
yeah "tips" is his usual response to enquiries about his prices 

Better off asking how much he usually gets tipped for a job or how much he thinks he deserves for it

rickenbacker @ 1/13/2003 9:55:29 AM (88787):
Isn't this kind of meaningless, like the blindness traps on chests. When you have the time to open chests the blindness is just a pointless distraction anyway, since all you have to do is wait for a while until it clears. I'd imagine it's the same with these kits, it doesn't actually do anything but annoy (and cut into your profits :-))...

Kzak @ 1/13/2003 1:34:01 PM (89320):
Indeed, Tutoring is a handy skill for getting points above your normal skillcap.

E.g. with a QL200 Nano-Programming tutoring device, I can get +50 to my NP skill - and these days I can raise it up to 1220ish, self-buffed. Over 1300 with Advanced Symbol Manipulation.

Look at it this way: For spending the IPs to get one skill very high, you can get a +50 bonus to any one other tradeskill. Sounds like a good tradeoff to me.

Kzak @ 1/13/2003 1:40:26 PM (58972):
Update: Can combine the regenerative Jobe-implants now (maxed Pharma-Tech), but need Maestro to do Shining QL200 ones.

Can make soft armors up to QL200, also CAS armor.

910 self-buffed B&E, can clean implants up to QL190.

iguanoid @ 1/13/2003 2:03:25 PM (89382):
yup, have to agree anyone only charging 1 mill to make a VTE is imo slightly mental....

especially considering some people turn upexpecting it tobe easy foryou to run ql 240 gold thru a wire drawing machine.  Its pretty tough for most normal people to polish ql 200 soulfrags let alone process ql 240 gold 

minimum price for this should be around the 3mill mark.
for armour, anything over ql 100 should be around 2k / per ql especially for non clanners 

And im no longer going program and combine sentient coldstones for stupidly small tips.  Like i dont know you expect me to build most of your Stilleto for under 25k a click - u know who you are....

And as forall your dirty Fixers out there who consider a 50k tip sufficient for the 132 u need to cast your GA 3, well just forget it and go find someone who needs 50k.  Im not interested in 50k tips for you to equip your 150+ mill GA3...

iguanoid @ 1/13/2003 2:20:21 PM (89779):

3) What level should we be to do this?

I was in the middle of a big move on the day of the event, and I got my wires twisted.  Please forgive me for not being present at the time of the happening.

We will be rescheduling soon.

Please use this time to spread the world about this thread, and contact me in game or Omar7.

I really want to present a strong unified case to Funcom about this issue.

I realise that it may sound futile, to say the least, but at some point they have to recognize what the players want.  This means there has to be a lot of us who are being squeaky wheels about this issue.

There is a whole community of players out there who are being ignored and it's time we stood up to be counted.  The time of the tradeskiller has come!

BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!

Docmax @ 1/13/2003 4:50:03 PM (89382):
good advice, I'll update my price list

my goal is to charge what most people charge

I'm not out to make a profit, since I could easily blitz missions for much better money (but I want to have prices that makes people feel like they are getting their money's worth.)

As for "I accept tips" that just sounds greedy to me, like you're saying "I'm taking a gamble you will tip me way more than the value, so I'll keep my mouth shut and hope for high money"

Personally, I like knowing the price ahead of time, when I go to get a service from someone.  That way I know I'm both not being ripped off, and not cheating the maker out of a fair compensation.

KrazyKanuck, feel free to have your slaggie post here, I'd love to hear his price experiences.

Docmax @ 1/13/2003 5:01:35 PM (89382):
ok, here is my updated price list

from Docmax's Tradeskill Services 


Armor:

Anyone know what tradeskill this "nugget" requires and what it is used for?

P.S. Anyone want to purchase this?

Docmax @ 1/13/2003 7:15:53 PM (90013):
QL 41 Small Gold Ingot should fetch about 4000 cr's from the machine (depending on your CompLit skill)

the ones above QL 190 can be used for making Virral Triumvirate Egg

the ones below can be used for jewery making, I believe, see Jewelry & Gem Refining

Mercatura @ 1/13/2003 9:37:59 PM (89320):
It was actually meant to let you help other peoples skill as well as your own (imagine charging for it, esp CL tutoring) but some nasty bugs were exploited so it was nerfed to fix that.

Don't think it was ever meant to replace spending into tradeskills at all, esp since everyone has it green.

What we really need is treatment tutoring devices, that would make up for the nerf-fix

Hodelay @ 1/13/2003 10:25:50 PM (90032):
Good question.  From what I have seen all the Guards/Patrollers are level 150+ but they do drop Nanobots from QL 100 - 200.  Perhaps you can buy the low QL ones from someone to make your guardians.

Hodelay @ 1/13/2003 10:45:34 PM (89382):
The policy I usually follow is if I can make the item without an implant swap then I will do it for free/tips.  I am very reluctant to make anything that requires an implant swap as it is a hassle not only in swapping your implants but the headache you get from dealing with "problem" customers. 

Most of the credits I have made from tradeskills are from selling items I have pre-made such as Treatment Library, Maussers and Carbonum sets.

Docmax @ 1/13/2003 10:57:22 PM (89382):
I do the same, but I have my list above for when people need a price to base their tips off of

trade skilling is no way to make money. but it's fun helping people (most of the time)

Hodelay @ 1/13/2003 11:05:03 PM (84734):
So far the only two pieces I have been able to obtain are Superior Sentinel Armor Sleeves and Superior Sentinel Armor Gloves.   

Here's how you get them:
On the west side of Avalon there is a small Omni base (spot marked "Buildings" if you're using Dovve's).  Kill all the Guards/Patrollers and eventually Major Copperfield (not positive with his ranking, might be a Sergeant) will spawn.  Kill him and he will drop either DNA locked Omni Gloves or Sleeves.  Turn them into Smug and he will give you the Sentinel's version of the armor.  All the mobs at this base are level 150 or a little higher.  Copperfield is a little harder than regular mobs but not my much.  

Don't know the details on how to get the Omni armor as I am a Clanner. I assume you can gather other pieces through killing simliar bosses or via quest.   The chest piece is obtain from doing a quest for HighCommander Fredrickson.  Also note that the armor has a title 6 req on it.

Im going to vote for a tutoring treatment device and also for one that allows engineers to raise up thier nano skills to make big robots. Put those stupid metaphyscisists out of business. Oh i don't play an engineer btw.

Do you have to meet 75 percent requirements on pets or you lose them? Why do engineers go with metaphysicist buffs? Why not just wrangle up the pet? Or do both if you have the NCU space? Why not just let engineers tutor themselves into higher pets?

Oh and put tables and chairs EVERYWHERE as a nerf to them. And those signs on bridges over doors Clearance 4' 6".

Why not take your world builders who spends all thier time putting up miles of fences to pee me off and making big rock boulders all the way around mission locations so you have to run all the way around them. Why not take thier drugs away from them and make them build practical thoughtful, usefull worlds. I'll beat them with sticks if you need someone to do that for ya.

Wrangles, maestros, philosophers stones, big essence's, iron circles, stuff like that.

Oh wait those are general formulas, why do they EVEN HAVE SYMBIO GRAFTS and PILLS for those.

I'm relatively new to tradeskilling and all I really do is Implants with my NT. Given that, I usually advertise that I'm putting them together. I used to advertise that I'd take tips, but like you said, that just felt greedy.

If someone offers to tip on the other hand... I'll accept . And to be honest, I've yet to have someone run off with out handing me something.

Still, your point about pricing in advance is a good one. But it sort of takes the fun out of doing a good deed and just helping someone out.

and you get people that think you are greedy for charging a pre-set price instead of just trying to "help out another player"

and if you don't mention price at all, you get people that don't pay you anything (even after putting out the extra effort)

so the question is, how do you ballance these types of clients?

I think there's another question too, and that's: 

How do you balance it for the different traderskillers?

My general take on the tradeskilling economy in MMORPGs is this:

As a consumer, I'm almost always going to go to someone that I either know or has set prices AND is well known. The last thing I want is for some piece of gear (ie GA) that I've shelled out some obscene amount of cash for, or spent hours farming to be ninja'd away.

As a provider (which is really the point here), I don't play MMORPGs to tradeskill so it's not the primary point for me in any game--for some folks, it may be very different. It's a decent means to raise _some_ cash, but you can definately do better blitzing missions or farming for some piece of gear. So to me, I provide services because I can. Tipping is something that is wholly optional, entirely appreciated, and will never be advertised for (from here on out). Mind you, I only tradeskill Implants as an NT, so it's very different for me. 

For traders/Engi's and the MP's who are spec'd to tradeskill, I think pricelists are probably a very good idea. You've got a wider range of services to provide and some of them are (pardon me) a complete pain in the... you know what. You've spent IP and time and effort to learn the recipe's and that has value. In a free market economy, you're entitled to a price list of some sort. Setting some sort of standard is probably a good idea, but that's going to be driven by market conditions anyways.

I wouldn't view that as greed, just common sense.

Hodelay @ 1/15/2003 8:09:35 PM (89382):
My suggestion is to be honest with your customers.  If you say “Accepting Tips” then accept whatever they give you if anything at all.  Don’t tell them you are accepting tips then give them a snide remark if you don’t think they gave you enough.  “Suggested Tips” is complete BS. The word for that is Payment so just tell your customers the amount you want for your services.  If they think it’s fair they will request your services if not then they will look for the service elsewhere.  No misunderstanding either way.   If you BS your customers don’t be shocked if they call you a greedy a-hole etc.

Just be honest with how much you think your time is worth.  There are some items (VT Egg, Nanos, Mausser) that require multiple skills with make in which case I will charge more for.  Don’t sweat it if someone says you’re charging too much and JoeTradeskill doesn’t charge at all.  No problem, just politely tell them you won’t be able to do business with them at this time.  Bottom line is you don’t get upset because you wasted your time with doing a service you feel under paid for.  My pricing generally reflects whether or not I need an implant swap to make. You can check out my pricing under my signature.

Of course the flipside of this is if you are a customer DON’T BE STINGY!!  If you are a high level character or have high level characters and you run around not tipping or tipping 50k don’t be surprised if you don’t get a response the next time you need a service.

Just make a macro saying:

/macro#1 You will tip me well for anything that requires ALOT of skill (700 and above).  If you don't tip me well you will find yourself on my ignore list.

/macro#2 Below 700 in skills requirements you can tip me something over 100K but below 10M for my time since I can probably make more looting a body in a mission than standing here debating pricing.

BTW: Had a lvl 150ish soldier tip me 50K for making a QL200 weapon yesterday... PATHETIC.  I told him so in no uncertain terms.

^^ That would be the ignore key... I use it for people who say thanks after I implant swapped or wasted my time getting maestroes and implant swapping and then making a QL212 nano (LW or Kels Plaything) and the guy saying.. well so and so does it for free.

since it only takes a L 150+ soldier 4 minutes to go blitz a QL 200+ mission and make 500K selling the reward item to the machine

and since it can take over 4 minutes to make some items

maybe you need a script that says

Not all, but a great deal of things are found out on Test and/or by combing the database. Though even that involves some trial and error.

Wyetookay @ 1/19/2003 12:29:32 AM (80568):
I think most of you are forgeting something: Armors
True traders can buff most trade skills exept for Chemestry, which is used to make just about every kind of armor in the game. True, our Philosopher's Stone buff doesn't even come close to being a maestro, but so far, it's the best chem buff in the game.

So i still contend that engies are better then traders. Not to mention that we are so used to buff begging that finding some kind soul to buff our trades is almost second nature

KrazyKanuck @ 1/19/2003 2:12:08 AM (80568):
Engineers are the best for making the extreme top end towers because of the few small buffing items they have.  In all other situations traders are superior except in chemistry.  

For most tradeskills the traders can reach the target skill required self buffed(or atleast with just SFA)  while the engie will need to find a trader to get the same buffs.  Yes the engie can get say 25 points more in a skill but whats the difference between 1050 and 1075 when you only need 1000 to begin with.

So if you plan on playing your character to level 200 and continuing to play on from there and doing towers ql200+ for people then engineer would be the best profession for tradeskills.  However if you are like 99% of the playerbase and won't make it to level 200 and/or you like to PvP sometimes then trader is the way to go.

Engies are ALOT harder to get to level 200 as well.

Jaesic @ 1/19/2003 10:37:56 AM (91324):
At the moment, there's no real point in building service towers.

I've done some experimenting with the little buggers and talked with a GM about the results but basically got blown off and told to send in a feedback email... and as usual, nothing seems to get done from those.

The problem that exists is this:

The shops currently carry on a few limited ql varieties of libraries. Specifically, they only carry two versions that are above the stock versions that you can buy as completed service towers (150 and 225)  The 150's require ME in the mid 800s.

Where the situation gets messy is that while the shops sell a wide range of shells for these service towers; the ql of the brain (made by using the quested tuner on the library) ALWAYS defines the ql of the end result. Thus... using tradeskills it is only possible to make ql150 or 225 service towers. 

As if this flaw isn't bad enough... completed service towers are not stackable (and like ready made ones, single use only). A lot of trade skill work for a very limited use item... 

Hopefully FC will recognize the need to make the end result reflect the items... perhaps the service tower's own defensive capabilities defined by the shell and the buff it produces defined by the library level. Probably too complex for the way items seem to be created though.

I have a Soft Pepper pistol sealed receptacle, Q79, which I want to turn into (ideally) a Q51 final pistol. I have seen mention that the final quality is mostly determined by the Nano Pylon quality. But I have seen several claims of ending up with a final weapon quality *lower* than the add-on part quality...
So, my question for you experienced tradeskillers out there is, do I need a Q51 Nano Pylon, or somewhat higher to try to end up with a Q51 pistol? (Or as close as possible without going under Q51!)

Kzak @ 1/20/2003 11:08:52 AM (92136):
The QL of the finished weapon is 100% dependent on the QL of the part.

Thus, if you have a QL200 receptacle, hack it open (let's say it's a Pepper Pistol), and combine it with a QL51 nano-pylon, the final result is a QL51 Pepper Pistol.

Ok, thanks for the info. 
That seemed to make the most sense, but searching the boards found a couple of reports of the final quality ending up lower than the part quality... However, those reports were early ones right after the Sealed Weapons became available, so maybe it was changed at some point or else the reports were in error... ?

Oh, also I'm assuming you can't combine an unfinished weapon with a *higher* quality part to get a higher-quality final product? I haven't seen this explicitly stated anywhere.

A good place to find them are the human mobs in the 20k outpost in PM.  They are the right level to drop the weapons discs, and that's where I got my 3.

I cant use this 
A Shining JobeCluster of Defencive Mastery - Refined 

As the skill needed for Shining 200+ Refined Implants is higher than I possess even teoretically.

What I can make, with some tweaking is say a ql 196 implant using A Shining JobeCluster of Defencive Mastery 

So be sure to differ between Refined and non refined shining Jobe Clusters.

Shanawa @ 1/21/2003 2:22:56 PM (3rd floor trade terminals same stock as 1st floor ? 92682):
I've just started looking for implant parts and have noticed most of the time in basic and advanced stores the terminal on the 3rd floor in the trade section has the same stock as the 1st floor one. Is this a bug or the way it is supposed to be ? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense to put a 2nd terminal on the 3rd floor if the stock is the same.

Shadelore @ 1/21/2003 2:36:33 PM (91101):
Feel free to send me an ingame tell.

Docmax @ 1/21/2003 4:52:41 PM (92682):
most of the time they are different, sometimes they are mirror images

if no one is in the store, the inventory wil change after 2 minutes

Tinkka @ 1/21/2003 9:04:43 PM (92136):
The QL of the final product is the QL of the lowest part you're combining.

The only exception are Soft Pepper Pistols. They only go up to Q194 max even if you are using Q200 parts..

According to the AO Armor Database, you can get Omni-AF armor from killing Omni guards and from Supplymaster Eel in Avalon.  Sentinel armor is available from Clan guards and from Smug in Wailing Wastes.  Also, that website says that the armor is only available at QL200. 
			
		
	
I needed to update that column; it was true for the first implementation of the Eel/Smug quests, but this led to a lot of people just killing their same side guards to get the armour.  Tir was a bloodbath.  Patch 14.73 changed it to have the DNA-locked stuff, which is not equipable as armour and must be turned in to the appropriate supplymaster to get the wearable armour.

Really cool database, great way to compare armor.

I know azure rocks, and was curious how it compared to the rest. Are you going to be adding it in the future?

What are the current appropriate prices to pay a tradeskiller for various jobs, on each dimension?  Assume that all parts are provided.

* Instruction Disc
* Implant Disassembly Clinic
* Treatment Library
* Virral Egg
* Implant combining
* Implant stripping
* Jewelry
* Sealed Weapons
* Improving Weapons
* Plasma
* Med kits
* Armours
* Overtuning tank armour
* Service towers
* ... anything else I am forgetting

I managed to deeply offend a tradeskiller I respect this weekend by offering a tip for a completed job that was insultingly low to him, so much so that he put me on his ***** list.  Here it is four days later and the whole thing is still troubling me, and I'd dealy love to avoid doing that again in the future.

Yes, I'm slowly adding in some things that have been missing for a while.  In particular, the original table on which it was based had only Urban Battle Suit, and I only recently added the rest of the Battle Suits -- which have been in the game a lot longer than Azure.  Ditto with the cloaks table; from its inception it didn't have the Omni-Tek tanks (my clan bias shining through), but this past weekend they were finally added.
 
Mostly the issue is that I want to balance time working on the tables with actually playing the game. 

You will also enjoy a neat new feature Jayde is adding to aodb.info, but I'll pretend I'm under NDA and just wait for him to show you all.

Darn.  Looked for a rooted thread and didn't see one, scanned through the thread titles on the first page and missed that.  Sorry.

A rooted thread would be very useful.

Among other characters, I run a midlevel trader, who just so happens to be mainly oriented towards the construction of tradeskill items.  She does a great deal of work for members of her clan and assorted passers-by and she does it at whatever tips the customer can comfortably afford.  She only requires that her customers bring their own material components, as she is not fool enough to spend money to finish a project that she is not going to be using.

NO, she is not wealthy.  But she is provided for by her clan and her customers, which is quite enough.  You people with your outrageous fees and your indignation at the size of donations and payments are the reason that PPPEs cost the ridiculous amounts that they go for.   You create your own inflation on these tradeskills tools that are not machine-buyable and you inflate the already bloated and skewed RubiKan economy by being so mercenary.

It is unreasonable to ask a large sum of money from people who have already depleted their funds by buying the needed parts to bring to you for construction.  Do not cry foul on those who ply their trades to the common masses for fun rather than profit because they undercut your inflation.  If you want that much cash, make friends with good blitzers who have money they don't mind buring on you as patrons instead.  Or just make an agent or fixer and get your own credits the honest way and PRAY that you run into an honest tradeskill practitioner when YOU need grid armor or a nano made up for you.

Those who are honest and not greedy tend to find themselves the recipients of many useful gifts from repeat customers, as people tend to remember those who are always open and generous with their skills and kindly rememberance can and often does take a material form.  Those who are mercenary, surly and grasping can only realy depend on their customers becoming the same towards them.  And you never know when the next out-of luck fixer that darkens your doorstep looking to have his grid armor constructed for him at a pittance might just run across a PPPE or MMR and think about you.  Personally, I'd rather have said fixer thinking very happy thoughts about me and what I could do for him with that marvellous little toy he just found rather than thinking about the killing he'd make off of selling said toy to the highest bidder.  And yes, it's happened.  It's worth more than all the credits I COULD have been gouging from people along the way.

Just something you might want to think about.

I managed to come across one of these.
Looted it from a chest in a ql130ish mission.
Hope that brightens everyone's day...
