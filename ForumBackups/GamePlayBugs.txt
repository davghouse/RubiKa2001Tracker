Norfolk @ 11/15/2001 7:13:06 PM (Another player appeared in my mission 136):
On the day of the patch i was trying to get into a mission location, playshifting error a few times then finally zoned.  In the entrance room there was another player! he was a confused as I was but as a lower level the mobs were red to him so it must have been my mission.  He left and I went on to complete the mission (return to terminal type) for a reward and token !  Just seems strange, anybody else had this happen?

WGMelchior @ 11/15/2001 7:45:14 PM (136):
Every mission gets a number assigned to it, so I guess there can be mixups. I haven't noticed anything like this yet though.

Annala @ 11/15/2001 7:47:22 PM (Found a Bug.....I think 157):
I've tried this several times since the new patch (v13.0) and it keeps on happening:

I play a level 12 Fixer. When I select a monster within a group of monsters and cast "Passive Distributed Entanglement" but instead of affecting the group of monsters, it affects my character and anyone else arround me.  And usually, if I casted the spell and its a timed spell, I can right click on my NCU stat effects and get rid of it...but with this glitch I cant.

And yes, I've been making sure that the monster is selected and not myself.

Is anyone else having this problem? Or is it just me?

esjay @ 11/15/2001 8:00:36 PM (Confirmed Bugs-That have not been addressed 166):
I've been communicating with the GMs via email, and I just thought I'd post this here:

Loot Bug- Inability to loot a mob when solo or on a team with loot alpha

Instant death- a problem that exists in both missions and the outside world.  You immediately die without appearing to have taken any damage.

Delayed Damage- Your screen fills with red damage spam as you receive all the damage you would have during a successful rooting of a character.  This I have been told is being worked on and ONLY applies to characters that can root.

Trader's "Sticky Ground" Nanoformula is now BROKEN.  Instead of rooting the mobs..it roots the caster and any member of his team.

reggie @ 11/15/2001 8:08:58 PM (Weight limit is going insane 168):
What's up with weight limit? Until 2 days ago I used to carry with me 10 backpacks of stuff and I never before reached the weight limit (dunno if it means anything but I'm a strong atrox with maxed stamina and strength). The last 2 days things have gone havoc. I have put all my stash in the bank, I now carry my basic kits and maybe 1 small backpack of stuff, and even then I'm 21% overburdened. I went on 1 mission and was almost 100% over the limit, just by the loot I picked up in that single mission.

  I also talked to another guy who had the same problem. What's going on ?!

Annala @ 11/15/2001 8:11:22 PM (166):
I've been having the same problems with the Fixer's "Passive Distributed Entanglement." It roots my buddies and I, rather than the monsters.

Ananomous @ 11/15/2001 9:08:29 PM (166):
This type of thing is happening with the NT blinds I'm using.  Blinds me, instead of my tartget.

Ananomous @ 11/15/2001 9:12:09 PM (168):
Weight limits worked in the beginning, but then shut off after one of the early patches.  It appears the limit is working again if this is what's happening to you.  Regardless of the size of the pack you're carrying, you need to look at the weights of each item in it, as well as your inventory.  You should see the indicator on your Stats window as well.

Dumbasbricks @ 11/15/2001 9:18:13 PM (166):
I'll leave my commentaries to the end of this post as to not annoy any players who could care less.

I tested this for most of my playtime yesterday after the patch was implemented. Please let me know if you've ran into similar problems.

1.) Switching out weapons, items and "wear" do not immediately affect your stats or character graphics. Player must zone to see change in both character graphics and stats. ie. weapons and items w/ bonuses such as pillows and rifles etc. "wear" such as armor and clothes with similar stat bonuses.

2.) Nano "Buffs" also do not affect stats immediately. I need to zone for affects to take place.

3.) Targeting yourself while in Yalmaha and hitting "ESC" to untarget results in player dropping out of the sky like a ton of bricks. i.e. I found out the hard way initially and had to swim for shore in Milky Way. (I do not recommend trying this since it took me 10 mins to get to shore since my swimming ability has been untouched since character generation) *PLEASE TEST IN LOW ALTITUDES ONLY!"

4.) Zoning with Yalmaha makes it absolutely useless and must be unequipped and re-equipped to function again.

5.) Player opening a trade window also sends your beautiful plane screaming towards the hard ground. Hasn't happened often and might have other factors attributing to this issue as well. (need to be tested more but I have a lack of volunteers).

***This Portion is Commentary and Opinions ***
***You have been warned!!!***

NERFS:

1.) %100 Nano Cost to Tank Armors render all buffs and nano casting abilities of Soldiers or any one casting with tank armor. This skill is "DEEP BLUE" to soldiers. Making it absolutely impossible to cast a shield or any combat nano's during battle. (it be rather stupid to take off the tank armor, cast, then put the tank armor back on. I tried it already! and it's not recommended). Please consider lowering the cost a bit (which would make more sense) or upgrading the skill muliplier to something more manageable, programming a deep blue skill for soldiers and making the shield nano costs high is a contradiction to the latter.

2.) This is the 3rd time Soldiers took a hit in this nerfing madness. (IMHO). All the while the other character classes have fair'd well. Let us know if you don't want us to play this character and properly remove it from the list of choices.

More to come...

Gritt @ 11/15/2001 9:20:37 PM (Find Item mission bug 209):
I have found that when I get a mission to "find the so and so item and describe it to me and kill everyone inside" that the mission doesn't complete after looking at or picking up the mission objective.  Yes, I did kill all mobs in the mission area.

I tried this on a few missions and I wasn't able to complete any of them.  I discussed this with another player and he said he was having the same problem.  

Has anyone else noticed this? or have you been able to complete a mission of this type sucessfully since the 13.0 patch?

Divedee @ 11/15/2001 9:23:23 PM (209):
Just had the exact same thing happen. I've spent 15 minutes combing every wall for a secret passage to that last monster but it's not there. This is bad; my reward was awesome, and the only reason I took this mission...

Banjosammy @ 11/15/2001 9:24:07 PM (Fighting human NPCs! 211):
Seems to me that human NPCs are twice as hard to fight as before and twice as hard to fight as other MOBs at the same level. What causes this and when could it be fixed? I tried 5 missions now, and I had to give up on all of them, since it's just too hard for my poor adventurer. The human NPCs heal eachother like crazy too...

Taelyn @ 11/15/2001 9:51:05 PM (211):
I tried a mission at 50% (middle of the bar) last night.  Healing myself 3-4 times a battle I barely scraped through the mission until I came to a NPC adventurer.  I'm level 37.  The adventurer did 32 points of damage per hit, with a damage shield that did 15 points of damage.  In addition to this, my QL38 Peasant Executioner and its Fast attack ALWAYS did the minimum 5 points of damage.  My QL 32 Rider Executioner performed far better, averaging a measely 25 points of damage per hit.  To make matters worse, every time the adventurer got down to half hitpoints, he healed up to 2/3.  

To put it simply, MOBs have way, way too high an armor class right now, and fast, light weapons are totally useless against NPCs now.

Another note.  Against mutants, I seem to take an enormous amounts of damage.  Especially the TACs that do chemical damage.  80 points of damage per hit despite a 500 chemical AC.  Ouch!  These facts, combined with the fact that its now impossible to run missions makes the game almost unplayable for my adventurer.

Taelyn @ 11/15/2001 9:55:04 PM (136):
Back about 2 patches ago (I think), I accidently went to the wrong building.  Oddly enough, it allowed me to zone.  I went in and killed everything in the mission, they were all grey.  I found the item at the end, but couldn't complete the mission.  I never saw anyone else at that level, but I suspect this is similar to the oddity you're reporting.

Brigson @ 11/15/2001 10:15:04 PM (209):
I did 2 missions yesterday (after patch) one item find and one 'hive' both worked fine. Today I have tried 2 missions one of each kind and I was unable to complete either whats happening!!

Lucida @ 11/15/2001 10:18:51 PM (209):
I have now had 4 out of 5 missions bugged--I have spend thousands of creds on healing and nano kits --and have spent hours going to out of the way places to find missions that were filled with mostly greys [50% setting] and after killingall of them and getting the item nothing

I had a find the dude mission   NOTHING

I had a kill the dude mission Nothing but got  "you have made a mistake" letter

and 2 find the item missions and NOTHING

I have petitioned and NOTHING  Not even we are sorry and cant help you

Skippy @ 11/15/2001 10:22:17 PM (209):
Same thing happened here.
I gave up on doing any put item on machine missions cause they didnt work. Went back to doing find items, which was fine, now since the patch, I havent received any prizes, sometimes I dont get the item I just picked up to complete, and I dont get the money or experience. That is if you can get through the mission anyway since they made the npcs harder again and obviously didnt learn from the last time they did that.

I hope they fix this quickly cos missions are a waste of space now (major part of game nerfed), the mirrored doors arent fixed like they said and though the compressed graphics are a big improvement, I still cant go through omni without getting so memory leaked that I have to relog.

Funcom, you make great strides, I was at last enjoying the game, but now youve all but nuked its playability. Please acknowledge this and fix it QUICK.

Docmax @ 11/15/2001 10:45:09 PM (missions broken = game stopper 233):
I can't "blitz" missions anymore.  This is the only thing I do when I play.  I can't play with broken missions.  The game has now stopped for me.

To FunCom:  are you planning to fix the missions so that I can run through and get the mission item in "find item" missions?  I would like to know, so that if it isn't I can find another game.

Why do the basic aspects of the game change so often, it's like I have to learn a whole new game every patch; it's very frustrating.

This is a game-stopper issue, as you can tell by the number of theads a posts related to it.

Misophist @ 11/15/2001 10:54:37 PM (233):
Describe item missions are not often working even when the person takes the time to clear out the entire mission for a token. 

Last night, I did three "describe item" missions (where you just grab the item and receive the money and reward then and there), and only two were successful.

I didn't pick the item up as I had before the patch, but simply clicked on it and waited for the mission to complete. Like I said, it worked twice, but the last mission gave no recognition that the item I found was the one to be "described".

I know they aren't working when you're being attacked. Whether this intentional or not, who can tell? I do recall that Funcom said mission blitzing for cash is okay, but you won't get a token that way. Did they change their minds? 

At any rate, for those of us who do kill everything, it's pretty disappointing to get nothing for our efforts.

The settings I've always used are "bad/money", which yield often crappy reward items but offer a decent amount of cash.

Misophist @ 11/15/2001 11:15:05 PM (211):
My now level 47 MA is doing minimum damage against human NPCs, and I know this is the case with all the other MAs I was complaining with in guild chat. 

It really depends on the mob you're fighting. And it definitely depends on their AC. I did a mission with non-human NPCs and it was great. Speedy, not a chore. But when I got to my other mission... well, ugh. The only thing that saved me was Blessed with Thunder, because I was doing even more minimum damage than before the patch.

Before the patch, I'd do min damage against certain orange NPCs, such as soldiers and enforcers.

Now I'm doing minimum damage to those same NPCs, no matter their level. Gray, green, yellow. Sometimes I'll sneak in a 450-560 brawl, but that's rare. And my fight, which goes something along the lines of 45, 45, 45, 47, 48. 50, will be interrupted with a 128. But usually it's just 47, 47, 47, 47, 47, and interrupted by a slightly higher brawl and the Blessed with Thunder energy attacks, that always hit for their minimum damage, too.

A fight with a non-human NPC goes something like this: 200, 100, 200, 150, 70, 99, and that's without BwT and brawl.

Somebody in my guild suggested this might have something to do with the new PvP rules. Only thing is, mobs have so many more HPs than the average player, so that really doesn't make sense.
If the mob were a player, pale orange, and depending on class, I'd probably have an easier time fighting that real human player than his/her pale orange NPC counterpart. Yeah, I'd probably be hitting min damage, but at least it would be more balanced in terms of hitpoints.

Anyway, MAs and other classes who use fists are already the masters of minimum damage -- this has only added to the problem and has caused me to take a serious break from AO.

Misophist @ 11/15/2001 11:22:38 PM (136):
This happened to me a while ago, at least July or August. Was in my mission, running around, and lo and behold, I saw a strange atrox in the main room. I shouted to him, asked him what the hell he was doing there, and he told me he had entered his apartment and found himself in my mission. Weird, huh?

thedude @ 11/15/2001 11:37:59 PM (136):
When I first started playing I ran into a static dungeon in omni-e thinking it was a mission building.  I was quite surprised when other people came in behind me and started killing things in "my mission"!!  Don't know if thats what happened to you or not...

I find the solution to this one is to wait like 45 seconds. Eventually the server will allow you to loot the corpse, just takes a bit of time sometimes.

In all seriousness they will prolly have these things sorted out before the next patch

Veyn @ 11/15/2001 11:59:45 PM (Missions torqued since patch? 251):
I, and MANY people I have talked to, are finding that missions no longer give rewards.  The threads over AOVAULT's boards seem to indicate that half of the people are experiencing this problem, and half are not.  I am one who is.

I play Shelara, a 35th level Clan Adventurer on RK-1.  I chose a mission with the parameters of:  'go to location, look at object, kill all inhabitants and leave'.  In the past I have solved these missions by picking up the item, usually after I kill all the mobs.  Last night after the patch I undertook one of these missions.  Killed all the mobs (which was very difficult since I now mostly only do minimum damage to humans), and then picked up the item.  I got no money, no XP, and no item reward.  I had modified this mission to max BAD and max MONEY.

I spoke to several people at the mission terminals who said they were having the same problem with several different mission types.

Did I miss something in the patch release notes?  Is this some new quirk we're supposed to figure out?  It seems like a bug to me.  Funcom, please advise.

Thanks.

Wolfen @ 11/16/2001 12:03:36 AM (211):
I think it's worse than that. 

I just got out of doing a 50% difficulty mission. Mobs ranged from grey to high orange for a start, with the yellows and oranges paired in large rooms, so no certainty of a token and some damn hard fights even before this patch.

After managing to single pull a few yellows and 2 oranges, and having the fights of my life I noticed something. 

ALL the mobs were regenerating, even the greens and greys (not that it saved them), the higher level mobs were regenerating fast enough that I reckon they had to take 150% of their normal HP to kill, and then some of them healed 5-6 times on top of that. 

I killed all I could, some of the oranges and yellows (especially adventurers) took so long to kill I had to refresh my own HoT and finished some fights long after it had run out again (yes folks, yellow mobs that take 10 minutes to kill), but I was finally balked on the last two rooms, paired high orange scouts.

I desperately hope this is a bug, or else I'm going to be unable to complete missions that have anything above a low yellow healing mob.

Hi, I did my first mission today because AO said they were fixed, I finally found one that wasnt miles away again, got there cleared the dungeon first so I could have a chance of a token. 

All i had left to do was observe a bird, well I observed it for about 10 mins and nothing happened, so I tried to leave the dungeon and come back in again, it crashed.

logged in again, observed the bird again, still nothing so I just killed it. waste of time.

While i was doing this I was talking to a friend and his mission would'nt complete either.

So please can somebody look into this.

I've also crashed out of the game 3 times since the last patch, its never happend to me before.

Scorus @ 11/16/2001 1:08:51 AM (Monster targeting in missions 266):
Monsters are much harder to target in missions since 13.0. I used to be able to get myself to where I could see them through an open door and tab to target them, then I send in the pet and wait until they get low enough so that they wouldn't aggro on me when I do my damage. Now I can't target unless I walk into the room, at which point they are on me for the duration. This makes it even more difficult for pet users.

Was this an effect of the 'fix' that prevented players and monsters from shooting through doors? Was it intended?

Kohistan @ 11/16/2001 1:37:32 AM (Find Item missions bugged ARGH!!!! (need fix NOW) 272):
This patch is prolly one of the worst patches concerning bugs yet (Besides 12.6 offcourse).

Mission: (Find item and click on it)

Mission #1 The first I took after the patch worked fine, I dunno what I did right (wrong) in that mission but I got my money and reward for it just by clicking on the item I should find.

Mission #2 A blitz mission - Or at least I thought I could blitz it but that was nerfed. So now we have to spend intire hours to kill everything in the mission berfore getting the reward - And the brings me to...

Mission #3 Were I killed a lot of the mobs - Left some dark nasty Oranges out and -whent down were I first found the Item and clicked on it.. NO reward, NO money, NO token, NO xp....

Mission #4 This one I made just a bit easier so I could kill everything inside. I run around in the mission killing mobs (getting soooo borred). I find the Item . But I know I havent found all mobs yet - SO I run around killing the rest of the mobs (kill, shoot, kill, shoot kill...)Estimated Time for mission 2 hours ! - Used for about 4000 creds of heal (treatment and first aid).

I go back to the Item and click on it again Knowing that nothing except a Frightened Rollerrat (wich cat be killed) is alive. 

.....Click on item... wait... wait.. Click on me.. click on item.. wait.. - After 5 mins of having the item highlighted and nothing happening, I decide to try taking it up to see if they have changed that, so I put it in my inventory and wait.. N-o-t-h-i-n-g!

So this mission has cost me 4000 creds of heal. 1000-2000 bullets, Im STILL short the 25k and the tank armor this mission was rewarding...

---------------------------------

Can we please.. have a responds to this - Im am very very close to delete AO and have a better and less frustrating life with something other than this.

I know that 25k and a tank armor isnt all that much. But I have Shot my way through hords of nano-casters, Rookie soldiers and enforcer to get this. I will NOT let people make me look like a fool by wasting mine and other peoples time by taking money from them and giving them a poor product in return.. this is NOT my idea of fun - I love AO, and have done it since I started playing it - But It seems like Funcom is persistent in ruining my fun. Any other game with this kind of bug-horror in it would have been terminated a long time ago. But since that AO has its moments I try and try and try to give it another change again and again... 
But come on - How much do u really think that Us gamers will tolerate, How much do u really think that u can push this before we draw the line - and say no more.. 
I am really Pissed at the moment, because I feel that Patches atm gives us small features.. (guild features is medium) but its nothing compared to the bugs that gets to the live servers.

Wasting 2 hours of really really borring Hack n' slash to get nothing in return is NOT my idea of fun.

Yeah, I heard a soldier was hitting for about 2 on a regular basis. A level 70 soldier. Well, when I snuck in a Bird of Prey (fights are taking so long that I can wait for my Blessed with Thunder to cycle and throw in another attack like Bird of Prey), it hit for around 27. Hehe. Sigh!

Feetus @ 11/16/2001 1:48:16 AM (272):
Yep - that sounds about right. I usually do the missions where you are supposed to observe some person. After the new patch, I was able to do my first mission...but after that...no more. The first mission went fine other than the fact that the mission wouldn't complete while I was fighting the person I should have been watching. I ended up having to run out of the mission area before I killed him, turned into a leet, went sneaking back in and watched him and got my money and reward. My next two missions, however, did not work. I tried everything I could think of...I even went sneaking in as a leet, sat down watching the person, logged out, logged back in - looked at the mission boss - sat there on the ground for like 10 minutes staring at him and got nothing.

The good thing is that I should still be able to do the missions where you have to kill the mission boss...or so I hear. I can do that cause that's what I always end up doing anyways...but I think I would prefer being able to do any type of mission since I usually tend to do the mission based on the reward and not based on how the mission is to be completed.

Funcom...please fix this as soon as you can. And after that...take a look at my other reply post about how cloaking devices need to be made more useful and cars and clan/omni applications need to be tradeable items (not NODROP).

Thanks for the fun time anyways! =)

Kohistan @ 11/16/2001 1:50:00 AM (211):
Yes human NPC's are So hard to kill now. I noticed it just after patch was released but as allways u cant count on mausser because they have so wide dmg range - But after awhile I could really see something was wrong - One time I wrote all dmg down from my side.

On a Green Rookie soldier my QL 100 mausser did this dmg:

31, 20, 396 (burst), 33, 74, 149, 40, 56, 76, 151, 43, 91, 65, 71, 377 (crit), 83, 13, 161, 59, 86, 235 (burst), 49, 133 - That gives me an average shot (Not counting the times were I didnt hit at all, and not counting burst): 88 dmg from a Ql 100 weapon ?! - Come on.. tell me I didnt waste about a 100k on this weapon (buy weapon, new implants, skill wrangle) for an average shot on 88 ...

Noe @ 11/16/2001 1:57:51 AM (233):
i assumed that "get item" or ALL BAD, ALL MONEY missions were ok in test and in live post 13.0 because a did a few.

I did two today, and they were broken.

these are the kind where the item is in the dungeon and all you have to do is retrieve it.

I usually only have to click on the object, or pick it up (either or) and i get the appropriate reward, xp, money or token depending upon the conditions i have fulfilled.

Today i did two in Clon****. Neither worked.  One was a "small" mission, the other "large."  I killed all mobs.

This mission type has NEVER been broken in the past.  This is the first time Ive seen it broken (sigh) and is my favorite type, as you get to keep the item, the reward, token and money.

Two possible causes:

When obtaining this mission, i was saved in Tir and got the mission in Borealis at the booth across from the whompa.  When picking ALL BAD, ALL MONEY, it yeilds only two missions.

also, you cannot "sell" or trade items for the "backpacks", I got the message "you cannot trade this from your backpack...(yet)"
a tangential problem, but perhaps there is new code with respect to items in your inventory, and perhaps that is part of the problem.

I've been having the same problems with the Fixer's "Passive Distributed Entanglement." It roots my buddies and I, rather than the monsters.
			
		
	
Yep, same here.

Other bugs:

- teammate's damage/health doesn't always update on your screen.  We were fighting a mob, and from my screen, it looked like he was just standing there facing the mob.  Neither of them seemed to be doing/taking any damage (except for damage shields!).  On my teammate's screen, though, he was dishing it out and taking lots of damage, and in fact was almost dead.

As a side note, the critter's hitpoints showed up very different on our two screens as well.


- "hall of mirrors" effect in mission doorways still occurring.

Obitus @ 11/16/2001 2:15:22 AM (Dual wield problems 278):
My off-hand weapon keeps coming off every time I zone.  Is this going to be fixed??

Karmantra @ 11/16/2001 2:35:09 AM (My little list of problems from 13.0 284):
Well, I'm sure that everyone has heard about the mission problems already, but I have a couple of issues that I haven't seen discussed yet to add, as well as my own mission complaints too.

1. As far as missions go, I can say that out of the five missions I took last night I was only able to complete two of them. The two types of missions that seemed to work were "Assasinate" missions and "return the item" ones. I still had problems with the ones where you need to "repair" something, and all the ones where I was supposed to "observe" someone or something did not give me any rewards. 

2. The missions do seem to be slightly more difficult now, and the human NPCs do seem to take lower damage than the ones I was fighting outside missions. The main problem my MA seemed to have was getting resists and lower dmg, while the monsters were chain healing and hitting for max alot. 

3. The new code to save window positions or maybe the new "optional" graphic enhancement seems to have done something to wearable clothes, and equiping them from inside a backpack. It is no longer possible to put clothes directly on from inside the backpacks, and instead the clothing items need to be in your main inventory to equip them.  The new option to save positions is a nice feature, but, I would rather have had the backpack stop re-sorting items on it's own or had things loot directly into the backpack instead. Also, the "optional" thing was supposed to make graphics load quicker, but changing armor does not load any quicker and still shows the ugly default armor in between swapping items (but it did improve the framerate a slight degree).

4. The changes made to emotes are also really troubling me. The new animation female characters get for /itch is just plain ugly/disturbing looking. This animation makes my characters look all distorted in the shoulders and neck, and it seems to me that this animation would be more suited to male characters than female ones. I'm not really sure why the names of the emotes needed to change, but either way I'd like to have the old animation back instead of having this garish, unnatural looking one.

Well, that's all I've been able to find so far, but if I find any more I'll be sure to include them (and I hope others do as well).

I still enjoy the game and think it has a lot of promise, but it's obvious there's still lots of work left for Funcom on some things.

Noe @ 11/16/2001 3:12:14 AM (NT is fumbling MUCH more now 294):
I am finding i am fumbling MUCH more now, and can be potentially deadly if fighting an orange, dark orange mob.

Previously i would get a fumble about once every 5-20 mobs, usually on the more difficult casts (Energy Projectile; my MC = 284, cast req is 258)  I use this fast high/variable damage mob the most once in battle and use Feet of Stone/E.P./FoS/E.P/FoS/E.P. until it is dead.

I now have fumbles at least ONCE per fight!

This I HOPE, is NOT as it is intended!

Please, have a dev comment!

I will cross post this on the NT board.

thanks.

Garzu @ 11/16/2001 3:46:41 AM (The capped nano range is a game stopper!!! 302):
Yeah, i wonder what FC is going to do with NTs and other profs dependant on range. This is a game stopper because many is considering stopping (quitting) the game becuase of the range nerf

We are the single most defenseless profession in the game, we dont have any pets to take the hits for us, we dont have any decent hp or ac buffs, we dont have any form of shield that can reflect the damage. 

Where does this leave us? It leaves us with the most uber gimped profession in all online games ever. Only thing i can do now is to team with others, i still do ok dmg but without healer and others to help kill opponents i cant do anything at all. I still get all the aggro even now that i always have the slider on max def, the doc automatically targets me for healing, no need for team heals when an NT is in the team (good thing for the Doc i guess). 

I dont understand why you capped our range at 40m, why not 80m which is max view distance. And i think it should be the same in pvp as pvm, we had an advantage if we were out of range from ranged and melee weapons, but we had a disadvantage if we were inside range, i honestly dont see the balancing problem here.

SecretAgentMan @ 11/16/2001 4:37:58 AM (Fix the Grid Defense Comp Mission Are Broke, Too 314):
I successfully finished a 'Fix the Defense Grid Computer' mission, the computer disappeared, the mission icon disappeared from my mission menu and the mission key went poof, too.

I never got the music to let me know the mission completed, I never received the reward item (Phantom Weight nano crystal for my friend who helped me complete the mission) nor the money or experience.

Coupled with the numerous reports of Item-Watching missions not working, it makes me wonder what mission types actually do work (did an assasination mission, it does work)... :-(

SecretAgentMan @ 11/16/2001 4:41:13 AM (OT Basic Weaponsdealer in Clon**** outpost has no inventory 315):
Not sure if this is a new bug or not, as I can't remember ever using this vendor before, but I know it's the first time I've ever seen a vendor with no inventory.

This vendor is located next to the big round tent, right by the insurance terminal and bank.

Valeriya @ 11/16/2001 5:11:06 AM (Nanokits, and Treatment clinics: Bug. 318):
Hi.

Status: Reproducable

If I am involved in any combat situation that is very laggy (cyborg camp), etc, more than 20 participiants.    If I attempt to sit down and use a treament kit, and I lag.  I am rewarded with "Unable to use item, please check description."  

It doesn't matter what I do to correct.  Zoning will fix, as will dropping the item, and picking it up again.

Please fix!

And start seling stuffed plushie leets so I can relieve my hostility in a non-threatening manner!

bac @ 11/16/2001 5:21:38 AM (318):
noticed a similar thing last night, the cause for me was not lag but was well this is what I did after a fight...

F1 to target myself, sat down and while I was sitting I ID'd a weapon just looted, so at this stage I was still highlighted but I also had info on teh weapon (normal stuff nothing new about that) anyhoo when I did use the treatment kit I got that error "unable to use blah blah" which was wrong as I was still targetted.. so the game thought I was trying to heal the weapon no doubt, anyhoo I pressed escape and then F1 again and away I went... 

this may help dunno, worth a try atleast.

cson @ 11/16/2001 5:51:12 AM (Everything's broken 322):
Missions are broken. I just did three describe item missions. I was not in a fight when I picked up the item. Nothing happened. But when I zone out, the mission disappears, but I get no item reward. I don't understand. why can't I complete missions. Nothing works in this game. Nothing. Can't you guys do anything right. Anything?

Skep @ 11/16/2001 6:02:58 AM (Two hits in a row?! Absured!!! 325):
this something that has been bugging me since i bought AO a few weeks ago:

i am a lvl 17 soldier. never, and i mean NEVER have i hit a mob or other player two times in a row. well this is not technically correct as i HAVE hit the enemy but it does no damage. and i know i hit them because my gun makes a big green flash when i hit my target. so if i attack someone, my first hit does damage but my second, whether it hits the enemy or not, does no damage. then my third will do damage only if i hit the enemy. if i miss, the next time i hit the enemy it will do damge and skip the time after that. similarly odd, special attacks NEVER miss. whether or not i hit or miss the enemy, my special attacks always do damage.

in the first case, it seems that the "no two hits in a row" affects mosters too. in the second case, if a monster misses me on a special attack it does no damage. now believe me i dont mind an edge over my opponent but thats not fair. i just wanted to know how aware people are of this and if it was on the agenda to by fixed in a future patch.

reggie @ 11/16/2001 6:18:12 AM (266):
I always had that problem. You see through an open door (usually w/ some distortion) and directly at a bully walking around in the next room, still you can't target him with the mouse and he doesn't appear on the TAB until you walk in there and become attacked.

reggie @ 11/16/2001 6:21:46 AM (168):
Well that is completely laughable. IMHO

spitoon @ 11/16/2001 6:37:45 AM (272):
Well now you've done it. We can't even run missions now.

I ran the whole mission clicked on the target (my inventory accepted it) but no cash or reward.

I just don't understand how you can consistently screw up more and more stuff. I am not going to rant but geez leave it on the test sever and fix this stuff before we waste our time playing badly conceived and executed patches.

Leave a message on the bulletin board and when this stuff is fixed – maybe I can clear some more time to play when it means advancement of my toon.

Thank for your time.

Reducks @ 11/16/2001 7:15:12 AM (325):
This is one of those times in an RPG where you have to put on your Imagination Hat... I'm pretty sure the extra shots are there in the animations just to look cool. 

If not, then each damage report you get is the sum of all the damage you did in your last 2-3 hits.

Get what I'm saying?

Takima @ 11/16/2001 7:30:12 AM (Official ETA on mission fix? 335):
I'd just like to know if Funcom is away of this problem, and if they have an idea of when it's going to be fixed. I've already filled out bug reports and sent them, and I feel there's no need to repeat the problems here. Just look around at the other dozen or so threads on this matter.  I've tried all the 'fixes' that players have done to no avail. I can't get one to work.  I would have thought this would be a major priority to Funcom as missions are a big part of the game (and much hyped), and I would expect a fix before the weekend from a competent company.

P.S. Sorry about the multiple threads, but I have no idea where to put this on the new board, as there is no 'general' section. IMHO the new board has way to many different sections.

P.S.S. When is Beta testing going to end?

Well, when I'm actually allowed to cast charm on a monster, and assuming it's not resisted, the monster doesn't listen to me.  It won't attack, it won't guard, though it will follow and agro me when charm breaks.  I've had charm break more then once within 2 or 3 seconds.  

This was reported as a bug in 12.9

We were told it was reproducable and the dev team would work on a fix for it.

Here is 13.0.

It's still not fixed.

Once again, crats get nerfed, new crat bugs are introduced, and the bugs aren't fixed before you nerf us again.

By now anyone who has tried to create an Emergency Treatment kit or First Aid kit has realized that they only come with one charge. I sure that the Treatment kits are atleast sopos to come with 75 charges. If this is a bugg I hope it is resolved ASAP.

Beartwo @ 11/16/2001 8:57:25 AM (211):
This has definately put a new dimension on things.... On top of the missions not owrking its now so hard to kill the mobs that I no longer want to try doing a 50% mission. I am a lvl69 soldier whom teammates usually could rely on to do a decent amount of damage... or perhaps save the doc on hunts (especially important now that doc`s seem to aggro everything). I am getting 2 dmg hits from a ql90 Nova and a ql102 XM. I have spent close to 700.000k on implants and weapons...(and god knows how much time). my average hits on the nova are about 45 and the xm (when the reload bug doesnt stop me firing, or take it easy.....or waiting for previous special attack...) does  about 100dmg on avg. 
13.0 did some nice thngs with the gphx, but definately did nothing for PvM. You have managed to take almost all of the fun out of the game Funcom.... with the tech difficulties in 13.0 you now risk loosing a lot of players who thought the game was getting good with 12.9.

Before anyone starts ranting about the fact that I havent given any new info to the programmers, I`d like to say that all of this is something they should have tested and found out on the test server.... there are simply too many errors in everyday normal tasks that they could have missed them.

Hanamichi @ 11/16/2001 9:18:44 AM (265):
I've experienced this as well and it is a recent change as before you could simply exit any pools of water by walking up the incline.  Now you have to stop moving, jump straight up and at the peak of your jump move forward to exit the water.  Also, my attempts to jump over such pools of water are strange as well as I don't get nearly as much height in my leap over pools in missions as I do on solid ground - I seem to hit an invisible ceiling or whatnot and fall down into the drink.  Not really game-stopping but still a very noticeable bug or change in the physics of the game.

Sarumon @ 11/16/2001 10:12:34 AM (233):
Hi
I made 5-6 Find Item missions after the 13.0 patch, and they worked fine.
But after the message that they had “fixed” the server crashes nothing work.
Yesterday I made 4 Find Items and 2 Find Person missions and they all failed.
 I have made hundreds of these missions before without failing, so something is definitively broken here.
At all times the Items or Person was there, but it was “dead” and didn’t trigger mission success.
Anyone have a tip on mission types that still woks?

Nevander @ 11/16/2001 10:15:59 AM (233):
Decryption-missions work fine (the ones were you head off to a "dungeon" and look for a terminal, icon contains a yellow cogwheel).

I'd also like to note that the MOTD in the launcher says that the missions are in the process of getting fixed. IE, not with the next patch but asap. As I remember it, it's already on the test server. Any word from there?

Drifyt @ 11/16/2001 10:33:50 AM (A call to arms people 357):
Hi Funcom,

Some of us love this game.....really.

I have started this thread to intitate an emergency patch, yes they do happen in other games when things are wrong and they admit they made a mistake. Theres just no communication on these boards so we don't have a clue whats going on behind the scenes.

 Some of us just dont want to wait two weeks till it is all sorted out. So please

1. Release a patch immediately fixing all our problems or if you can't do that just yet

2. Reinstate 12.9 

I'm sure if you reverted back a lot of people wouldn't mind the patch time to go to a more stable version. I for one wouldn't I can't play in the games current state

Reinstate 12.9 until you fixed 13.0 PLEASE

Whos with me?

Obitus @ 11/16/2001 10:38:45 AM (211):
I have always noticed that I hit Human or Cyborg NPCs for significantly less damage than animals.  In a fight against an animal I might do 300-700 damage per hit while against a human of the same lvl, I might do 100-300 per hit.

In teaming with a group doing lvl 160-180 missions, I don't notice that the doc gets aggrod more than the rest of us.  They do aggro him eventually but that is only because his DOT is hitting well.  I am lvl 105 atm and the test of the team is lvl 125-137.  We have one doc and 3-4 MAs and me.We seem to be able to handle the missions very well up to about lvl 180, after that, there are too many masters and vets and you get adds like crazy.

Consider doing group misions, it is a good way to still get money because you can do a mission alot higher than your level and you will also get good xp killing the MOBs.

Stabdude @ 11/16/2001 11:18:22 AM (233):
I almost always see only posts in here that are only related to game mechanics, nothing that has to do with TECHNICAL (i.e. crash, sound/gfx problems, zoning) issues. Why can't you people just please atleast *try* to use the proper forums for things? 

Please don't make this become another "General" forum of the old....

Noe @ 11/16/2001 11:28:47 AM (233):
ok, so i dont really like these kind cuz in the past they DIDN'T work, i just tested one, and i cleared a large mission playfield, the yellowish rocky kind w/ the pool in the middle of the center area, killed all mobs, no NPC humanoid (yea!) and then went back to the room w/ the Flame Slapon thingee.

I got the reward, token, money

XtroXtreme @ 11/16/2001 11:48:40 AM (211):
heh, and I though the mobs just got rediculus powerful once more. 

Well I guess that explains my problems as well. Good thing I have good implants and armor, or I would probably have the same problem as that agent I helped out with a mission yesterday.

Guadoc @ 11/16/2001 12:41:44 PM (209):
Me too. Happened to have an ARK in the mission with me (looking at guild problems) and he said that as far as he could see it should be completable (it was a describe it to me mission).


However, I picked it up (no joy), dropped it again and observed it about 20 times (didn't work), left the mission and came back in on ARK's suggestion (didn't work). I tried for about 1/2hr as I needed the $$s but couldn't get it to finish.

Bit of a pain after a long run to get to the mission...

But this bug is really a gamestopper indeed.
it soo silly the players have to come up with workarounds for "fixes". It is taking its toll on the meaningfullness of continued play of the game.

If the todays fix aint fixes things AO is a bye bye for me. There comes a time when you have to make choice, I am at that line now. Another fukkup by UnFuncom and I pushed over that line = cancel account.

I just spent the last 10 minutes running away from my "live with" target (trying to avoid getting killed), and no, it doesn't work.

I tried zoning out and coming back in and staring at him.  But his aggro range is so large, I can't target him w/o getting into a fight.

After lots of running, no, it doesn't work.

Do any of the missions work at all?  Reports from other players in Omni Trade shopping channel says no.

"Sorry about the multiple threads, but I have no idea where to put this on the new board, as there is no 'general' section."

Well, I would suggest that "Game-stopper Issues" mean you cannot get the game to run at all.  Due to installation problems, the client crashing, inability to log in, lost characters, etc.  Read this forums description.

So, I think that your post would have been more suited to the "Other Technical Issues" forum.

Sumonia @ 11/16/2001 3:02:12 PM (MA Bug 404):
Loads of mobs in mission you cannot hit for more than a set amount of dmg, which is about 100 pts a hit lower than i can do. 

Its like the mobs (all green) have 1000000 more ac than they are meant to. It means im strugglin against puny green mobs... 

Im lv 54, fully implanted with lv 70s, full buffed to the eyeballs and all i can hit for is 55 EVERY SINGLE HIT !!!!!!!!! 

Any idea when you think its gonna be fixed ?

Aren't you happy with this bugfix ? lol

WGMelchior @ 11/16/2001 3:37:38 PM (404):
This is mainly due to the fact that all MA attacks uses Melee/MA as damage, and we all know that is the worst kind. This coupled with the fact that MA has a small damage range means that you don't need much AC to bring it down to minimum damage.

This is not a bug. It's a design flaw. Everything is technically working as it should.

Kinkstaah @ 11/16/2001 3:54:38 PM (Exiting Vehicle Visual bugs 416):
The following things happen when you exit a vehicle.

1) You are the default "Scale" - Bracers, Initial "Tall/Short" height is not taken into account, various buffs do not have effect.
2) Your armor reverts to "Default" colour. If it is a different colour, such as the blue Plasteel, or ritan, or vitos etc, upon leaving a plane it will look like Heated plasteel (Red)
This also happens with the Cyber armors, the Tech armors, and the Energized armors. Essentially any armor where variations of it are different "colours"
3) Heads disappear when you exit planes/cars/any vehicle with sunglasses on.
4) Trenchcoats of any type display incorrectly. What happens is the trenchcoat texture is wrapped around the player default model, not the trenchcoat model.

ALL of the above bugs happen at once if a player exits a vehicle. It's minor, it can be solved by reequipping everything, but it's annoying nonetheless, and should be minor to fix?

Maybe?
Okay I admit it, I am a slave to fashion.

No kidding... I thought this was only on Test... Sheesh.  Last night, I went through *12* Full Autos against a green adv. type mob, and never did more than 16 points of damage on any normal shot.  This is with a lvl 37 soldier, maxed attacks, QL50 assault rifle (Can't remember the type, but it's got a really great crit for a projectile weapon) against a green mob that showed POD as being only 2 ticks away from grey.  pretty idiotic... And then I can take out orange probes with little trouble.  Shouldn't that be the other way around?  I mean, probes are made of metal... *shrug*  I don't understand funcom.  Neocron should be out soon... if they don't decide that it's not ready to leave beta again. (They seem to have taken funcom's foul-ups to heart.

1)Missions: Since 13.0 this is totally broken. You can divide it in some subproblems
 a) missions not completing. Means no reward, means lost    time, means game stopper
b) mission reward, if you even get it. At lvl 71 i am now getting missions in newland, aegan, varmint woods giving maximum 30K as credits, plus the item. Now lets see, my nanos cost aproximatly 300k/nano, then i have to buy armor, nanokits, treatment labs, ...... . As you can see i will have to do a LOT of missions (each taking 30min-2hours soloing).

2)Tradeskills: Only for some professions and even then tedious, not rewarding. You only get limited experience, so you have to make a lot to level, and dont expect to get alot of money from this thing

3) Hunting: This comes down to finding a spot, settle in, hope it has a decent respawn rate, and then you start pressing buttons. Very boring. Only rewarding experience wise. Problem: you level but get behind in equipment which means you will get worse at killing which will eventualy lead to not be able to kill greens. So you will have to get money but oops, WHERE?

4) Story: Not much story experienced here. Lets see we have 2 episodes, they are pretty cool i think. But implemented in game?
each episode has a dungeon with it. Now lets see at those dungeons. The mobs in them are HIGHLY stronger then the supposed level, meaning the hitpoints they have. They can take alot of damage, for example the pumpkinheads, my lvl 71 metaphycist took like 5-10 min to take down a grey pumpkinhead, burning through 6 nanokit charges in the progress.
Event wise, I have seen 0 events, being europian, the events take place at 4 am or something like that.


5) Then we have the general bugs, exploits, crashes, performance loss, lag, etc


Now try to explain to me, where the hell are we supposed to find the fun in this game?

newshadow @ 11/16/2001 5:41:53 PM (Respawing in BFE 467):
I've created a a new char who is a lvl 11 fixer. I'm a glutton for punishment, I know, but I was getting bored with my soldier. Anyway, I was running a mission in Athen Shire and I died trying to get there, no biggie, been happening all night. My problem is, I respawned in a place called 4 Waterfalls. It's in a playfield near Broken Shores. I'm in a 100% supression field, but it is surrouned by 25% zones and is populated by red aggros like Anuns and Vulture squablers. 

How do I get out of this situation? Thank you for your help.

Since Patch 13.0 I can't intitiate combat. The system keeps telling me to 'TAKE IT EASY' !!

Please tell it to stop doing this !!!

I want to kill things !! eekk.. I need to whack things brutallly in the head till they fall over in a crumpled heap and then be  offered the chance to loot them for some poxy monster part or other.

Why can't I kill stuff ???!!!!!

No one is forcing you to play. If you don't like it and can't stand to wait until they finish ironing out these little bugs, then leave.

Just tried it on test, and it worked.
Went to live after being told they had patched it, and twice it has failed.

Any ETA on a total fix?

Scorus @ 11/16/2001 6:04:11 PM (462):
Actually you can forget hunting after 13.0 also, the "Take it easy" bug is far worse now. For those of you that weren't around, that was a bug introduced in 12.6 as a fix for an exploit where players would keep hitting Q with some weapons and negate their weapon recharge time. Unfortunately it popped up in a lot of other situations. It was mostly fixed in 12.7, whose sole purpose was to fix the MANY bugs introduced by 12.6. But it was was never completely fixed and is much worse after 13.0.

Greetings,

I play a trader and found out that my new nifty 300hp team heal stops others from casting nanos.  I regulary team with an nt and she cant cast when im healing, found this out when fighting a particulary tough mob.  Can we fix the team heal nanos please so other classes can still cast.  Docs team heals I have found do the same thing - I can not cast if I am recieving a team heal.  Otherwise give us an option to turn off team nanos.

Anyone else have thoughts on this?

Girltoy @ 11/16/2001 6:26:31 PM (Buggy Containers 491):
If I have a container(backpack) just in my inventory and inside the container is an item(helmet, hood, weapon) and if I RIGHT click on that item it used to go directly onto the character and whatever it replaced came into the backpack and in the case of weapons/clothing/armor the character will be updated so that she is wearing the item.

Since the patch(13.0) the item 'seems' to go on to the character but the avatar is NOT updated. I have to zone for this update.

Oh and last night AO crashed when I did this. After I relogged the item that should have gone into the backpack was no where to be found. I lost my newbie shield this way.

I don't understand how this bug got through the Quality Control team? And did FC say items should not move around in your backpack/inventory everytime you zone? Hello? It STILL happens to me. I organize my backpack the way I want it and after I zone, I look inside to see tons of empty spots on top and all of my items are way at the bottom. And if it's full, although I see all the empty spots it says I can't put anything else in. 

This is so silly. I mean, how hard is it to set an array and assign items to each array? I know that all C++ people love to use pointers but in this case pointers do not seem to work very well. Go open a fortran book and learn how to use arrays and redo the inventory control please. 

Or fix the gui of inventory to that of Diablo. I'd rather see something like that than having to scroll down 25 empty boxes (which are NOT empty) to get to my items.

Also, regarding generic box things with question marks whenever you put an item down. How hard is it to make an 'icon' for each type of an item? I mean, at least make just ONE icon PER type of an item so we can SEE what the heck it is! This I swear would probably take 1 day for 1 person to do. ONE icon for a gun, sword, armor, clothing, etc. They don't even have to have a high polygon count. 

But I digress...

Maybe you should take it easy! 

Actually I found that you may need to either:

 Scan and /terminate Re-equip everything or just re-equip without /term

Poweredge|vault @ 11/16/2001 6:28:19 PM (211):
Usually I team up with a group of friends and do 100% red missions who are all about L65-80. The missions are usually about L125+

We do these missions as a challenge, but now it's getting silly.

We enter the building and hit a mob hard. Usually I'll pull and TRS 3 up for 31 seconds (TRS 2 now tho - see tank nano). This buys us enough time to get in some heavy damage, and we'll normally steal about 5k-6k HP from the mob before if we have to bail.

So when we run outside, we heal up. Spend perhaps 10 to 20 seconds getting ourselves back in order and head back in. Human NPC's will have regenerated around 2.5k HP back in 20 seconds.

If we have someone die in the mission, then you can kiss that 5k damage goodbye completely. We've actually stood in the entrance and watched how fast they regen HP.

Now some may say "but they are L125+ mobs", but be serious.

Medium size bags seem to have an issue too.

I died last night and went to the reclaim terminal, only to find that not only was my equipment there, but 3 bags from my bank box.

I took them to the bank and they had gone.

The funniest part is trying to get medium bags in and out of reclaim terminals or the bank. You can spend hours playing a whole new sub-game.

Mustafo @ 11/16/2001 6:43:12 PM (325):
I think this is a small bug where the client and server really aren't  in sync.  The first is a false animation and the second is the actual shot(or vice versa).  Watch the attack bar,  you should get one actual attack every time the bar goes right and then have to wait the recharge time.  You see two shots but only one is registered to the server.

Sort of annoying but at least it doesn't affect

Tarrak @ 11/16/2001 6:45:05 PM (Team Grid phreak broken by patch 13.0 499):
My most important nano "team grid phreak" which worked flawlessly before 13.0. now says" not enough nano energy".
It requires 801, and i have 860. What gives?

* and NO, I'm not wearing tank armor.

Misophist @ 11/16/2001 6:51:20 PM (211):
Why did I spend money on crazy high QL implants if I'm hitting min damage all the time and barely surviving fights? Okay, okay, I'm talking about fights against light orange mobs, but after this patch, I'm doing min even to green and grey mobs of the soldier or enforcer variety. I win those those fights easily, but man, before it took about a second to dispatch a gray mob in a mission. Now it might take a good deal longer if it's a high AC profession. 

Grays -- no experience. Shouldn't take more than a few seconds to kill. And they should NOT be appearing in 50% missions, nor should oranges. Greens, okay, they should be pretty easy. I shouldn't be hitting them for minimum damage. 

I seem to do a little better against adventurers, but if the AC or damage shield is too good, I hit for min with my fists. And what gets me is it's not just MAs anymore. The only person I know who isn't complaining is an engineer, whose bot is NOT hitting for minimum damage. So lucky him. He doesn't have to tank and his bot still kicks ass, though he does admit that his pet seems to be attacking with less speed.

I think this is a big problem. Not because I shirk challenges, but because it's just way too time consuming and I use a TON of treatment kits/nano rechargers (well, that's not a big deal, but I often run out during the course of a mission -- 50-100 nano/health kits?!?). And I often have to flee from the mission, whereas that was VERY rare before 13.0.

Well, I'm happy they're fixing location and the broken item/describe missions today. At least I hope they are successful.  

But the things that should be addressed, so I don't have to start yet another newbie because my MA isn't much fun anymore, are as follows:

- Please take a look at MOB AC and any other factors that would possibly affect damage output PvM. 

- Please fix it so that we get only green mobs for average (50%) missions. If I could count on NOT getting these pale orange mobs that I can barely handle post 13.0, then it wouldn't be so bad. I don't know if this will be addressed in today's server-side patch, but I do think it's an important issue nonetheless.

- Study the way mobs are regaining their hitpoints. WE, the human players, don't gain our hitpoints back so quickly. Hardly fair to give us mobs that we can barely solo and have to leave the mission numerous times to kill, only to find they've nearly healed up in the time it took for us to recharge with nano/health kits.

Well, that's all. At least for this topic.

Hossley @ 11/16/2001 7:08:36 PM (499):
Tarrak,

It might also be that annoying bug where you actually have less nano than is shown in your stats (the client and server out of sync I believe), though to be honest if it's 80 nanopoints out that would be the biggest I've seen.

You can see this one all the time when you try to cast when you're right on the money with your nanopool (eg in the middle of a fight and slowly recharging your nano and desperately need to cast that HoT). It's usually fatal, like so many other bugs in the game  

It's the same kind of thing you see with Nanoprogs wearing off before they say they should in the display, and when you get "Treatment Skill Available" and it still won't let you use a Treatment kit for 2 or 3 seconds...

blu789 @ 11/16/2001 7:13:07 PM (Yalmaha / playfield annoyances / bugs 503):
Thanks for fixing falling damage.  Unfortunately, Yalmaha has problems still:

1. Zoning drops it back into your inventory.  Why is this a problem?

Because some Funcom designer thought it was a brilliant idea to put a zone wall in the *middle* of a huge lake.

You zone with your Yalmaha, you fall into the lake on the other side.  If you equip your Yalmaha while swimming, you do NOT fly.  You SWIM.

Most of the time enhanced sharks kill me, especially since you can't fight back while swimming either.

2. If you equip your Yalmaha while swimming, no, you don't fly.  You have to find dry land, unequip it, and reequip it.

3. Why are so many zone boundaries surrounded by huge lakes?  It makes this problem so much more annoying.  So because of this "artificial" magic wall, you can't use your plane because the water traps are death.

Krystka @ 11/16/2001 7:17:23 PM (Missions still having a few issues. 504):
I worked on running to ever terminal I could think of to try and get missions including:  Omni - Ent, Omni - Trade,  Lush Fields,  Harry's,  20k outpost,  Clon****,  Galway Castle,  Newland, Borealis, and even the Omni outpost in Avalon (Omni Tek Base).   The locations I received were much more of an imporvement from before.    

Two things which I noticed:
Two locations still do not show up which did before:  Vermint Woods, and Aegean.   From any of those terminals listed above.

I did a describe item mission in Stret East bank near the Trinity face caves.   Got the item;  waited a few minutes.. no reward.  Went out of hte cave.. came back in and dropped hte item.  Picked it up again and still nothing.   I only had time to try one mission.  Will try more later.

Just wnated to pass along what I saw    Thanks FC for working on getting this fixed.  Missions are really all I do.  Hard to play when they arent working properly.

Nelida @ 11/16/2001 7:21:38 PM (Still have some mission issues... 507):
After the latest fix there are still some issues.

1. Now missions are closer but there are NO far missions. Can't we have some VARIETY please?
2. When requesting missions I OFTEN get ALL 5 missions to the same zone. Can't we have some VARIETY here also? Perhaps only one mission per zone at each request?
3. I don't know about other but I WON'T take a mission with a random piece of clothing as a reward. Are there a LOT of players out there that want clothing rewards for missions? Somehow I doubt it...
4. Mission terms in 20k only show 2 missions on request.

Thank you.

Hossley @ 11/16/2001 7:26:47 PM (Can't target NPCs in next room with HOM 509):
Okay,

I understand not being able to target characters in the surrounding rooms if the door is shut (I always thought it was some great futuristic targeting device I had, but what the hey ). 

However, because of the "hall of mirrors" problems with mission doors/rooms you cannot target NPCs in adjoining rooms even with open doors whilst it is going on. This can be pretty lethal on higher danger missions when trying to pull a single NPC from a room with multiple baddies as you have to physically enter the room to get the action going...

Cheers,

Hoss.

Admittedly, I don't have the money for a yalmaha, and with all my fixer run buffs and my ground vehicles, I go fast anyway... but...

Couldn't you just be careful while flying over water to watch for a zone wall in front of you, and then when you see one, fly along it to land... cross the zone, reequip, and fly off?

I realize this is something we think Funcom should fix, but until such time as they can get to it, considering everything else they're doing, can't we find a way to work around it?

Just wondering...

i might be wrong, but interrupts happen when someone hits you, thereby distracting you, whereas a fumble happens based on you managing to execute the nano right.

and this might not be the right thread to cover this in, but i just had a green NPC trader counter 4 out of 4 furious assaults, while chaincasting 3 funnels, and then depriving AND ransacking me, depleting my matcrea from 416 to under 330 (last nano on my list that wouldn't execute told me i needed 330 in matcrea to cast it, no idea exactly where it was).
that was somewhat upsetting (/sarcasm off)

Goals for the Themis Group's engagement at Funcom include:

<snip>

- Moving towards a "zero surprises" philosophy with regards to player notification of fixes and changes;

- Prioritizing development efforts on issues (such as bugs) which are most damaging to player satisfaction.
			
		
	
If you want to read the whole list: http://community.anarchy-online.com/articles/976L

Now if you read the patch info, you will find no mention of the words "no" and "mission running" in the same sentence, as a matter of fact, you won't even find mission running even mentioned in the whole patch info. Still they have removed it alltogether from the game. Is this what they call "zero suprises"? 

As for the bug part, I don't even have to comment on that one. You all know what I'm refering to.

Harlequin @ 11/16/2001 7:41:11 PM (325):
hrm, along the same two hit line, can anyone tell me if cyborgs are supposed to be able to both use a projectile weapon AND hit you with a melee attack.
had a mission filled with them, and they kept shooting and hitting me in the same fight, and to my best memory that "feature" was taken out a few patches ago, but maybe this is a feature unique to cyborgs, in any case i'd like to know

D.Shaffer @ 11/16/2001 7:46:56 PM (265):
It IS gamebreaking in certain area.  In particular those mission zones with the scaffolding over the toxic waste.  You can jump from the scaffolding to the ledge's OK, but you simple CANT do the reverse.  I've died several times trying to run away from a MOB only to fall into the toxic soupl.  It's much fun their.  PLEASE fix this.

reggie @ 11/16/2001 8:19:19 PM (168):
Anyway, what about traders (referring not to the profession, but any player that is into trading)? I used to be a one-man walking shop, with all my trade stuff organized in big backpacks in one of my hotkey bars, with ie. #1=guns, #2=other weapons, #3=clusters, #4=nanos etc.... and then I usually had 3-4 small backpacks for mission junk etc. Ok, I know this is a bit unrealistic but for gods sake.... let us have some playability.

In my imagination all those backpacks just reassemble my wagon of goods that I park up on the Tir markedplace or something.

Ok, so maybe having to put 4 of the big backpacks in the bank before going on a 3-mission trip to Andromeda, to make sure I wouldn't hit the weight barrier, wouldn't be such a pain...
after all, I'm not out to sell guns to the OTs, I'm there to kill them.

But the way it is now, I have to keep everything in the bank at all times and still I'm 100% overburdened, and you can't keep stuff organized in the bank and you can't even drag them into the chat from there.

Well you're an atrox, genetically designed to be big and strong, u have maxed out strength and stamina and ur full of over-equipped implants to further increase them. You get rid of everything u absolutely don't need and you're 21% overburdened. You go do 1 mission, put loot in a small backpack, just junk like targetting scopes and monster parts and maybe a gun or two, and then you're at 80%... now if that isn't laughable,..

Funcom should learn from a company named Blizzard, they know to prioritize gameplay to realism and still noone complains, their games are the funnest there are.

It appears that tutoring does not work at all.  The new backpacks that were gifts to long time customers added +150 to tutoring.  Obviously they are trying to promote the skill because nobody uses it.  I believe they overlooked the main reason nobody uses it...IT DOESNT WORK.  I have 426 tutoring and have tried to use the skill.  You have to have the recipient join your team to use the skill on them and then you just target them and use the tutoring device.  As long as they meet the requirements of the device, you will see them flash (as if just buffed) and you will notice that the skill on your side will be reduced slightly, but no increase will occur on the recipients side.  I have sent several petitions with no response.  Has anyone been able to get the devices to work?

version 13.0 (post Nov 16th Server fix) 

When you've finished the retrieval mission and return the object to the mission terminal, you need two slots in your inventory free. If you attempt to complete the mission without room, it'll say a message to that effect.  Sadly, when you free up the room afterwards and try again, it'll take your item without giving you the reward.  The bug does not appear if you already have the free room to begin with.

Try a mission from a Neutral terminal, and post your results here. This may be a pseudo, temporary work around until the fix is pushed from test.

At any rate, bring back item missions DO work, 100%.

All weight limits are really going to do is making us pass up MORE of the junk we see in missions.. not like many of us pick the stuff up anyway.. but that tradeskill item that I find that *might* help someone who's making a new weapon is definitely either not coming with me, or is being deleted the moment I need space..

I am sitting here right now in a mission where i live with the creature and the mission wont end and the monster doesnt aggro on me either. i sent a petition so let's see if the mission ends before helps me out.

Misophist @ 11/16/2001 10:21:52 PM ("Bring back" items disappearing after mission is deleted 545):
The items that you return to terminals, the "bring back" missions, do work when you complete the mission. But say that you want to forgo the mission reward and keep the item, especially if it's a senpai cloak or non-store nano?

Well, with a cloak specifically, the item you were supposed to return disappears from your inventory after the mission times out or if the mission is deleted. 

If you give the item to another person and delete the mission, the item will disappear the other individual's inventory.

I tested this with a guild mate, so it's true. With those impossible to find new nanos, I suspect you may be able to upload the nano before the mission times out/is deleted, but I have not tested this. 

Is this intentional? If so, I can only ask that these items be provided as NORMAL mission prizes, so we don't have to "exploit" to get them. 

If anybody has found missions that offer these rare items as the actual reward for successful completion, please let me know.

Anyway, I seem to recall that a while back, people were keeping the sentinels/knights armor they would receive as the item to bring back, and this was dubbed an exploit, but perhaps because that armor was never supposed to be in the game for players.

At any rate, just wanted to give people a heads up and warn that those senpai tertius, secundus and primus cloaks may just disappear from your inventory if they were found as a return item. Just be wary of people selling these items after today. I tried to ask a person how he got a q116 primus cloak, and he was kind of shady about it. Of course, if the item was found before today, or it was an actual mission prize, then no need to worry -- won't disappear.

Holinor @ 11/16/2001 10:29:58 PM (Vehicle bug 546):
OK, first off. 13.0 bug. If you equip a vehicle, suddenly you can not interact with things in any way outside the vehicle, like spells, rightclicking the grid mahcines and things like that. Secondly, if you want to step out so that youcan interact, youfind out that is impossible. When I equip the car, it turns invisible until I close and reopen the window. When I unequip it, it disappears again, I close and reopen window, and the vehicle is still equipped. I fould no way to unequip it. I guess running through a zone would do that, at the moment I was not close to one, so I had to log out, and then relog back in again. Just thought I would open this forum with that small problem.

Ampris @ 11/16/2001 10:41:55 PM (545):
Yes.  This has been the behavior for a long time now.  At least since 12.4 if I recall correctly.  Since the intent of these missions is to return the stolen item to the terminal, it would seem to make sense that you don't get to keep the stolen item.

"If anybody has found missions that offer these rare items as the actual reward for successful completion, please let me know."

What you want to do is the "find item" missions (eye over cube when using max money / max bad) and not the "return item" missions.  With a "find item" missons, once you find the item you get to keep it and the mission reward.

I have seen those cloaks and nano cystals that aren't sold in stores as the item to be observed / found in "find item" missions.  I think all non store nano are available as mission rewards.  Are there specific ones you are finding that you can't get?

Merengue @ 11/16/2001 10:44:30 PM (265):
I've been having the same problem, and it's awful.

This the curving room with the water in it that is in almost all cave-type missions. There is almost always a MOB in it too.

You can enter it, but it is very difficult to get out. You have to move over to the side and jump at a strange angle. On top of that, you can be standing right next to the mob and not be able to hit or have a line of sight.  If you get out of the area during the fight, the MOB will chase you, but you will not be able to see it.
Last night I ran several room away and could not break away from the fight. The MOB was still hitting me and killed me right before the mission exit door - completely out of my sight.

If you have a pet, your pet will NOT be able to get out of the water room without some serious fanagaling. I'd say 90% of the time, the pet cannot get out. 

Your only choice is to terminate the pet and re-summon out of the room.

I've been trying to avoid these rooms, but the MOB inside will attack and then my pet runs in.

These rooms were like this after the 12.6 patch, but seem to have gotten worse.

Mascot @ 11/16/2001 10:57:16 PM (515):
What does it matter. Now that you're forced to be in range of the opponents weapons you'll be dead before you can expend your nano pool anyways.

Mascot @ 11/16/2001 11:02:05 PM (499):
I think the actual timer for whether you can use the packs or not is on the server. But the client has its own internal counter on when to show you the message.

If it's the other way around, someone will eventually doctor the .exe to allow instant reuse of treatment packs :P

It looks like Themis is still "moving."

Note to Themis and Funcom: Changing the chat colors to a darker color and mkaing it so that we cannot distinguish between regular chat and links is a BIG surprise that SUCKS!

Making team chat and tells the same color SUCKS!

The old chat colors were perfect.  Can anyone give us a reason why they were changed.... without a word to the players?

I have to disagree with you here. Lots of my friends, pre 13.X (today), were keeping those coveted senpai cloaks that were the items to be returned and giving them away/selling them. Now they disappear and are worthless after the mission times out/is deleted. This was not the case before today.

Okay, you answered my question. I was wondering if you can get these items from missions other than the "retrieve/return" types. But since "find item" missions aren't working, you'll probably get the cloak/nano and that's it. No money or token. 

As for nanos, I was specifically referring to the new engineer NPs that are not available in shops. My boyfriend needs them, and so far he's only been able to get them by keeping them instead of returning them to the mission terminal. He hasn't seen them as an actual reward for completion.

Edit: I don't remember the little blurbs about "describe item" missions, but it would seem logical to say that after you describe the item, it disappears? And does this happen? I've never been in a position/level to "farm" rare items, so I'm not sure.

Isisnorfret @ 11/16/2001 11:13:58 PM (507):
For a long time now I've not been playing becuase of the mission terminal issue. Yesterday however it was beautiful, I was able to get missions in Pleasant Meadows again, and did 9 of them, having a blast untill I had to go to bed.

All day I've been looking foward to doing the same thing, but tonight I won't be playing at all, because the mission terminals will only give Aegean/Varmint Woods and occasionally TLR. As a lvl 81 trying to save up for a Yalmaha, 30k mission reward is a slap in the face. I tried the hidden/open slider and it had no effect on the location.

Please fix the mission terminals to how there were from beta untill 12.0. I don't mind spending a lot of time requesting missions, as long as there is a chance that eventually the mission will be where I want. TOTALLY randomize location, or do something, make it so we can get missions where we want. I simply cannot bring myself to play this game with the mission terminals as they are.

cson @ 11/16/2001 11:18:40 PM (504):
When's the last time you got offered a mission to Aegean? Even when the missions were working (pre 12.8), I stopped getting missions to Aegean after level 60. I still get Varmint Woods though.

Satherial @ 11/16/2001 11:27:41 PM (Lowering Cash Reward on Missions? 556):
Ok after spending the last 25 minutes trying to get some good missions for me to run I've been left with no choice but to come here.

Ok Funcom maybe you don't know your own coding, but in case you didn't know: The closer the mission the less cash you'll get. If you get a mission that's just 1 zone away then the reward will be noticably lower than than one that's further out.

I used to get 20-25k cash doing missions from omni ent to clon****. Now I don't even get clon**** missions from Omni ent, but I do get them at lush hills for a whopping 15k. That's the most I see any of my missions giving. They go as low as 9k (When I get them for greater omni forest).

Christ having to raise 145k for a new pet at 15k per mission... the fun... the excitement.. of sparing myself another 12.95.

Have you checked since this patch? I actually got a level 45 mission to Athen Shire! I saw plenty to Wailing Wastes, Aegean, Longest Road and even Holes in the Wall (not the bugged part!). These were all from Old Athen and Avalon.

My guess is that the only place to get Aegean missions will be Old or West Athen. MAYBE Newland. Varmint Woods are probably available in Newland, I couldn't round one up in Old Athen.

Misophist @ 11/16/2001 11:32:46 PM (507):
I am going to play my twinky level 1 trader tonight so I don't have to deal with the higher level mission crap.

My MA, at level 47, is getting 4-Holes. I can deal with that, but I bet those will phaze out after level 50ish. I know that you can get Lush Fields from certain terminals, but they pay so much less than the "distant" areas. 7k instead of 18k? Hah, I laugh!

But let's talk about cash here. I'm trying to save up for a Yalmaha. Was going great post 13.X, when I could get average missions to Lush Fields for 19k-21k. Many /terminations later, I am up to 1.4 million and 140 tokens.

Well, I can live with less money. I can. 18k isn't much different than 20k. And 4 Holes ins't such a bad area. But when I have to zone in and out of a mission 50 times and use a million nano/health kits in a 50% "easy" mission, a supposedly "closer" distance isn't much concession. 

And with the describe item missions NOT working, I'm only getting about 15-16k per mission because I have to resort to other types that pay less.

I should think all missions to the same location, no matter which style, would pay the same amount, but that's not the case. Missions were fine before. Yes, running through needed to be looked at (but not taken out as it is now!), and the token distrubution system was fixed. I really don't understand why they were changed other than that.

Merengue @ 11/16/2001 11:35:43 PM (540):
What's really bad is that you cannot distinguish between who is actually selling something on the chat channel and who is using it for chat.

Before this mess, you could simply scan through the purple links to see what is for sale. Now you can't.

Of course, why would anyone from Funcom be using the shopping channel?

Someone at another thread suggested that is was a flaw from the PvP fix. When my MA fights human MOBs the damage is minimum, but whenever I fight monster MOBs I still do normal damage. It appears that human MOBs have been included in our damage limitation for PvP.

Would be nice if someone fixed whatever is wrong though.

Satherial @ 11/16/2001 11:38:57 PM (504):
They also lowered the overall reward for cash (atleast for me).

I used to get 20k-25k for a mid difficult mission from omni ent to clon****.

Now the only missions I can get from Omni Ent are to Lush Hills for 15k or to Greater Omni Forest for 9k. At level 61 my nanos are costing well over 150k... I'm not about to do 10 missions for a single damn pet.

Kneebreakcer @ 11/16/2001 11:59:24 PM (504):
Here are mission experiences for today.   First off, I *am* seeing better variety on missions than before, but as mentioned above, for lower cash rewards.  Not that that seems to matter much.

I ran 4 missions today.  Two were assassinate and two were identify item missions.  The first assassinate mission went fine and when I killed the target I got a reward and token.  The second one had a problem.  I had forgotten to make sure that I had a couple spaces open in my inventory when I killed him.  I got a message that I needed at least 2 spots open and that the mission completion was pending.  So I cleared a couple of spaces and nothing happened.  Unfortunately, the key to the mission dissappeared so the server obviously recognized the mission as complete but I got no cash, no item, no experience and no token.

Then on to the two identify missions.  Same old story, the mission won't complete at all.  No message, no cash, no token, nothing.

Personally, I think that while the limited mission areas was a problem in 12.9, it was far better than the current situation.   Come on Funcom, let's get things working for a change.

Psiraven @ 11/16/2001 11:59:38 PM (NCU and Computer Belt bug 563):
I have a really hard time unequipping them and requipping them...they just disappear when I try to drop them in the appropriate slots and when I zone they are back in my inventory.  I have over twice the required computer lit.

I try removing my belt to the inventory and it disappears and when I zone the belt is back on and all the ncu is in place.

Hey, that's sort of good to know. I guess. I mean, I'm still hitting for crap against human mobs (my MA), but at least I know it's not normal. 

Melee attack may be the easiest to protect against. Sure. But hm, seems kind of unfair to penalize characters who enjoy melee classes. I've played NT and had a wide range of damage types to choose from, loved it. And now I'm on MA. I like getting in a mob's face, being aggressive. I just enjoy the MA profession a lot.

But it has become a chore since 13.0. I do hope they fix this.

Karmantra @ 11/17/2001 1:08:32 AM (284):
Well, I went in after the little emergency patch thing (which was supposed to "fix" missions), and I found some other problems that might have changed recently.

5. The scroll bar on all windows (especially stores) now has a smaller area for clicking in than it used to have, possibly because of the change that added scroll mouse capability. 

6. Since the optional graphics interface upgrade, I have noticed more instances of items swapping positions in my inventory again. This happened to me two times totally at random, one time was after I zoned out of a mission.

7. Since the optional graphics upgrade I also have noticed that the sleeves that you have displaying on your avatar sometimes changes when zoning. A lot of times I noticed that it seemed to put the higher QL item on my character's graphic instead of the one I wanted to show. I usually have two different color sleeves on, and this makes it hard for a woman like me to be fashionable if my clothing colors don't match.

Well, it's not such a small list anymore, but I had to add something to make sure Funcom sees this and to keep it near the top of the forum.

Isisnorfret @ 11/17/2001 1:08:54 AM (357):
They need to take a lot of things from 13.0 and roll them back, but not the whole patch. They should leave the PvP rules but reroll just about everything else.

In hopes someone from Funcom reads this, I'd like to make a statement.

Someone from the Dev team posted (don't remember where) that there were known bugs that went through becuase they didn't have time to fully test before the patch had to be released. Now, the statement I want to make is

DON'T RELEASE A PATCH UNTILL YOU'VE FIXED ALL THE BUGS IN IT, I DON'T CARE IF IT TAKES A MONTH DON'T FREAKIN DO IT

Who knows, maybe my words will echo around in Funcom's cavernous collective mind untill it reaches a patch of brain tissue somewhere in there. Having a deadline for a patch is really a stupid idea. Stupid stupid stupid. They should fix ONE thing. JUST ONE, JUST ONE LITTLE THING, and fix it CORRECTLY AND THOROUGHLY, and then make a little patch to fix that ONE FREAKIN THING. Then if that patch messes things up more REROLL IT.

(I feel the need to capitalize given the fact that ppl have suggested this very idea many times, however somehow Funcom missed the message.)

Really, I think there should be a patch every few days. That patch should fix one thing, and do it right.

(Yes, I do realize I'm ranting, got a problem with it?)

Really, first thing that needs to happen, is mission terminals need to be fixed to where they actually give missions to places both near and far! Yes, both near and far! Both! Not one! Not the other!! BOTH!!!!!!!! You guys had it right before, just put it back. Please, just put it back.

(I realize the frustration in my post may be frustrating for you, Funcom employee, to read, but keep in mind that my frustration has been caused by you.)

Anyways, about all I can do now is play a little character in the training ground, and hope someday that mission terms will be fixed and I can continue on with my goal of buying a yalmaha with my lvl 81 character.

You guys do so much, and so much of it is right, but such vital things have gone wrong that I am sticking with the game now for sentimental reasons only. My first mmorpg *sniffle* I didn't think i'd be leaving it so soon..

Ampris @ 11/17/2001 1:29:17 AM (545):
Well, I think that if you did go and delete the mission key before completing a "find item" mission, that the mission objective sitting somewere on the floor of the mission map would get deleted. I've not tried that, but it wouldn't surprise me if it worked that way.

So I think they delete the mission icon, mission key and mission objective when the mission expires or gets deleted before you complete the mission.

"but it would seem logical to say that after you describe the item, it disappears?"

Why would simply looking at or picking something up cause it to vanish?  Unlike a retrieve item mission, the mission giver of a find item misison doesn't want the item itself.

Spacegipsy @ 11/17/2001 2:06:10 AM (Bug List 582):
The following are the bugs I noticed after the patch (and the first fix for it) - probably they have been written down/mentioned somewhere else, but I'd just like to get them all in one thread:

Missions:
Won't mention broken objectives, as that is known and being worked on but
1) Some MoBs come thru locked doors
2) We do less damage (than before) on human MoBs (not only mission-related, everywhere), it's not quite half, but it's definitely less than on non-human MoBs - intended??
3) Pet following is worse than before
4) Mission completion: I took 3 *retrieve item and take back to mission booth* missions today, as they allegedly were not broken. This is what happened:
Mission 1: get message that inventory is full and completion pending, so I clear my inventory, item disappears, key disappears, no reward. Ok - my bad I think.
Mission 2 - all works fine - woot (Reward, no xp or token, cuz it was small mission - fine)
Mission 3 - I get reward, I *also* get XP - *BUT* I get no token (and no - my inventory wasn't full this time)
Getting XP and no token is new bug.
5) Mission balance: still there are anything from grey to yellow MoBs in a mission, where - if difficulty is set to 50% - it should be all greens.
6) Not sure about this one (can anybody confirm or deny?) - not only related to missions - it seems that MoBs give less XP than prior to the patch, could this be right?

Guilds:

As of today's *fix* I can neither invite nor promote anybody.
This is really bad.
Tried to invite someone earlier, he received a message and we received a message that XYZ just joined our organization. However, he can not see our guild chat, and when I target him with /org info it says he's in no organziation. When I tried to /promote him, I received the message that I can only promote members of my organization.

That's all for now. Anybody else found bugs? Please post them.

Altaire @ 11/17/2001 2:10:35 AM (Cloaking devices... Broken???? 585):
Ok, Im hearing that cloaking devices are hosed. Can you all provide some feedback so if this is really broken, it can be fixed.

First off, I always assumed that you still had to use sneak to benefit from the extra concealment that the cloaking device gave you. This seemed kind of lame since the DOT on the darn thing can cut you to ribbons. This is why I stopped using mine. 

Im hearing now, that I was wrong, and that a cloaking device is supposed to allow you to remain concealed as long as you dont attack, pick a lock, or whatever, and you DONT HAVE TO USE SNEAK. It was supposed to auto-sneak. Im hearing that this is broken. 

So, I guess I would like to know the truth of how they work and also if they were really gimped the way people have described. 

IF they are broken, I WOULD LIKE FOR FUNCOM TO TELL US IF THIS WAS AN INTENTIONAL NERF OR NOT AND HOW THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO WORK. 

Sorry for the caps, but I figured if they were skimming text, they would notice the important part of that post. 

Thanks

I'm having the same results.  I'm a 41 Fixer with a QL 57 Mausser.  I have always been able to do Medium difficulty missions, but not now.   Today I was doing TERRIBLE damage against humanoids level 38-40.  I had one crit that I could see in about 8 fights, and burst never did more than a normal shot.  The fights last MUCH longer and if it's a healer I'm totally screwed.  I used to be able to handle healers, due to my HOT.

I can't even do a yellow monster without zoning now, and that's using everything I have.

I don't know, that's what I was asking. Can't remember if the person wants the item we have to describe or what. I know it didn't disappear before, and I guess they're not disappearing now.

The original point of this post is that there's a new little twist pertinent to those who farm senpai cloaks, among other things, by keeping the item that needs to be brought back to the terminal. 

Before, they didn't disappear after the mission times out/is deleted. Now they do.

If there's another way to get these items, I don't really care, my post is moot. However... from previous experience, a lot of my buddies have done missions that ask you to return a popular item to the terminal and just don't return it. They would sell the items to other players for premium prices and not cry about losing the mission money.

If people are selling senpai cloaks farmed in this manner, for prices 3 million and up, I can see folks getting REALLY angry when their shiny new cloak disappears from their inventory after their "dealer" deletes the mission he used to get the item.

Which brings up another question: will the cloaks disappear if you're wearing them? I only tested it with a cloak in my inventory. A cloak that another player got as the "return" item for a mission and gave to me to test this very problem. He deleted the mission and the cloak went poof from MY inventory.

Blah, I type to much. But I do see this as a potential problem.

Ok, every NT out their knows about the damn stupid blackhole problem which seems to still be with us after how long?

AND the lovely new lets chain fumble problems we are getting.

AND our lovely gimped range now, which makes rooting anything carrying a gun a complete waste of time now.

AND now we have yet another, this seems to be some **** eyed timing problem. You see the mob and caste away, first nuke away and good. Switch to your mid range, or fast nuke and caste. Strangely it castes very fast, but doesn't actually execute, and deploy the nuke...no report at all. You caste again, and the same if u use the same spell. Once its done it once with a spell, it will keep doing it with that spell on that mob. Only way that seems to be around it is to change to a different spell or zone out.

Wonderful job Funcom, just wonderful.  In order to 'fix' the guilds you first break them even worse than they were before.  Your logic is inscrutable and your incompetence is overflowing.

Seriously though, I think you should take some time ('take it easy') and make sure that your 'fixes' actually, you know, fix what they're intended to fix and not break them.  A little Q&A would be nice and reduce the fustration that every single guild leader feels when he logs on to find out that he can't do ANYTHING.

Not only can we not promote and invite, but we cannot kick, leave, change gov form, and possibly disband (I wasn't going to try it).  The system seems to acknowledge what we do (i.e. 'You have been promoted to 'whatever'), but it doesn't actually do the action.  I thought guilds had it bad before, but now we are truely at a standstill.

Funcom, you had better have someone in there over the weekend fixing this, or else your going to have a lot of trouble from players come Monday.

hobbes @ 11/17/2001 3:07:13 AM (Missions still dont work 603):
Three mission outcomes

1) killed everything, looked in every chest, killed target. No money, no xp, no reward, no token, but mission icon disappears. Sweet.

2) mission in enemy terrritory. everytime I was driven from the mission a guard outside would attack me. Once reanimated the guard offered me a job. Returned to mission, had to flee once again, same guard shot me. Quit this one

3) Go get this and bring it back- worked fine, got money, xp, token

Playing my enforcer now, seems ok after patch, my adventurer on the other hand has contracted polio or something. He needs 10 minutes to kill a green- very boring.

Come on now, get with it. I only suffer with you because I paid for this in advance and you brought us The Longest Journey

can someone please comment on when it might get fixed?  heard everything from 13.0 to 13.3 (and all only "maybes")

Xombie @ 11/17/2001 3:17:45 AM (357):
Um... why would they rollback a client patch when the problems are with the serverside patch?
Missions are server-side. Just about everything about them is. Most likely they got broke during incompatabilities with the fixes to the stability problems.
So, no... a rollback would NOT be a good plan at all.
There weren't really many bugs with the 13.0 patch. The problems were with the new server patch that was released on the same day.

And i'd like to hand Sandrix a big frothy glass of shut up juice...


	
		
			
			
				They should leave the PvP rules but reroll just about everything else.
			
		
	
The only complaints i've seen with the clientside patch are the new PvP rules.


	
		
			
			
				Someone from the Dev team posted (don't remember where) that there were known bugs that went through becuase they didn't have time to fully test before the patch had to be released.
			
		
	
Somehow i find that a tad bit hard to believe, since dev's are usually prohibited from saying things like that without offical clearance. But the fact is... dev's don't have control over when the patch goes out. The publishers do. Funcom's development team isn't the ones that put out the patches.


	
		
			
			
				They should fix ONE thing. JUST ONE, JUST ONE LITTLE THING, and fix it CORRECTLY AND THOROUGHLY, and then make a little patch to fix that ONE FREAKIN THING.....Really, I think there should be a patch every few days. That patch should fix one thing, and do it right.
			
		
	
Do you have any idea how much money it would cost to have that many patches?


	
		
			
			
				(I realize the frustration in my post may be frustrating for you, Funcom employee, to read, but keep in mind that my frustration has been caused by you.)
			
		
	
You seem to think that Funcom is one singular guy.
No. The forum mods who read these boards did not cause you anything. Because they are forum mods. they don't do anything with the actual game.

Dude, they're fixing the missions with server patches. They've already fixed half of the problems today, and are working on fixing 'em completely. Just be patient. It won't kill ya.

... is it a new feature? or a bug...
i need to run mission time to time to get new stuff (nano or other). Usually i run and pray , but i find the item often, then i got the reward .
I know that atm, mission are buggy on reward, but now, i cant at all pick the item too (for retrieve mission) when i m aggroed.

That s mean that mission blitz are allowed only for conceal classes???
As a doc, i'm always broken, and now, i cant run mission anymore to get quick stuff.

Crunch @ 11/17/2001 4:15:32 AM (Loosing vehicles 611):
I know its and old issue but its not until now I can tell how it feels to loose it. But today it happend i lost my Yalmaha in what i think was server crash. I'll try to explain what i did so you other guys out there dont do the same thing.

I use a rang increaser equiped at "HUD1" when im not driving my vehicle. When I use my vehicle I just right-click on my vehicle to equip it and the rang increaser switch place with my vehicle in my inventory. To get out of my vehicle I do it the other way so, following the procedure i just described you'll allways have either your rang increaser or your vehicle equiped and its very easy keeping track of where its located in the inventory when you need it because its always at the same place.

But today...
On my way back from a mission with my inventory full of looth the server in the zone I was passing crashed (Just outside Old Athens). When i logged in the next time my vehicle was gone.
When a zone crashes you usualy enters the zone where you first zoned into it also equiped as you zoned into but (here comes the but). If you look at your skills/abilities anywhere in the zone and click accept you will be "saved" at that exact spot. If the server goes down you will enter where you last "saved".
This "save"  feature (dont know what to call it, save is the wrong word because its not like when do a struture scan or so but for the moment i cant come up with a better word). is something I use often after server patches when servers tend to go up and down every now and then just to get trough zones or get to missions. 
Now you can imagine what happens if your inventory is full and you "save" while your in your vehicle. When entering the zone agin your at the spot where you "saved" but your not equiping vehicle neiter your rang increaser so theres no room for the vehicle so you loose it.

Cant tell whats worse loosing a vehicle because you zoned with full inventory or because of a server crash but the answar I got from my petition (which took more then 5hours to get did wait for more then 4hours but had to eat something so i got my answer as an offline message) was something like "its realy sad you loost your vehicle and thank you for your time but we cant help you".

I lost my Yalmaha which is the same as 5500k credits dont know how many gamehours that can be but lets say you get about 50k per mission and an average mission takes one hour to complete its 110 hours. My calculation is rough and my friend help me but still I lost it in less then 1 sec during this server crash.

Summary: I guess we all read the first warnings when zoneing with vehicles first was cut off, so FunCom has already sworn themself free from taking any responsibility for those loosing there vehicles. And if someone can tell what happend to those who lost there vehicle before the bug was discovered im a happy listener. Cant find an end to this disgraceful tale so i leave it like this

PS:
I'm sorry to say but all this makes me wanna quit play AO. Its a great game and the whole support concept is realy great, but you (as in FunCom) need more people in that great support staff to keep the lines down to a reasonably lengt. And you also need to give the support staff more power/rights to actually help players.
Ive read all about players loosing very rare coats and other hard to get or expensive stuff beacause of bugs in the game. Ive lost more then my plane but what I lost until today dont forces me to play hundreds of hours to get back to where I where before the bug struck me, so most of the times I dont care.
I think people need to get back what they rightfully own otherwise they like me will start looking for another online rpg.
Most of my gametime I think is realy funny, I meet my friends do great missions and stuff but there has to be some way for players to show what they achieved through many hours of playing. Like those guys having a plane or those with that realy expensive armour.
I play this game for pleasure which I think most of you players do, so FunCom please help us keeping the good spirit up.

Its 4:08am, im very tired and if you dont understand **** of what Im trying to say I gladely give you an explanation in swedish some other day.

MasterJet @ 11/17/2001 4:24:08 AM (599):
I have a trader and I have been having a problem with my debuffs and funnel spells.

I will start out a fight and have the MOB on target.  I will cast and cast and sometimes a few casts in I will get a message that I don't have a target.  I haven't hit tab or F1-6 or anything other than attack keys.  Then if I hit Tab or toggle with F1 I can cast.

Well, I rely on my drains for life, and I've got to start getting out of the door at about 50% life because I can't count on being able to cast my funnel when I need it.

I mean I wouldn't mind if I fumbled or the target resisted, because I can cope with that, but I get confused when this target loss happens.

Actually, Goloc, that's the whole problem. This game is *not* what you make of it. Too much stuff doesn't work, or doesn't work consistently, or doesn't work the way it's supposed to. There's just no way to take a mess like that and make a cake out of it.

Hello ,

            by know anyone who has created an Emergency Treatment kit has noticed that, when created they only have 1 charge. Well, if I read the injector description right then they are sopose to have 75 charges. Right? Or how about the Stims. Only one. It costs about 15k just to make 1 kit. Thats a bit expensive. I wish this bugg was fixed. That way I can make some money .

If there are any doctors that read this and want the same thing. Please add some posts so this can be fixed or changed ASAP.

Mrmedic @ 11/17/2001 5:00:33 AM (462):
Hay,

       sure some of the stuff is bugged. Look at UO and EQ. This game is ground breaking compaired to them, but I can see your point of view. One thing you have to rember is atleast they try and they incourage input from the community (Us) . This game is still fun as heck. I know I'm not gunna stop playing it any time soon. But you did bring up a point about those trade skills. I really wish they were more rewarding just like BSmithing in UO was.

Satherial @ 11/17/2001 5:09:08 AM (556):
Imo it is however a Game-stopper issue. I certainly refuse to play when I have to spend about 6 hours (about 35 mins per mission, 15k a mission, 150k+ priced nanos) just to buy a pet which I will replace 2-3 hours after then.

It's bad enough the game mechanics force you to do missions in the first place (I hate them, pet pathing makes it so undesireable) but having to spend a quarter of my day trying to get a pet is absurd.

Inzidious @ 11/17/2001 5:35:10 AM (211):
Well, i agree with you all; mobs are too tough now, ridiciously uber IMO.

Anyway, i've been thinking about the developement of the NPC issue throughout the game (yes, i've been here since day 1).

Early in the game, the developers noticed we (the players) was able to take out mobs pretty fast and easy. So they changed it, making them a bit harder. Then they added buffs to the NPCs, to make them just a tad harder, and more challenging. We all agree on that right? Now to the issue here. Early in the game, and all the way to 12.8, people were enable to install insanely high QL implants due to the "surgery station bug", making us able to equip and use uber stuff in the game. Of course this made it easier to kill mobs ! Then they fixed the treatement bug, and made NO replacements (ie perhaps making use of mobile clinics (!)). This led ALOT of players unable to install higher ql implants, thus making them "weaker" in the game. The NPCs still stayed just as uber. This is why we (the chars after 12.8) are having a hard time generally in missions, unable to do more than perhaps 55-60% solo. 

And now the 13.0 hit us with the worse issue ever. Thing is, whether this is a bug or intended (perhaps the new PvP rules slid into the NPC codes as well?), Funcom, you are making gameplay time taking, boring and tedious ! I for once won't spend like 2 hours just cruising a 50% mission due ot the fact that i gotta spend an average 10-20 per mob. This is outragious.

So, in general, tone down the NPCs...they have way too high Crits (even though my evade is pretty high, i still take 4-5 crits in a fight), they have too high Evades (i miss ALOT), their AC is insane (min dmg, avg of 5-50 on a ql82 Nova), their minimum dmg is through the roof (i'm uber on armour myself), and they shoot fast like the devil himself (they get 2-3 shots on me per my one !).

And please...for gods sake, use the friggin test server as it is intended to be !

Thank you

Uber concerned player....

icedragon @ 11/17/2001 5:45:05 AM (While Doing a Mission... 616):
Well first of all I would like to point out that even after there so called patch that would fix the missions.... guess what.... they still aren't fixed

But none the less I want to know if anyone has experienced this as of yet

running though this mission doing the regular thing, killing things opening chests etc. etc. etc.  I got to one chest and this is what happened

Attempt to open chest:
 Disarm Roll Failed
 A Rollerrat has wokeup!

I looked I had taken no daamge from the exploding treause chest, but there was this Rollerrate behind me. so I figured instead of taking damage I was going to be attacked by this Greay rollerrate instead. so I prepared for battle. hit Q to initate combat and to my surprise I got this

 Cannot attack your pet
Failed To start combat...

So I tok a closer look at the rollerrat, I could target it an everything, but then I saw the name 'Frightened Rollerrat' and I was like ok so I tried one of the pet commands since it said I couldn't attack my pet. and NOTHING. so I figuered it's a bug and wnet on with things

completed the mission wich I didn't get anything for, and was heading on my way out, and decided to try the pet commands again

"/pet follow"
nothing
"/pet guard"
nothing
/pet status"
 Frightened Rollerrat: 100% Health Location: 24,32

I was like ok yeah it's definitly a bug... left the mission and came right here 

So I would like to know what is up with this? has anyone else had this... or is this just like a one time thing that I am the only one that is ever going to see in the game... now that I think about it, wish I would have taken a screen shot

Mrmedic @ 11/17/2001 5:45:08 AM (284):
Well,

       to say the least. In addition to these buggs, the changes to the missions introduced by the server side patch stink! How can a high level person even justify doing a mission for only 10k and some pice of junk reward "Cloathing"! C'mon all of my friends and I liked the missions before the patch . You just can't survive on only 10k a mission. My doctor nanos cost 120k+! And im only lvl 60.

Chimar @ 11/17/2001 6:09:45 AM (603):
Missions are totally borked.  I spent most of this evening laboring through missions and here is what I experienced (and yes I consider these to be game stopper issues):

1.  Find person missions dont work... I would find the person, click on them... wait.... click on them... wait... click on them....wait... etc...  Unable to complete a single one of these.

2.  All missions have doors that simply wont open.  This was the worst of all... I can tolerate (I dont like it but I can work with it) not being able to finish the mission if I can go through and get all the exp from the mobs in there.  But this bug cut off large portions of the mission.  One of them cut off the whole mission as the first door I found that wouldnt open was the first one you see after you zone in!

Positive - Missions were not so far away.


Please Funcom... I love your game but I am really getting frustrated here.  If my programming team at work put out code this buggy I would fire em all and find new programmers.

Inzidious @ 11/17/2001 6:28:18 AM (Loosing IP !! 620):
Today i made lvl 55...great ! So, after maxing out my main skills, putting some here and there, i had about 3000 left. I decided to put the rest in Dodge-Ranged skill (at 175), as this is my "leftover" skill to distribute IP in. Well, what happened was kinda disturbing...

As i pressed the slider to raise the skill, the bar stood completely still, it actually moved backwards (!) while draining my 3K IP. The number of the skill was still 175, not moving. Once my IP was gone, it still counted IP, and when the bar reached bottom, it started to raise again, STILL COUNTING IP ! My 3K IP was long gone, but the counter just kept on rising. When i reached top of bar (title max) it still kept counting IP into the skill. I had by then put about 100K IP into it (!), so i figured something was seriously screwed (doh). I clikced the OK button, and opened the skills again, only to see my 3K IP gone, and counter still at 175. When i hit the increase button on the skill, it started all over again counting IP and going backwards. I tried to zone after that, no result. I tried to petition after that, no result. I tried ALL my other skills to see if i got similar cases, but it only affected that one skill.

As i see it, i just got RIPPED OFF of 3000 hard earned IP !

What the hell is going on !?

meriweather @ 11/17/2001 6:59:42 AM (NT's Nullity Sphere nano, plz change its "trade skill only" status. 621):
Cosmik, Savant, whoever,

if the changes that you forced on us in 13.0 are going to remain permanent despite the hue and cry from all the NT's who have found their way to this board, then please at least give us a fighting chance.  With implants and a few levels at 55 I'd be able to use the Mk1 shield pretty soon if only I could get my hands on it.

This nano was introduced with great fanfare by Funcom as the formula that would help level the playing field for us NT's and give us a fighting chance, but as it stands now it is so rare that it might as well not exist for the majority of people playing the NT profession on Rubi-Ka 1 & 2.  It, and most of the other new line of nano's, are only really accessible to those players who have the levels and the contacts and resources within the game that most of us do not.

Trade skill only is ridiculous, I am broke most of the time trying to stay on top of my armour, formulas and implants not to mention the silly cost of chargers and health kits, I can't afford to pay the extortionate prices people are asking for the Fold Space line and the later Enfraam's series, I dread to think what NT's would be getting charged by those who can make this nano and would want to sell it.  I hear one person paid 5 million credits for Nullity Sphere Mk1.  That is plainly ridiculous.

Give us a break, change this item to mission reward or mission chest loot for missions of the appropriate quality level.

Thanks.

Well, after being so happy that the /org commands were finally working after 13.0, we scheduled a nice night to have our ENTIRE GUILD log in their 60+ characters to have their ranks properly assigned.

How embarrassing to find that the /org commands had been re-broken!

Oops.

Will this be fixed tomorrow? I would assume this could be backed out easily as a "failed change".

OH, and one thing  before using a lockpick check for traps--locked doors can and wil be trapped

The other stuff  yeah  the missions are bugged  BUT they seem to be working better today  but i did't try any of the missions besides kill missions which i understand to be working almost 100%

Vazz @ 11/17/2001 7:22:57 AM (616):
The same thing happened to just about everyone else. It happened to me twice, once from a chest and once from a locked door. Noone knows what it's for though.

spydr @ 11/17/2001 7:29:17 AM (Some nifty gameplay bugs 625):
1)  Unlootable mobs.  All to frequently, i'm getting the "you're not allowed to loot this" message.  Pre-Patch, I might get it twice a week.  Tonight, in 3 hours of play, I had it happen 13 times.  Once it happened 3 times in a row.  I havn't done missions recently, so all this was done in the field.  I've not been able to loot a grey (did a nuke-test on it), alot of greens, and a yellow-green.  I've only killed one orange, and I was able to loot it.   Other people I talked to in the game seemed to be having the same problems.

2)  "Please wait for your other special to finish."  I understand why you put this in,  but didn't you guys (at funcom) learn anything from the "Take it easy" fiasco?  I tried to use burst during a nuke (like I always used to), and I can no longer do that.  Fine, I can understand that.  I was kind of waiting for it to happen.  However, after the nuke was finished, I still couldn't  burst.  It was telling me to wait for my other special to finish.  I waited (hoping it would go away), and my gun wouldn't even shoot.  The timer went up, the timer went down, the timer went up, I got bored (and almost dead) and nuked.   This problem happened a couple of times (2 or 3), and seemed to be fixed by nuking at least once (one took 3 nukes to clear).

3)  Seeing stuff through hills.  Really annoying.  Someone in-game told me to turn on fog, and that'll fix it.  Fog was already on.  It's just annoying, and it happens, so I decided to add it here.

Zaal @ 11/17/2001 7:47:00 AM (Bugs and mission terminals. 627):
OK ok ok ok.

A couple things.

(1)  ---  I was in a mission and TWO meta's aggroed me (playing my rerolled adven)  they apperntly BOTH cast the SAME EXACT hostile nanoprogram on me and TWO of the exact same hostile program stacked and began doing me damage.  I remember reading in the old BB somewhere that this is NOT supposed to happen - that two nanoprograms of the same LINE can stack but they can't be the same nanoprogram QL, which this was.

(2)  ---  The in-game bug-report tool is getting worse.  Now I cant even play in a window and use this POS tool to submit bugs.  I crash out to the desktop ALWAYS when using this tool.  It's be great if there was a better way to report bugs...  in-game e-mail perhaps?

(3)  ---  The missions got even more screwed up in soem ways with this patch, and yes I am referring to the ALL BAD ALL MONEY setting that most people do.  It still occasionally doles out only two missions and doesn't charge for them but lately the money being offered for missions doesn't compare to what it used to a few months ago.  I am hard pressed to find missions these days that, at level 26, pay over 5k per mission.  I used to get missions for at least 8-10k at this point with my first character.  Is it intended to reduce payoff or is this also a glitch?  If it is intended to reduce the payoff then you might really want to consider getting us better mission prizes.  I rarely get items in missions that I can use and it's sad to just sell them to store terminals, when there are other people out there that can use thse items but it's NOT worth my time to try and sell these on the shopping channels (especially with my one neutral character - as sparse as the neut shopping channels are....)  Could there be some kind of virtual bulletin board in the game made so that we can advertise in our absense items that we have that other people may want?


In conclusion : the last thing I personally want to do is suggest adding new code when it's clear the code that exists is messy and poorly documented (how could all these bugs exist if it wasn't so?).  I don't wish to attack anyone at Funcom per se.  I Love this game and woudl merely like to see it get better faster.  Just get the bugs out.  Patch these bugs away and PLEASE work harder to keep from introducing new ones.  These bugs really are gamestoppers for a lot of us.  

My subscription time runs out in February.  I am playing religiously until then and I hope that I see slavation or I will NOT be renewing my account.  I will miss AO if that happens.  Please don't let that happen.

I am not an MA, but as an Engeneer, I do have a window onto melee combat.  And I have noticed that my current pet (Gladiatorbot, QL 64 shell) is doing far less damage post-patch then pre.  Before the patch, I could count on him swinging in the low 200's, with the occasinal 300 or 400 point crit.  Now, his damage is around 100 pts less per hit.  And his damage is =far= less againsed human MOBs.  Is it possible that MOB AC got bug-buffed in some fasion?  Thats what appears to have happned.

OmniEnf @ 11/17/2001 8:22:40 AM (First-Aid kits bugs 630):
First aid kits seem to be bugged.

1) Descriptions for first aid kits in basic general store do not indicate their quality levels

2) Advanced general store first aid kits only have ql90 first aid kits availiable.

3) Superior general store first aid kit descriptions do not indicates quality level

This seems to apply to every store in the Omni side

When you run the MK you can't switch weapons untill the MK terminates. Is this intended? Noticed it in 12.9 and it's still around in 13. Was this one of those hidden nurfs like burst in 12.6 and 12.9 or is it just a bug that will be fixed.

Valkenhawk @ 11/17/2001 9:57:53 AM (585):
Yes cloaking devices STOPPED WORKING. It still adds conceal but it doesn't reduce hp anymore and it doesn't give you cover like it did before, if sneak is broken you get attacked right away even with cloaker on. To top it off, SNEAK IS BROKEN TOO. You hit water, you open a door, you can't resneak and have to zone. FIX THIS BS ALREADY. Every patch you do you lose customers. Get things right for once.

In the game setup in the launcher there's an option to use a 'W-buffer' instead of a 'Z-buffer'. It defaults to the W-buffer, have you tried switching to Z-buffer ? That might help.

--- sure some of the stuff is bugged. Look at UO and EQ. This game is ground breaking compaired to them---

Yeah, this game's ground breaking allright. It's dug itself a hole that's getting deeper and deeper with more bugs than you can shake a stick at.

At least with UO you can login and play the game and the client won't crash everytime you try to login after logging out or while you're playing the game.

Rarely doesl the UO client crash. When it does it's a simple fix.

So far this game sucks ass.

I suppose AO is like lots of things- depends on what you are looking for.

I have "re-rolled" 8 times!  Whish I hadn't felt that I needed to but I did.  The game is complex and many mistakes are made in character development.

I TOTALLY agree with the trade skills complaints.  Much of the rest is sometimes true sometimes not.

Eventually I will evolve a character I truly like.  Until that time I will enjoy my 45 MA, 39 Agent and 14 MP (what kind of weapon should he use?)

I have been having a ball with my Agent since 12.8.  13.0 killed me and then the re-patch made up for it a little.  Changing professions has been fantastic.  I have gotten to play some of the abilities of professions I had not pursued high enough to enjoy.

Did a few missions today and learned I have to adjust my mission tactics yet agian- oh well.

All in all a very fun game.

Regen rate on mobs is combat at level 60 + is looking like about 100 - 125 HP regen every 12 seconds.

If I miss I actually see the damn health bar of thiers moving up... and no they are not healing or being healed.

REGEN is amazing... I dont get that type of regen with the best doc buff on me.

To top that off I have almost 2500 AC is the majors and these guys are popping me for 45 every shot ?  WTF they never hit for less than one of two numbers.

45 constant with 113 as a critical hit.  Here I am doing 14's to them knowing they have no where near the AC I have.

I dont get it...  I am 63 now wearing QL 110 elite and std Omni Pol and these guys are pummeling me.  Why do they not have a min damage cap?  I am getting beat on by a green and i mean beat on because they have no dmg min (more like a max) and have this huge regen rate and a huge AC that I can not figure out.

Looking for love in all the wrong places Im sure!

Ok I have a 35 MP and i cant get missions for over 3.5k credits at 50% anywere. 3.5k in cash will buy me some nanochargers and that is it. 

What if I want a 16 ncu mem? That would be 6 missions for 1 peice of memory! That is without taking into account the cost of nano and FA kits to do the missions in the first place. 

So basicaly my toon has come to a standstill. I cannot earn enough credits to upgrade my nanos, armour etc so thats it. 

Game stopped.

How can you carry on if you cant get a resonbable ammount of credits in a decent period of time?

Last night I looked for missions with my 70 agent. I could not find 1 mission for over 15k credits at 50%. 15k will just buy him some nano chargers.

I cannot play with no chance to upgrade nanos, weapons, armour etc so for me the game has stopped.

Missions are now a game stopper.

I feel sorry for the doctors as money is hard to come by for them already.

plaindog @ 11/17/2001 1:35:36 PM (647):
Yupp the game has stopped completely up for doctors. I play a 31 lvl Doc in Rubi Ka 2.

1. I can't do a single mission with him
2. I can't kill anything
3. My team healing spells getting me killed
4. This sucks
5. This sucks even more

My lvl 31 soldier in Rubi Ka 1 first had to do 6 missions to afford a reasonable new gun. These 6 missions was a constant zoning in and out of the mission to kill some yellow monsters. I spent about 200 health boosters to complete them.

When I finally got that new gun I did 6 more missions to get my Ncu units up to 26.......

I have on sentence that explains my feelings "This sucks 2k"

Thug @ 11/17/2001 2:06:03 PM (211):
Yep, i have a feeling that the human NPC's are somehow also tied into the PC datadase and when they halved damage for PC's they tweaked something on the mobs too, my lvl 55 MA used to be able to solo oranges no problem.. i did two missions and got my butt kicked by light greens.

I had to start a new character, my MA with FULL QL50 Implants, 1400 AC all QL64-70, senpai cloak, etc. SubG, Healing, Dirty fighter is unplayable now at his level unless i want to eek through 45% missions half filled with grey mobs that take way too long to kill.

Unfortunately this never happened to me. I don't know, whether anyone of you ever tried to disarm the trap with a bomb disarmament kit. This gives me, as a level 18 agent and the mission slider set to 50%, about 500 to 600 experience points. This is more than any mob in the mission would ever give me.

I spent FOUR hours with an ARK trying out different missions, different types of mobs, varying difficulty, with different buffs on.

We figured out the 'adventurer' based humanoid mobs had encurred a bug that caused them to have over 10 times! the ac that they should have.   

This is not a rant, but a thread to see how many people were having the problem. This enabled me to tell the ARK that it wasnt player restricted, but was happening to all varying profession, not only MAs but enforcers, adventurers and such like too.

After spending the time with the ARK, it enabled him to write a very thorough report, which i HOPE will get through....

I agree they should make a notice of it, so that people who do not read the forums, will know that it is a bug.

Weapons vendors - Either Overstocked *which is good* or completely empty *which is bad* 

I've found that a lot of the shops are real screwy, but I did notice one of the weapon shops must have held about 150 weapons.

For instance I found a full line of QL5 to QL60 Maussers on one vendor. same vendor had full lines of bows, shotguns, etc. 

I go to another vendor and it's completely empty.

Mustafo @ 11/17/2001 3:11:48 PM (582):
Doors especially in missions are not working correctly,  or at least they were changed.

Aimed shot and NT nanos(long run time) are best done before you are attacked by a MOB. Since the last patch I can't target through an open door most of the time.  I can't sneak into a room with my agent and certainly can't walk into a room with my NT unnoticed.  I was not completely unhappy with the 40m cap, but it did have an affect on my tactics.  Not being able to target though open doors makes aimed shot completely useless. Also makes the big long run nanos that do alot of damage harder to get off before the MOB attacks you.  I certainly don't want to stand in front of anything for 9 seconds while the nano runs and they attack me.  I just don't have the HP for that.

I do like it that the MOBs can no longer attack you through walls.  Thanks for that.

Mustafo

Mustafo @ 11/17/2001 3:16:08 PM (650):
was a bug fix.  They fixed it so the nano requirement is checked before running the nano.  If I remember there is a 70% additional nano required to run nanos under FP.  Used to be that it wouldn't check before hand and then just take all you nano when it was run.

Mustafo @ 11/17/2001 3:20:07 PM (651):
I saw that too the basic shop in newland had about 3 to 5 vendors worth of stuff.  I found ql1 to ql40 maussers in this shop.  About 7 different ones in all.  They were also lined up which made it easy to find them.  Went to another shop in Athens I think and it had nothing in the weapons shop.

Shopping list: (You can get all of them at the Tools terminal except one. Be sure, to avoid combining problems, that all parts are about the same quality level .)
1. Antiseptic Jar
2. Basic Bio-Comminutor (Combine with Monster parts to get Blood Plasma)
3. Mimicing Cellular Oil
4. Revitalizing Serum
5. Treatment Laboratory Bot-Injector
6. Monstor Parts (Common loot items for mutants)

( You need 90 skill in Pharma Tech to make QL 20 kits )
Combine them in this order:
1. Combine the Mimicing Cellular Oil with the Antiseptic Jar
2. Combine the Revitalizing Serum with the Antiseptic Jar
3. Now Take the monstor part and combine it with the Basic Bio-  Comminutor and you should get "Blood Plasma".
4. Combine the newly created "Blood Plasma" with th Antiseptic Jar. (The Antiseptic Jar will turn RED.
5. Combine the Antiseptic Jar with the Treatment Laboratory Bot-Injector. 

Now you should have an Emergency Treatment kit.

Satherial @ 11/17/2001 3:40:58 PM (556):
In missions before I would get creds for kills as well. I would end up coming out with about 30-35k. With my next pet costing 159k I don't think getting 20 per mission is exactly fair. I don't want to have to devote my life to playing this game in order to have fun.

Satherial @ 11/17/2001 3:45:01 PM (647):
Yup I have the same problem.

Ive found its most frustrating if you get poisoned and need to zone ,, and the zone takes forever .... when you finally do make it out your life has taken a massive loss if you live at all. 

This is due to the same problem as grid campers. Your body actually starts taking form before you are even done changing areas, thus rendering you susceptible to damage from someone on the outside or poison damage that you cant even counteract untill you change areas.

 This as well as many other bugs is making me wonder how much longer i am going to give funcom before i cancel membership.

 I would like to add to funcom, that gamers in US (i cant speak for rest of world) are usually intolerant to bad programming and impatient as well, it seems funcom dosent quite understand that.

Holinor @ 11/17/2001 5:13:34 PM (556):
I will try to get a shorter version of my disappearing post here.

Why are missions close? Because a NUMBER of players screamed for it. A LOT of players.. of course without vehicles. 

So they followed popular demand. Well, it was a misunderstanding. People were not complaining about how far they would have to teleport, they were complaining of how far they had to walk AFTER they had teleported. Now, Funcom took the complaints about missions to Stret West Bank from Omni, and the complaints about how far the aftergrid walk would be, and thought them the same, so they put all missions really close. By popular demand. Soon, the people complaining about that walk will have cars or airplanes, and then they will come back into forums, complaining that they have nowhere to go with their shining vehicles, since all missions are really close.

I feel sorry for Funcom over this one. It was a "Damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation.

Yes, many of us have commented on it. My 47 MA is close to unplayable right now. Well, I can play, but I don't feel like dealing with it because it's just not much fun. A lot of it has to do with the incredibly high AC mobs seem to have. Intentional? God, I hope not.

Wheter or not who screams loudest on the boards, there is always room for compensation.

There are 6 mission slots when you request a mission from the terminal. Why are only 5 of these filled with options? (the same i can ask about loot windows etc, but that's another issue). To compensate for all players demand, there should be more viraity to the missions, more missions to choose from, and perhaps more different settings. Like adding another setting where you can actually choose if you want a close or a distant mission.

Just a tought...

Misophist @ 11/17/2001 6:25:14 PM (404):
Bethany, I was thinking about doing the same thing with an ARK, but I didn't have time to wait for a response. Thanks for letting somebody know in-game. I hope it gets the attention it deserves.

I'd also llike to add that I am having a lot of trouble with not only the adventurer types (having less trouble with them, honestly), but also soldier and enforcer NPCs. They hit really hard, really fast and I hit a lower minimum damage than they do. Plus they have damage shields that can do 10-20 points of damage per tick. And they regen REALLY fast. 

Note: I am talking about even con or pale orange MOBs in this instance (found on 50% missions). But I do hit minimum against green and gray MOBs of the same type, as well. 

I post here in the event that a fix will be "coming up". Heh.

Neryn @ 11/17/2001 6:26:36 PM (Health bars not updating 706):
Ok, I don’t know if this has been posted by anyone before or if it is a known issue or not, but I do consider it a game stopper issue.

It happened to me twice so far today. It started when I was hunting in the Newland desert area with my level 21 agent. I did a aimed shot on an orange nighthowler, which showed the 40+ damage, then it ran out of range before coming in at me. I was just standing there, not attacking, so I hit “Q” a couple of times to try and reinitiate combat. Nothing seemed to work, I just stood there and so did the nighthowler, none of us seemingly attacking or doing any kind of damage. I did notice between the “Take it easy” messages a “reloading” message. At first I thought maybe I was stuck in a reload so tried reloading manually. About this time the night howler falls over dead, I get exp and the “You can loot these remains sort of message”.

Now, during that whole fight I had taken no damage, no messages, no reduced health bar. So I then target one of those eye mutants, and fire away. At first it seems like I am missing because I am just standing there firing and nothing. Then all at once he runs over to me and I get a spamming of damage messages that I did to him and his life bar drops immediately to all empty, no red showing. My life bar on the other hand shows 190 out of my possible 250, which would have been about right cause he got in 3-4 hits according to the chat window. I notice I am hitting him for 35-40-29 damage hits with his health bar completely empty and he’s not falling over dead. With what just happened with the nighthowler, I figure I better use a first aid quick cause I might need to run if the eye was bugged and wasn’t going to die. As soon as I apply the first aid kit I drop over dead, 0 life left “You can reclaim your items in 60 secs…”

I go and get my belongings, wait out the residue effects and go try it again. Same thing, I kill a shade, show no damage, so just for the hell of it I give myself a first aid. It showed I was healed for 30 points and my life went from 250 to 222. I can only assume I was down to 192 originally, and it was not showing up in my health bar.

Well, I don’t know about any of you, but if you cannot tell how much life you have left, or how much life whatever you are fighting has left, it definitely is a game stopper. How can you possibly play?

Nianna @ 11/17/2001 6:30:53 PM (Take it easy - how to recreate 707):
Take it easy is a real pain.  Please find some way to fix this bug.

I know that fixing bugs requires recreating them and maybe you've had some difficulty there, so I've gone and figured out exactly how you can get take it easy every time.

To recreate the "Take it easy" bug:

Get a character with a slow, high damage, long range weapon that is likely to kill all the stuff in the newbie backyard in one shot.  I used a QL120 S.A. Secure Home Defender on my level 87 Trader character.  Walk to somewhere in the middle of the backyard where you can tab and see more than one monster in attack range.  Now target one and hit Q to attack.  The attack takes awhile to happen, so before it has happened tab to another monster that's within range.  As soon as the first shot goes off (which will kill the monster), hit Q to attack another monster.   This will give Take it easy nearly every single time.

As you can see this is something that happens a lot in combat if you are fighting multiple targets because you have a tendency to switch targets rapidly when a monster dies and start on another one.  The character has a disengage from battle animation and if you try to attack another monster before the disengage animation ends when something dies I think you get take it easy.  Please please please I beg you please fix this.

Platypus @ 11/17/2001 6:47:51 PM (Bug with Cyborg Barracks 708):
I petitioned about this the other day and the ARK said he was unaware of the bug. This is the bug we had:

When a team tried to go through the door, we would end up going into different "playfields" of the dungeon. Someone would end up in a different Borg barracks.
If the team went in together, there was a better chance of staying together.

In the dungeon with a full team... if one of them would go outside, they wouldn't be able to re-enter the same "playfield" with their team.

This has happened with 2 different teams I have been with, and both had same problems.
Kind of sucks after getting through tuough battles to have a teammate needing to run but only get seperated.

Well I can say that before the 13.0 patch my level 8/9/10 toon was getting a LOT of missions for Stret East Bank. Is that what you would call a reasonable distance for a new toon Nomoore?

Also you have to consider the ammount of time some people have to play. I for one dont want to spend to much gametime "running" to locations. I dont want to spend a lot of time in game doing something I dont enjoy. I now enjoy missions even less than before.

I like to spend time leveling with my mates not have to do 20 missions alone just to get some new kit. Now if the kit was cheaper from the stores then I wouldnt mind taking missions for 15k 

AO is a form entertainment, if people dont enjoy they leave, it's as basic as that. There are allways more programs to watch and games to play. At the moment I still enjoy parts of this one but when that wears off I will try a new one.

hobbes @ 11/17/2001 7:35:28 PM (702):
Not a retreive mission, it is an activate mission. I have 150 misssion tokens, I've done this before, I was just hoping that the rules had been changed or something. Nope, just a ****ed up game, run by **** heads. 

Since my last post, I ran a return object mission. I would recommend those because they work. Problem occured in 2holes trying to grid. A player named Tzetze (vector involved in sleeping sickness) attacked me in my Turbo. I retreated successfully. I could not heal myself in the car, could not remove the car, could not log out. Five minutes later, car finally disappeared and I could proceed. What the ****, seriously!

Did you know this game was released in Juanuary of 2001,still doesn't even work in the most basic sense. That is why I use profanity. Such potential, but such poor exection and p.r.! 

Reminds me of my high school English teacher who despised me because he knew my potential, but I kept turning in crap. I told him that although I could technically write well, it bored me and I could care less. Now I understand his anger, difference is that I have paid Funcom to care or at least pretend.

Cool, Funcom has a program which censors profanity, I did not have those * in my original post. Guess I'll use more exotic words next time.

False professions are not nearly as good as true professions.  I think they've always had higher nano costs, but in the last patch they made it so the game actually checks to make sure you have enough nano to cast with the increased nano cost.  Before it would just set your mana to 0 if the spell costed more mana than you have and it would allow you to cast any spell if you had the normal nano cost worth of nano energy.

The currently enforced nano requirements with false profession in a nutshell:

823 - Reckless Digitization
1058 - Instantaneous Encoding
1313 - Grid Phreak
2003 - Team Grid Phreak


Nano cost modifier

+150% - False profession
+70% - Assume profession
+15% - Mimic profession

Interrupt modifier

+75% - False profession
+50% - Assume profesion
+15% - Mimic profession

Nano initiative modifier

-2000 - False profession
-1500 - Assume profession
-750 - Mimic profession

Nano range modifier

-50% - False profession
-25% - Assume profession
-10% - Mimic profession

Nano skills modifier (all 6 nano skills)

-25 - False profession
-80 - Assume profession
-140 - Mimic profession

Duration

30 mins - False profession
45 mins - Assume profession
60 mins - Mimic profession

>> . Please please please I beg you please fix this.

I beg them to not "fix" but just rewrite the whole combat system from scratch because it is a programming joke.

I just died again from not being able to heal because the game thinks I'm in a fight when I'm not. An omni cast a DoT on me and I died while watching my health go down reaal slowly, running and jumping around in a despair trying to find a place where it would work to sit down and heal up. Just no response when clicking treatment..... lost 70% of a level, that was 2 hours of work. I'm really quitting this game...

reggie @ 11/17/2001 8:37:34 PM (582):
Getting XP and no token is not a bug, at least not a new one... I've always worked to clear my missions 100% before going to the target person and out of the cases where I manage to do that without accidentally running into him (not easy with the crazy indoor seeing and targetting of mobs), I would say I get a token in 50% of the cases.

Neryn @ 11/17/2001 8:53:30 PM (706):
Ok, is it just me or what. Now I decided to chance hunting somemore, manage to kill stuff despite the continued troubles with the healbar, but when I go to loot i constantly get the "Your not allowed to loot these remains" message. I get the you earned 2xx exp points message, then the you are allowed to loot these remains message, but when i run up to the corpse, it then tells me I cannot loot the remains. I am hunting solo so what gives??? No one else is around when i kill stuff hurting the monster so that should not be an issue. 

Are other people having these issues?? Should I try uninstalling and reinstalling the game? Thanks in advance.

cman @ 11/17/2001 8:54:30 PM (707):
another way to get the take it easy message every time, is to attack a mob and take off with it chasin you (like you would do if you are pullin mobs to a group)...if you go out of attack range while pullin by outrunning the mob a lil, when it comes back into attack range you will now be bugged

Anyone else tired of seeing that each time you grid (in this case to meetmethere)? This came with the last patch Funcom, so it should be fixable.

ayabe @ 11/17/2001 9:13:30 PM (556):
Again a simple solution to this problem is to have a distance slider as has been said numerous times before. People screamed and whined about the distances they have to travel at lower levels. Well I say tough. We all had to go through it, and I dont think that decapitating mid to higher level characters shoudl be done to satisfy newbies. Get a car! or ride the grid. I used to be able to get Missions in Andromeda and Clon**** from Avalon for 40K per. Now the best I can get is Wailing Wastes for 10k. Its also kinda funny that it takes me longer to run to the WW missions than it ever did to get to Andromeda or Clon****. Oh yeah and the item find missions are totally broken. Great patch. I am totally frustrated and fed up. This is unacceptable, either put a distance slider in, or change the missions back to the way they were. Also now half of the mission rewards are tattoos or leopard print pants. Noone wants that crap, how about some cyber armor or a nice pistol? No? Didnt think so.....

While I was starting my new character I noticed an interesting bug.  I was trying to buy a Treatment kit from the newbie vendor in Omni 7 Virtual.  It says it costs 149 credits.  I had exactly 149 credits.  I could not buy it or even select it to buy. 

When I finally got the cash I had…

165 credits on me.
149 credit cost for kit.
16 credits should be left after buying the kit.

I bought it and I only had 15 credits left.

I tried other items like lockpicks and such and they did the same thing, off by 1.

(It appears the actual cost for items is 1 credit more than what is being shown.)

I had two stacks of bullets which I was unable to combine into a single stack.  I grabbed one stack and right clicked on my wielded Cobra and the gun ammo was loaded and was correctly displayed when shift left clicked.  I grabbed the second stack and right clicked on my Cobra, the gun loaded BUT the amount of ammo was not shown correctly on the weapon until after I zoned.  At that point when I shift clicked it showed the correct amount.

The Funky Mission Door Blurs happen to me often.  I sent in screenshots awhile back.

It appears to be something to do with the doors opening and closing.  Sometimes I hear the sound of a door shutting but the door remains open graphically and at that moment the doorway blurs.  If nothing is near the door and it graphically shuts the blurs stop.  I can also open it and it is okay.  But anytime I hear that sound of a door shutting and the door remains open it blurs horribly.

Yeah, that's helpful.  If they don't want them in the game, they could just tell us, or change the message to something that at least makes sense.  
Like "Were sorry you wasted your time and money on this; we're never gonna fix it, so you might as well delete it and don't bother getting another one."  At least that would be honest.

Allright, I've got a deflection shield, and it requires parry skill 60 to use.  What it's supposed to do is raise a deflection shield for X amount of time, and lock parry for a minute or so.  It just plain doesn't work.

I try to use it (in my inv, or worn, doesn't matter), and it tells me that I can't do that, and to check the item.  I've tried using when I had a mob that was fighting me targeted, with me targeted (in and out of combat), with nothing targeted (in and out of combat), with my friend targeted (in and out of combat), and with an enemy (a clanner - in and out of combat with mobs) targeted.

No matter what, it just tells me I can't do that, and to check the item.

Just in case you're wondering, I raised parry to skill 61 (just in case).

I have a few questions:

1)  Does anyone else have this problem
2)  If you don't, how do you get it to work
3)  Did I just completely waste IP in parry

Regarding the unlootable monsters, I have seen this most when I fight multiple monsters in a row before looting.  Let's say there are 2 monsters in a room.  I pull them and kill one at a time.  When I try to loot the first one I killed, I get the message about not being a member of the looting team (I'm not on a team at all).  This happens regardless of the order I attempt to loot the 2 corpses.  I can loot the last one I killed just fine.  Sometimes I can loot the first one if I wait awhile.

It just happened to me in a mission, that in a large room with a table in the centre, me on one side, the mob on the other side I was unable to either execute a detain suspect (because the target was out of range) or make an aim shot (because of no line of sight). But we (the mob and I) were both larger than the table and we definitely were not 25 m apart.

I also encountered an invisible barrier in Wailing Wastes when approaching a mission area at 2010.1, 965.8.

I think there is still a lot of work to do in the game world.

Ashuras @ 11/18/2001 1:15:06 AM (MOBS have UNFAIR HITPOINT REGEN! 759):
I've posted below in the mechanics board.. but then.. I thought it should be a BUG instead:

http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sho...=&threadid=758

Funcom, are your MOBS on STERIODS ? 

I've just noticed that they REGENERATE hitpoints at an IMPOSSIBLE RATE. 

I can SEE their hitpoint bar moving back even when I was fighting. 

It is almost as if they have a HOT on them ALL THE TIME! 

I cannot even see my hitpoint bar move back that fast with a HOT on me! 

This gets worse with those mobs that have lots of hitpoints (eg. Enforcers). 

With this kind of regen speed, they don't need to cast heals anymore. 

And.... previously, when I have a tough fight at the entrance, when things were pretty even and both and the mob were almost dead, I ran away .. ie. zone out. 

Healed up with heals + treatment kits + 1st aid, etc. And when I zone back... *&(!@#^ the mobs have fully recovered as well! 

What is the meaning of this ? Those mobs are NOT healing mobs.. how can they recover so fast ? 

It is VERY UNFAIR. I don't mind if they are healing mobs.. but they aren't! 

Sigh... it's almost impossible for me to kill anothing that cons higher level than me now. No matter how many times I zone out to recover

Ashuras @ 11/18/2001 1:17:10 AM (Weapon Reload BUG 762):

It seems like after the last patch that the /org commands are communicating fine with the chat client, but not with the actual database. Do we need to get the DB2 team on the phone?

Hopefully this is fixed quickly. We had a major get together planned for today for the sole purpose of assigning proper ranks.
This has made a lot of people change their schedule, and left us wondering why the patch wasn't throughly tested before it was promoted into production.

Draizen @ 11/18/2001 2:44:30 AM (759):
Yeah, I've noticed that too, and I find it very irritating. I run out, the mob is at 15% or so. I heal twice and get back up to 50% health. Then when I go back in, the mob is back up to 50% too!

Draizen @ 11/18/2001 2:48:54 AM (736):

Draizen @ 11/18/2001 2:56:32 AM (211):
Just now I had to give up on a mission because of a Rookie OT Huntsman that was listed as 1 level higher than me.
Reason, it was hitting for 22 each time and was getting 2x as many hits as I was in the same amount of time! Plus its damage shield never seemed to wear off even after 15 mins of solid combat and it didn't even rebuff once. And my Mausser, which usually hits for around 36 was hitting for an average of 12! Maybe there was some mistake with the MOB's AC level, because the only visible armor it had was a flak armor vest.
I've had to give up on about half the missions I've taken because of this problem (usually after spending about 20 mins getting there...) and it REALLY annoys me! >(

Loonybeer @ 11/18/2001 2:59:33 AM (625):
A few days ago I send in the unlootable mobs bug by mail and got the following answer


	
		
			
			
				Hi,
Sometimes mobs get stuck in water so that they can't attack 
back and just constantly run, in order to minimize the 
impacts of exploiting this, mobs often aren't able to be 
looted if they die when they are stuck or are in water.  Not 
that I'm accusing you of exploiting, just letting you know 
why this might have happened.  
There are various other reasons why a mob can't be looted, 
but they are extremely rare, and we are working on getting 
them fixed.  If the problem becomes worse (you get more 
corpses you can't loot) please write back.  Thanks for your 
input on the bug, its always helpful for our programmers.  
Hope to see you on Rubi Ka soon.
			
		
	
The reason for him to mention mobs stuck in water several times was that I send in the a screenshot showing me and the unlootable mob in a water area. But since you say that this happened to you 13 times in three hours I don't think that this explanation will satisfy you. So keep on turning in bugs and hope that things get better.

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 4:31:01 AM (556):
I used to get great missions for like 50-60K but now the most I get is 20-30K credits and this bad.  It costs me almost 1 million in credits for a new set of implants, so that means I now have to do about 30-50 missions just to get them and since missions take so dang long at my level (lvl 60), about 60-90 mins each, this has made missioning for credits not viable.  So that's at least 30-50 hours worth of game play.  Say 1-2 months for me.  By the time I get enough money for the implants I will have leveled passed the ones I want to use.

As usual Funcom interpeted all our requests bass ackwards.  The problem before was that nearly 90% of the missions were to the same place (or really far away and nearly impossible to get to alive) and it took a good deal of mission mining to get three decent missions.  What we wanted was a variety of missions to choose from, some close for less money some far away for more money.  Previously they were all far away or to the same place, which wasn't good.  Now we have the opposite all close for little money, which is even worse.  

I would like to spell out what, in my opinion, most players would like to see out of missions.

1)  A nice variety to pick from (regardless where we put the difficulty bar, that should just represent how hard the monsters and NPCs are in the mission itself.)

2) Missions take way too long to complete once you hit lvl 53 or so.  Either make them shorter or increase the number of mission tokens you get.  Missions are boring enough as it is, making us play a map that take 90-120 minutes to complete is just plain boring.

3) Can you do anything to improve the type of items we get?  

4) Can you make missioning a little more fun?  I wish I had ideas for you, but hey I don't get paid the big bucks to do that.  That's your job.  

I just don't get Funcom.  What are they doing and are they even listening?

An official response to this would be nice.

Thanks,

Thrin

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 5:15:38 AM (556):
If you aren't lvl 50 or higher it probably doesn't seem like an issue to you, but wait until you get there.  It will suck, trust me!

This is just disgusting.  Just when I thought Funcom was starting to get it together.  Ugh!!!

This is a barren environment that starts out in a V shape and widens out as you move foward. Going 'back' does not help.

I end up SW of Tir City about a minutes run in distance. There are no trees, rocks, Mobs, nothing! 

Has anyone else experienced this?

Not only do missions suck BIG TIME for levels 50 or higher half of them don't even give the frickin award!!!  This just plain sucks.  Just when I though they were getting it together.  

Don't they even test this stuff?  If they can't get players to play on the test server the go hire a few testers to play AO all day long.  I bet the turn-around for that position is going to be large, considering how frustrating AO can be.  hehe lol!!!

Kichigai @ 11/18/2001 6:15:34 AM (Mob Spawning Broken? 777):
Am I the only one who's noticing this? The spawning algorithm in this game is for s*it. At least in Tir County and Varmint Woods, there usually ain't no critters to be found, unless you happen upon their "party spot"--i.e. the one tiny spot on the map where, for whatever reason, just about every creature in the zone is congregated.

Or unless you finally, in desperation, wander into a dangerous area; an area you really shouldn't be in. Then, all of a sudden, twenty aggressive reds may spawn at once within ten meters of you and you're dead. This has happened to me three times recently and I've lost tons of experience because of it. Needless to say, I'm pissed (off, for you Anglos).

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 6:28:42 AM (294):
As a lvl 57 NT this just plain sucks.  Between fumbles and targets countering Funcom must really have an agenda to keep ppl from playing NT's.  I nearly get killed by grey mobs (4-5) in missions.  Not because they are all that tough but because I run out of nanos so fast and have nothing left to fight with.  I would say on average 30-50% of my attempts are either countered or fumbles.  Just pathetic.

Apparently Funcom wants me to stay here for the next couple of hours, because this mission isn't letting me complete it.

Normally you'd just double-left click on who you had to observe and that would complete the mission. Now? Damned if I know what to do to get these to complete.

Little help here, Funcom?

I've encountered a locked door bug in those rooms wtih 2 doors leading to them. eg. one of those "classroom" type of rooms.

When one of the door is locked and the other isn't locked....

I go the door, it opens.. but I CANNOT move thru. There is an invisible force field 

THen I went to the other door.. it's locked. I unlocked it.

And I went back to the "forcefield" door... now I can pass thru.

Minor bug, not a game stopper, but just to let u guys know.

Loonybeer @ 11/18/2001 12:07:22 PM (783):
Well, yesterday I started the new character, and since I hate hunting in the newbie grounds I wanted to do some missions in the backyard area but these are all "locate person" -- missions. But due to the fact that they are still broken I was unable to complete even one of them. I think this is very frustrating for new players. So FUNCOM I hope this is number one priority on your list.

thatotter @ 11/18/2001 12:08:33 PM (487):
I have been trying to draw attention to this problem for ages now with very little support, the problem is that its only a REAL problem after about level 100 and there are not enough casters here to support me.  I have yet to meet a caster in game that is not totally annoyed by this, we can only cast between heals and now we cant cast from a distance, now we have about half our fight in fumbles and most of the rest are resisted.

NT = No Threat

Thug @ 11/18/2001 12:26:32 PM (284):
5. The scroll bar on all windows (especially stores) now has a smaller area for clicking in than it used to have, possibly because of the change that added scroll mouse capability. 

-------------------

This is because some shops, like the weapon vendors are sometimes carrying three times the regular inventory, so the scroll bar to the side shrinks down because you have more to scroll through. hehe.


The only thing I notice about the graphics conversion is that sometimes when zoning now i get dumped *although that hasn't happened at all tonight, so it might have been a serverside issue and not the graphics conversion* 

As far as the mission rewards go, do what everyone else does. Do 3 missions, /terminate. do 3 more /terminate. do 3 more /terminate. 

My MA is level 55 and is completely decked out now until level 70, and has 1.5 mil creds. *well I just transferred 500k to my new fixer i'm playing with* 


EVERYONE at one point or another has to stop leveling and start terminating. especially if you GROUP. I see a lot of characters that group all the way to level 80, get there in 2 weeks time and now they're totally gimped because they don't have money for anything. 

So use the terminate method until they get the new coding for missions in and the distance slider.

WGMelchior @ 11/18/2001 12:27:03 PM (795):
Happens sometimes, mainly in the tradeskill booth in shops. It seems like sometimes, it occurs to a lot of booths, and later all works fine.

WGMelchior @ 11/18/2001 12:28:22 PM (783):
Servers are down for (yet another) patch. I REALLY hope the'll get it right this time.

Thug @ 11/18/2001 12:35:19 PM (647):
Ok I have a 35 MP and i cant get missions for over 3.5k credits at 50% anywere. 3.5k in cash will buy me some nanochargers and that is it. 
----------------------

Gee, my level 17 fixer is getting missions for 2.5k and i only have to go one zone away. 

I haven't played my 55 MA in a few days, but i'm relatively certain this is not entirely true. 
......................................
Full Money/Full bad. 50%.
......................................

As for the Human NPC's, YEP! that's exactly why i started a new character. my MA is fully decked out and can barely handle 1 light green now. where he used to be able to fly though deep yellow/orange mobs. 

I have sympathy for the doctor that posted here. i can fully understand your plight.  

The money thing though is just laziness. my MA stopped leveling at 55 and started doing full money/full bad missions *in sets of 3* and /terminating after those three missions and getting more. he's decked out with everything he needs to get him to level 70 now and has 1.5 mil left over. 

Sounds like a pittance?  well i've also given about 1 mil in creds to a friend who just spends the $ like crazy and always seems to come up short for implants because his wife likes to go shopping in the Miir stores. her cash cow is about to run out though. hehe. because my fixer needs mucho money!

At level 55 My MA is also 20 tokens short of the 120 token board boost. why I see level 80 initiate MA's walking around i'll never know. leveling is only 1 very SMALL aspect to this game. once you start realizing that, things will change for the better.

NEED A FIX SOON
got lots of people waiting now.....

Thug @ 11/18/2001 12:52:10 PM (556):
Again a simple solution to this problem is to have a distance slider as has been said numerous times before. 
---------------------

COSMIK has ALREADY stated that the dev team is VERY impressed with the idea of distance sliders and you will probably see it in the brand new mission coding they are working on.  Until then there are a LOT of work arounds to get money without leveling as well. 


it's called do 3 missions and /terminate!
do three more and /terminate
do three more and /terminate!

Your missions are CLOSER now so it won't take as long to go back and get three more. 

What your complaining about is pure laziness on your part!

Now, A LVL 10 character getting NOTHING but Clon**** and Stret East/West Missions (IS) a GAMESTOPPER. because they have NO HOPE IN HELL of making it that far to do a mission. 

Yes, Money is an issue, I understand. but the perfect way to work around it is by doing what i've just stated.  THis game has MANY more aspects than just Uber leveling! and if you don't realize that your gimping your character anyways so what's the point.

Like I stated in another thread, I saw a level 80 MA today walking around with less than 60 tokens. my level 55 is 20 away from the 4th upgrade. there are a LOT of things to focus on in this game. leveling isn't the only one. if you see it that way perhaps EQ is the game for you.

I agree however, money needs to be raised.  I also agree, and Cosmik has said that he agree's also, Assassin Missions should pay more than describe item missions. Murdering someone SHOULD pay more shouldn't it?

You should be ecstatic that funcom has even bothered to do the last two emergency patches instead of waiting another 2 weeks.

My god man, I thought I was bad *this is braedon*

I'm completely thrilled by the fact that they are fixing the 13.0 bugs. and the distance is finally worked out until the new mission system is implemented. and yer crying about how you level too fast and don't make enough money.  Well Boo Effing Hoo.

I seriously doubt that my MA having made probably over 3.5 mil by level 55, given away 1 mil, invested the other mil in high QL equipment and implants, and still has 1.5 left over, is the richest level 55 in the game.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 12:54:06 PM (302):
Yep, I love watching them cast while my MA dies, now, too.  It gives me something to do.  I haven't checked it from the NT side, so I don't know if this is in yet or not, but NTs definitely need to be considered to be in-combat as soon as they cast a hostile nano.  Even if you see them, target, and hit Q, they still have time to get at least one sit & NP-kit in before you do.

Thug @ 11/18/2001 12:59:12 PM (762):
no Weapon reload works fine for my fixer/mausser.

The problem is, during reload it gets stuck in a constant state of firing. then AFTER it's reloaded it comes up and says *reloading* when really it had already reloaded.


Someone called it a continuous fire animation bug. what it really is, is a ammo reload bug. 

works though. 

Now the *take it easy* thing really sucks. i got that in about 5 missions tonight and if i hadn't had my friend in the mission with me i would have been dead.

Oh that and the mobs aggroing from all over the place. i had 1 mission where i ended up having to fight 7 mobs instead of 3, because they kept running out of adjacent rooms into the first big room.

Thug @ 11/18/2001 1:01:26 PM (740):
that's been in for a couple of patches now but i like it as well. same with the virulant minibulls attacking anyone who happens by, it helps alot with the rp aspect of the game.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:01:55 PM (650):
Well, the problem is that it's absolutely impossible to use AP or MP due to the duration.  Agent nano's only last 30 minutes, so you end up with a 15-30 min. game with no agent buffs.  No agent buffs means you have to sit there and wait 15-30 min. doing nothing until you can rebuff yourself.  It's completely impossible to fight unbuffed.

Now, if you could use agent and general nanos without penalties even under FP/AP/MP, then the AP/MP lines just *might* be considered upgrades.  Their huge skill penalties are still a barrier, though.  Make them all 30 minutes with -20 and -15 nano skill for AP & MP and you'd see agents using them.

Thug @ 11/18/2001 1:05:23 PM (702):
well i know the describe item missions work 90% of the time if you highlight them first for about 5-10 seconds, you get the reward and then can take the item. 

i've had it not work in 2-3 missions, usually when i had to zone out for some reason or another and mobs have respawned. it no longer works. 

zoning seems very bad for missions now. esp if your out at about the same time the zone respawns. once that happens a lot of times you lose out on the rewards.

Thug @ 11/18/2001 1:07:48 PM (708):
Occasionally my friend will inform me that i've just disappeared and he can no longer see me in the mission. last night it happened to both of us, i couldn't see him and he couldn't see me. 

it was a bit of an annoyance but there was only 1 mob left by the time he invisi'd on me.

i actually saw him disappear. he just sort of vanished like when a person is zoning and they fade away.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:11:52 PM (Trading out of bag deletes items 816):
If you trade an item directly out of a bag or if you take the item out of a bag and put it in inventory then trade it, you can loose the trade item (most likely) or a random equiped item.  This happens most often if the trade is declined or the item removed when the trade target doesn't see the item.  If you get into this state (target doesn't see item), the only way out is for the target to accept the seemingly empty trade and then zone.  In that case, the item will usually be present.

To prevent this bug entirely, you need to take the item out of the bag, then zone, then trade.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:14:47 PM (Inventory scrambled on zoning 819):
My main inventory is regularly scrambled on zoning.  This seems to be related to the presense of no-drop items.  The items before the no-drop are stable, but the items after it are scrambled.

To fix: bag your no-drop items, /terminate, loot your remains in the order you want them to be, unbag your no-drops and put them at the end of your inventory.  If you want your no-drops up front, sorry, not possible.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:19:59 PM (Window scrolling broken 821):
Mouse wheel scroll stops on most windows somewhere between 2/3 and 3/4 of the way to the bottom.  Normal scrolling of other types often fails completely -- eg. some windows loose the ability to be scrolled by "grabbing" the slider, can't be scrolled by clicking above/below the slider, or can't be scrolled by clicking the arrows on top/bottom.

Work-around by using one of the methods that isn't broken.  So far, I've not had all 4 methods break at once.

This scrolling bug has been in the game since beta (and was bug-reported then).  It has spread to all the other windows that can now be mouse-scrolled.

Spacegipsy @ 11/18/2001 1:20:01 PM (582):
About Missions:

There are still OT Mobs (Scooplets, Diglets, the like) in OT Missions that aggro on OT Employees. We're gonna loose our faith in Boss Ross, if this keeps going o.

XP/Token: It was supposed to be changed in one of the last patches, that *if* you get XP, you *will* also get a token. So I'd consider this to be new bug. Before this latest patch it worked fine.

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:25:46 PM (Stationary surgery clinic cost bug 822):
It states and takes 300c from you each click, but it subtracts the 300c before it checks to see if you have 300c.  So, if you have a character with, say 400c, it will steal 300c from you and then say you don't have enough cash.

Work-around: never use a clinic with less than 600c.  This bug has been around a long time (beta?  can't recall when I originally /bug'd it).

Pilker @ 11/18/2001 1:25:53 PM (Missing Maps 823):
This is nothing new in 13.0, but still...

The maps of:
-Broken Shores
-Wartorn Valley
-Wailing Wastes

All unavailable in shops.

In addition to that, Galway County has got b0rked requirements (600 for a newbie zone), and the one needed to upload is named Bay of Rome.
The same with 4Holes, you need to upload Dry Wastes to get access to the area.

It may not be a gamestopper, but it most certainly is annoying, and can't possibly be _that hard to fix?

Oh, and why do we get access to the maps of zones not yet implemented? =)

Pilker @ 11/18/2001 1:33:42 PM (740):

Thyrra @ 11/18/2001 1:48:32 PM (556):
the old mission system was by fas preferable to the 12.9 or 13.0 system.

people wanted variety.  after about 100 cave missions, caves start to get really tiring.  we got mid lvl clanners getting 80%+ missions to stret east.  i had a lvl 7 char get mission offerst to stret east, unreasonable.  

why couldn't we go back to the old system five minutes after this bomb hit RK?  there is no patch roll back mechanism in place.  fine, move forward and patch the old code back into place.  players will be more than willing to deal with some server downtime to get a bad mistake out of the live game.

people screamed about how far missions were all of a sudden.  we got missions close by, but you can't make a reasonable amount of money in a reasonable amount of time now.  this is assuming you have a life and only have an hour or two to play this game each day.  the missions are broken and they have had to spend way too much programmer time on fixing this lately, not to mention really upsetting many people.

there are some new mission maps in the game now.  i like the one where you go into a tunnel that is the inside of some worm, kind of cool.


people get tired of doing the same thing over and over and over.

please give a better mission variety.  i would like to do missions in cities beyond lvl 10.  i would like to do missions to places that are not caves.  i ran into a cool mission recently that had a really cool looking apartment area in it, and had a great garage with cars and planes and bikes in it.  i want my character to live in those rooms now.

let us choose how far away the missions will be.  
   i don't see why as level increases mission distance should ncrease too.  if i can go to the Longest Road and get a mission for Tir, why can't i get a similar mission from Tir?  is there some break down in communications on RK where mission planners/assigners/hirers only know about missions that are proportionally far away as the difficulty?  initially people will get nothing but near missions.  this will pass as they get bored.  people actually want to explore the world at times.  they have to weigh that desire against the need to get xp to get lvls to get ip to raise the right skills to get the right nano/weapon/armor/etc... 
   if i don't have enough money to equip myself properly and you force me to run missions to andromeda, i'm not going to explore, i'm going to run the safest quickest route over and over until i get the cash i need.  by this time i will probably be so fed up with going to andromeda that i won't want to explore it; not to mention that its full of aggro reds along the way.

give us a way to choose how big mission maps are. 
   as you get higher in level missions get larger.  i did a lvl 75 mission recently with a full team.  it took us a couple hours to complete it.  i did not want to do another mission afterward.  i wanted a change of pace, but could not fidn a decent place to go hunt.  i logged off.

decrease cash for closer smaller missions, that's acceptable.  don't decrease cash to the low extreme it is right now.  i got an offer for lvl 111 mission to andromed for 42k creds.  ridiculous.  a character at this level probably can't find tissue paper to clean themselves with that costs less than that.

FC, if you give us the old mission system right now, you will look like heros. 
 [ this does not mean that it is the system people want.  it does mean that it is a far preferable mission system to the current one. ]

Funcom, please read this thread. It is needing fixing, and soon. We cannot do missions with MAs !

Bjond @ 11/18/2001 1:56:20 PM (462):
The problem is that judging from player populations and the increasing number of people I don't see anymore, I'd say Funcom has lost at least 50% of the player base since it's peak.  There are no new players, either.  I often try to give away free newbie gear and don't get *any* takers.  Why?  'Cuz newbies are insanely rare.

Of the friends that have left, it's always "bugs" and "nerfs" that are the cause.  People are tired of constantly having their characters wiped out by a change or waiting patiently for patch after patch for a fix they need while Funcom states "we're working on it" and then turns around and makes rocks fly out of guns, or adds broken wheel scrolling, broken (and item eating) inventory unscrambling, and spends time tweaking the chat colors into something far less readable.

Granted all these new things would be nice if they worked, but why are they wasting time even working on them while they have things like grid camping, conceal bugged, AS bugged for months, weapon+fist  & zoning bugged since beta, pet pathing bugged since beta, surgery clinic nerfed, sugery kit bugged since beta (doesn't transfer skill), comp-lit buffs nerfed, tutoring bugged since beta (not important until clinic/comp nerfs), etc. ad nauseum.  I'm sure nearly every player could list at least one bug that they would want to see fixed before you do anything else.

The Funcom development team is running wild.  We desperately need management to step in and say, "sorry, if you put one more bug into the game, you don't get paid this month".  Then, once they fix the problem of adding new bugs, start fixing old ones.  After all that, maybe it's time to think about a new feature or two.

Funcom has one of the best FX teams I have ever seen.  The sound and graphics are marvelous.  The story (where it shows), is great.  The humor in the little things like the talking leets is sure to make anyone smile.  Please don't let a set of bad programmers drag the entire game down.

You know, some folks keep tossing around how "ground-breaking" AO is compared to EQ, UO, etc. but I'm just not seeing it.  What precisely are these "ground-breaking" features in AO?Graphics?  Graphics content is near-entirely a function of release date, since the quality of the status quo graphics cards is the restrictive element, not the ability to design content.  Even then, aside from rich, but often grotesquely corrupted textures, and some nice caustics which are entirely a function of the ongoing and predictable advance in adapters, what part of AO's graphics is "ground-breaking"?  Certainly there were other RPG/FPS games using those features before AO, just not MMORPGs -- a distinction of minimal value when discussing graphics quality.  As well, with EQ receiving a major graphics overhaul in Luclin it's entirely possible that EQ, at least, will have a graphics engine on par with AO's (and likely not suffering from the same widespread graphics corruption problems, since 989 has historically been far less tolerant of the kinds of errors Funcom has routinely "let through" into AO release).Setting?  Well, if Funcom would make more of an effort to make AO a "sci-fi" environment, there I'd agree they have a novelty.  Sadly, they will not be alone for long.  Moreover, the setting "genre" is anything but "ground-breaking", since it has been used in other online games such as Half-Life, etc.  It was hardly a ground-breaking achievement that "AO is science-fiction", simply a matter of genre selection by it's designers.  And as I've said before, for an allegedly sci-fi setting, AO seems to treat things very magically in far too many instances.Tradeskills?  Mostly do not work, and would not really differ much in relevancy, function, etc. from their counterparts on other MMORPGs if they did work.  In EQ, for example, you can also make a wide array of game-useful magic jewelry, weapons, armor, weapons, etc.  How is AO's tradeskill system, as it stands to work anytime soon, different?Magic/NFs?  AO's selection of buffs, debuffs, DDs, DOTs, pet-spells, charms, etc. seem in no way particularly "ground-breaking" compared to it's competitors.  About the only innovation is "false professions" for Agents, and even those have polymorphic equivalents in, say, EQ.Combat?  Aside from the selection of weapons and armor, many of which are pragmatically useless, and a wider selection of "special attacks" than most, AO's combat system seems little different than the others, let alone "ground-breaking"-ly different.Story?  Thus far there has been nothing presented which could be considered "ground-breaking" by most standards.  Producing new static dungeons is something ALL AO's competitors do routinely from time to time.  The same is true of "epic battles", which again do not particularly even work in AO.So what, precisely, are all these "ground-breaking" aspects of AO?

Mentioned at multitudes of times and no official answers so far.

Pisol are one of the nerfed weapons ingame, and they don´t even let us use small arms eyes. I guess that should show us how little they think of pistol issue.

Lelou @ 11/18/2001 4:43:08 PM (I "disappear" when I get in my Yalm 850):
Strangest thing!  I've noticed on more than one occasion, that when I get into my Yalm I all of a sudden can't see myself anymore.  As if I just placed my camera in the First Person position.  Except, when I press F8, it actually puts me in first person mode, press F8 again and back in third but still can't see myself.  So, I unequip my yalm, take massive amounts of fall damage, log in and out and that temporarily fixes the problem...This happened several times.  Anybody else have this same problem?

For the past two days, Radiman (yes, THE Radiman, bald head and all) has been meeting with clan leaders (yes, player guild clans) to discuss the amnesty, as was said in the first episode.
Not to mention the big cyborg attacks.

Askeladden @ 11/18/2001 5:41:26 PM (Attack?  Speed, dmg and more...... 856):
Iam having some problems with my attack , after 13.0

My atk speed has slowed down? Suddenly my char will just stop firering, he just stands there taking dmg. And he is lowering his weapong between shots? 

Burst and fling does not recycle at the correct times, burst is very slow. Fling dmg is always lower than a normal shot? 

I have noticed that i dont get any reload msg anymore? You know when trying to use a special , you would get a reload msg if the clip was empty. Not anymore.

Also, without no reason my gun will start fireing at twice the speed but i get no hits? It starts firering 6-7 shots in a row (very fast), but nothing hits? 

I get the Wait for last special atk to finish msg all the time, even when i have not used special atk?

So FC what is up with our attack, what have you done? 

Some other stuff:

Chain healers are still in game. You told us that you had removed them? Today i could not finish of 2 gray adv and a green hunter, they all healed each other over and over. But then again, if my attack would have worked i know i could have taken them. 

FC please fix my attack, i know iam not the only one with this problem, ive spoken to other players who are having the same problems as i do.

TeamEagle @ 11/18/2001 5:46:39 PM (653):
They are aware of it. (Covered in one of the 5-6 things the Eagle Team tends to petition at once.) The major problem with finding where the code breaks down is that Multi is tied into so many things.

Any Multi user can tell you it counts towards Attack Sequencing, Damage Output (both primary and secondary), Special Attacks, etc, etc, etc. Finding where the glitch is, is somewhat akin to playing a shellgame as you try to find which routine is being a pain.

Assurances were also given that it is a priority.

Xombie @ 11/18/2001 5:51:06 PM (462):
You know, some folks keep tossing around how "ground-breaking" AO is compared to EQ, UO, etc. but I'm just not seeing it. What precisely are these "ground-breaking" features in AO?
			
		
	
Social interaction
Nightclubs, bars, and other social activities provide a way for everyone to interact. Not to mention that you can talk to anyone, at any time, in any place (something that has been impossible in games like UO if your friend was on a different server shard, and in DAoC, if they choose a different ALIGNMENT, it is PROHIBITED).
I have yet to see ANY MMORPG that provided a social atmosphere above hack-and-slash gaming.

A dynamic storyline
-Radiman meeting with player guilds
-Amnesty
These are of the first two episodes. I haven't seen this much in EQ's entire history as a game.

An open-ended character design system
Want to be a banjo-tossing giant sorcerer? In AO, you can do that. Other games PROHIBIT you from adding this much personality into your characters. AO allows you to experiment with character design, where others will not even consider allowing.

These are just the things that stand out for me.


	
		
			
			
				Graphics?
			
		
	
Games that are even on par with AO's texturizing and modeling are not going to be released until mid next year.


	
		
			
			
				Setting?
			
		
	
Last time I checked, this wasn't being marketed as "the first Sci Fi game ever made". I'm not sure why you think it was.
It's said to be the first sci-fi MMORPG. Correct me if i'm wrong, but IT IS.


	
		
			
			
				Tradeskills?, Magic/NFs?, Combat?
			
		
	
When in the hell were these ever hailed as ground-breaking in AO? Last I checked, they weren't even a proposed selling point.


	
		
			
			
				Story? Thus far there has been nothing presented which could be considered "ground-breaking" by most standards.
			
		
	
"Thus far" being three weeks or so into the actual storyline. Let's count some eggs before they hatch, shall we?

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 6:37:20 PM (556):
The pre 13.0 way of doing missions although not perfect is far better than the way missioning is set up now.

When it costs more/equal (or just a small profit) the amount you need in equipment to do three missions than what you get out of the mission that is also a game stopper.  I have a few low level characters that had no problems getting decent missions with the pre 13.0 missioning system so I don't know what you are talking about there.  Although it took some time but so did it for my higher lvl chars.

I don't know how you can call it pure laziness on our part.  How can it be called laziness when the payoff is 20k for a level 60+ char to complete a mission that takes 60-120 minutes!  That's just insane.  Everyone will be doing missions instead of doing the more fun social things like group hunting or dungeon crawling and etc just to make enough credits to stay equipped.  At this point I have all my high lvl chars on hold because if you level faster than you can make money for equipment your char is just gunna plain suck.

Although the idea of a distance slider bar sounds like a great idea.

Borox @ 11/18/2001 6:42:50 PM (my carrier craft is still a submarine 862):
This is a pretty old bug, and i don't see much mentioned about it. If I get in to my carrier craft and attempt to move or turn it submerges under the pavement, and all I can see are the two tail fins sticking up out of the ground. I didn't buy it to travel around in I bought it for the + strength bonus, but it might be kind of fun to run around in it a bit. Not a major problem, but is there any eta on a fix for this?

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 6:43:34 PM (302):
As an NT myself.  I don't mind a range cap as long as we have some type of 'attainble' shields, hp and/or ac buffs.  NT can't take hits worth a darn.  Any profession 5-10 levels lower than me (I am lvl 60) can take me out in 2-4 hits.  When grouping if I get mobbed I die really fast.  NT's can dish out the damage but hitting us is like hitting a piece of soft wood.

I would be happy if I just at least saw someone with one of the new shield or ac or hp buffs that were supposedly put in one of the last patches.  The NT patch that came out has done absolutely notta for me.

I don't think it's the human MOBS, because yesterday I (an NT) was playing and I was exploring around, looking for a good place to solo hunt (no friends online  ) and I ran across a little clan outpost south of Harrys, along the river shore.  All the guys were very grey to me.  It didn't look like I was going to find anything anytime soon, and my nano was full (so my humidity extractor was doing nothing), so a nuked one of the MA mobs (they usually have the best cash reward).  
I nuked it with Glacial Advance, 288-580 cold damage.  I hit it for ~480 damage.
So either I *somehow* hit it for 960 damage, or I didn't get hit by the 50% PvP damage reduction.  I'm gonna have to go with it wasn't affected.

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 6:46:41 PM (294):
Can you create a section for answers/comments to many popular player complaints to explain that you know it is a problem?  Searching through messages for Cosmik and stuff is a little more time consuming than it should be.

My friend had to look high and low to find a general nanoformula booth that wasn't empty.  The one in the OT outpost past harrys (and north of lush resort) was empty last night, and I bet it's still empty.

It seems that the only booths that are empty with any regularity are the booths that hold what you want/need.  (how did ya program that, funcom?)

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 7:00:39 PM (647):
The reason your lvl 17 fixer has no problem is because he is lower level.  

As a NT it costs me somewhere around 5-10k (sometimes more depending on mission difficulty) for the FAs, NAs, Healing and Nano kits just to complete one mission.  

When the payoff for a lvl 57 NT is max 20k per mission and the missions take around 60-120 minutes to complete this is NOT pure laziness talking here.  This is an issue.  This means I will have to spend an enormous amount of time in missions just to keep my NT equipped, forget about doing all the fun stuff like group hunting, dungeons and etc.  

I have never had more than 900k in my bank at one time.  I don't know how you managed to amass 3.5 million at your level and still be reasonably equipped.  I checked with most of my guildates and friends who are lvl 50 or higher and all but one had never had more than 1 mill. at any given point in time.

My NT has 96 tokens at lvl 57 and compared to my friends and guildmates (50+ or higher) I have a large amount of them.  So my guess is that with your 3.5 mill and many tokens you are the exception to the rule.  Do you live in AO?

MJoverkill @ 11/18/2001 7:30:55 PM (795):
I have also noticed this, but I have only found it on Rubika2.  I have a character on each server and I have yet to see it on Rubika1.  Also, some of the vendor terminals seem to have more than their normal amount of items (specifically weapon terminals in Omni trade) and they are sorted by type.  The sorting bit is not bad but currently there is no way to get a general nano crystal in omni trade because all the terminals are empty!

Zaal @ 11/18/2001 7:37:08 PM (647):
Bump.

This issue has been happening over the last mission terminal changes since 12.8.  During 12.9 it was supposed to get fixed but 13.0 still has mission bugginess.

12.5 thru 12.7 had good mission system albeit you had to travel really far to make money but at least you good make money.  My 56 NT is stopped now from making money and leveling.  He's not badly assembled mind you.  Hell, for a nanomage NT at level 56 my hp isnt bad considering.  1000 HP (250+ hp from implants luckily - can't count how much that saves me) with body dev maxxed and its the base stats as much as the skills will let me.

He's at a point where he ahs to lower teh overall mission difficulty to get one done.

So... BUMP!

MJoverkill @ 11/18/2001 7:44:49 PM (582):
I would like to add that an old bug which was supposed to be fixed and isn't is the mob 'running on the spot and hitting you twice' bug, which is very annoying.  Funcom had stated that they had fixed this in a previous patch but alas it was not.  I only mention this because after the patch I have noticed that more mobs are getting stuck on walls or on the edges of doorways and then smacking you for 2 hits every few seconds.  Please fix this funcom

Vaavoom @ 11/18/2001 8:43:30 PM (Low Damage output-major bug-Game killer 875):
I know I'm not the only one that this happens to. I am constantly hitting mobs for only 35-45 damage. I am a level 43 MA, and what I mean is:

You have hit a <mob> for 45 points of melee damage.
You have hit a <mob> for 45 points of melee damage.
You have hit a <mob> for 45 points of melee damage.
You have hit a <mob> for 45 points of melee damage.

Now Brawl and my MA skills are not affected, but think about fighting a orange mob and this happening? With that kind of damage output who's going to win?

I'm not just talking about orange mobs, but all of them grey to red. This happens indoors or outdoors. I havnt tried it in PvP yet.

Doctorkain @ 11/18/2001 9:12:31 PM (747):
Did you stick it in a utility slot before right-clicking it to activate it? These worked for me in 12.9, but I have not tested recently.

Tiran @ 11/18/2001 9:17:37 PM (168):
What's happening is that items in bags have no weight. (As, apparently, intended).

Before 13.0, when you put something in a bag, its weight dissapeared from your load.

Now, when something enters your main inventory level, its weight is added to your load.   When you put it into a backpack, that weight is NOT removed from your load, until you zone/log.

So, when you pick up stuff, you'll want to pick up things one at a time, and backpack them immediately, before picking up another, to minimize how much weight gets added.

xbmspec @ 11/18/2001 9:24:33 PM (775):
Stragenly enough I have encountered this. Tho.. not quite like the way its happened to you. I was running around in 4-Holes when out of the blue I zoned into a open are on the edge of the world! I walked forward and there was this huge lake. Never did figure out where it took me. 

Thanks to the ARK Who pulled me out

They may not look like they are there. But they are! My friend was able to see nanos I couldnt. 

But now its fixed I think.
Anyways.. This was fixed back a few patches ago but returned and fixed agian. Dont know if thats a good sign or bad.

xbmspec @ 11/18/2001 9:29:58 PM (875):
Not all mobs have the same AC according to there color. Some in fact have more AC than most Orange Mobs (Enforcer Mobs).

So say, he has 1000 AC. You hit for 1-145 Dmg Max Being 145. 
You hit for your maximum (145) but his 1000 ac absorbs 100 Pnts of that. So 145 - 100 = 45? Basicly its on a much larger scale. Brawl does alot more Dmg so thats why its not "truely" effected.

Hope it helps

Thrin @ 11/18/2001 9:47:33 PM (875):
I have a lvl 57 NT and I used to be able to do missions with the difficulty bar a little bit to the right (more  difficult) now I after the patch I can only do missions inbetween normal and easy (major difference).  

I seem to do a heck of a lot less damage than I used to.  Before I could take a a mob of greens (2-4) and survive now a mob a one green and one grey will nearly kill me every time.  Is anyone else noticing this?

from my experience it definitely happens with some MOBS, but not all. And when I read some of the interesting posts here, I tend to conclude that indeed its an AC 'bug'? rather than something directly linked with the PvP changes.

KiaLium @ 11/18/2001 11:30:50 PM (404):
I drew a mission that had a variety of levels of Human Mobs and also was half filled with scooplets that agroed on me (Omni, so this isn't fixed either) and have the following to report.

On all Human mobs Grey through Dark Orange I was hitting for minimum damage with my fists (67 pts) and Sword (39 pts). However against yellow and orange scooplets I was hitting from 109 to 219 with fists.

My Brawls and special attacks worked as usual, but far fewer crits than normal.

Hope this info helps,

When I invite, they get the "do you want to join...", they press yes, and then nothing....

If I promote, "you have been promoted to member", but if you take info on that person he/she is still applicant. If you promote again, same msg.

Ideas anyone?

Sumonia @ 11/19/2001 1:38:29 AM (404):
Spydr, i think you missed the point entirely. 

The bug is only (so far) been in MISSIONS on humanoid mobs. Try doing a mission, with humanoid enemies. See if they resist your spells more... 

I dont think it has anything to do with the restriction on pvp coming over into normal play....but i do know this is a big bug as you can see it has effected many people. 

I even noticed it with my newbie lv 20 enf when i was farmin tokens today. One mob, i would hit for 50-60 a hit (duel wield baseball bats) and then one mob (same colour as before) max i could hit for was 2 pts (QL 50 bats) LMAO

But recently I have finding mobs that regenerate AND heal at a crazy rates. It takes forever to finish one off. I don't mind a challange, but if I want a real challange I will find a Bloodcreeper or Hammer. I am only lvl31... cannot hit the big boys yet.

I've fallen into the not-zones between Tir and Greater Tir (as well as other locations) since oh, maybe 12.4 ? It is an old bug. The solution is to turn around and run 'til you hit the zone again. You'll be fine. I /terminated a character out of a no-zone once and that worked too, but its hardly the best idea. I just didn't know what it was at the time.

TheDarkOne @ 11/19/2001 3:02:46 AM (901):
I wish these messages would stay at the top.  This is the third one.  The server patch after 13.0 broke the whole org system.  Looks like we have to wait for who knows how long for them to fix the orgs, and even then there's a chance they'll break it even more.

Aggelikki @ 11/19/2001 3:18:56 AM (Flurry of blows 920):
I'm using a pair of executioners and I often use flurry of blows to speed up my attack.  But after I finish using it, my melee initiatives sometimes decrease lower than my original value.  And I'll attack very very slowly from now on.  I've to zone in order to have everything back to normal.  I use flurry of blows quite often but I can't conclude when this strange thing will happen.  It looks to me that it occurs in random.  Does anyone have the same situation as me?

Another thing about flurry of blow, but less annoying, is that I have to activate the flurry of blow before a combat.  If I activate it in the middle of the combat, it doesn't seem to speed up my attack, although my melee initiatives do increases when I look at my skill menu.

XtroXtreme @ 11/19/2001 4:03:42 AM (856):

Bloodriegn @ 11/19/2001 4:58:21 AM (Chain Healing and Minimum Damage 925):
Ok, just did a few missions with NPC mobs.  My problem is generally with 2 types healing types and fighter types.

My character is a lvl 60 enforcer using a lvl 79 merchant blade...for reference.

NPC soldier cons green yellow to me one click below even.  I hit every hit except for brawl for 9-17 points my normal average is 80-180 pts.  Soldiers reflect shields hits me every hit for about 8pts average, everyhit.   This guy took, and I timed it 4 minutes to kill.   To me thats a bit excessive.

This same thing happens with many other fighter types, I have no idea if they just have insanely high ACs or what but when this happens with a healer.  Foget it, and forget the mission....I cant win even zoning 5 or 6 times.

Now for Chain healers, every ark and gm I talked to in game said they arent there.  Emails I sent to bugs, well didnt say anything   But I'll be damned if I dont run into at least 2 or 3 every mission with NPC Mobs.  They are of course incredibly hard to kill if not impossible if they also only let you hit for minimum damage.   So to you at Funcom that say they arent there anymore I say B.S. just /tell me in game and I'll show ya plenty!

Anyhow I am sure I cant be the only one having this problem so if you do please tell em

Thanks

Brad, STL/MO @ 11/19/2001 5:18:34 AM (Yet Another Way for Missions to Break 928):
Doesn't it figure. Just when you thought the "mission" bugs couldn't get any weirder, Funcom grows weirder bugs.

After the patch on the 18th, I was running a "go get me that one" mission. It said I was supposed to bring back the Superior Nanoclusters from such-and-such a location.

I cleared out the dungeon, a tiny little one, one of those worm-gut ones. When I get to the worm's colon, there's my mission objective: a Superior Nanocluster sales terminal.

Needless to say, it wouldn't let me pick it up and take it home.

I petitioned twice on this, but no ARKs showed up to see it.

 - - - - -

On a related note, I can confirm what others have said -- the "go observe this object" missions can be completed by single-clicking the object, at least some of the time. It'd be prudent, until you hear this bug is fixed, to always try that first.

Being an old retired code-monkey, I'll bet I even know how this happened. This is how you're supposed to work the "go observe this mob" missions -- which you'll notice don't always work, either. Want to bet that two chunks of code got swapped around?

Too bad you can't pick up mobs; but until they fix it you can at least select object containers on the ground and finish those missions.

I deeply love the idea of a science fiction, not fantasy, MMORPG. You couldn't pay me to play Everquest or Dark Age of Camelot. But when it comes to ship it, then fix it, boy in some ways Funcom makes Microsoft look good.

Heh. I got thrown into the very edge of Greater Tir County today while running in Tir. I just terminated because i'm lazy.

Vaavoom @ 11/19/2001 6:09:31 AM (404):
I talked to an ARK today, it seems that enforcers and a fixer he saw have the same problem. I sent Funcom a letter, and a screenshot of me doing 45's on a grey mob. They claim they didnt know there was a problem, but it seems the ARKs do.

Hinesbra @ 11/19/2001 6:49:25 AM (856):
yeah my enf has a melee init of 300 and he just sits too, wont attack even when attack bars are full. It is wierd now the monsters attack soooo fast and are green while I attack so slow

Gurthang @ 11/19/2001 6:54:27 AM (Don't get experience points while soloing in FFA camps. 932):
I reciently noticed that many times when I go to lets say the "bothackers camp" in plesent medows @ 800 x 800. where there seems to be a never ending free for all combat in that camp.  Many times I will not get any experience points for the damage I have done.

The situations when it occurs all the time:
1. Mobs where it is already aggroed on someone else.
2. When I have attacked first, gotten the aggro but someone steals the aggro from me.

The situations when I sometimes get xps:
1. When I manage to get the first hit and keep the aggro the entire time but am not the only attacker.

And of course I always get the xps if I kill it completely myself.

The only reason I mention this is that this xps awarding method  seems completely differient from how it is done when I am teamed where if any member pops a monster even once the xps are given to the team in proportion to the damage done. And killing it or getting aggro seems to have no berring on the xp reward.

I seem to remember a long time ago that changes were made to how xp was rewarded and I was wondering if this is a bug or as designed.

Bump

Matsui @ 11/19/2001 7:42:25 AM (920):
I have experienced the same problem. It's really frustrating that melee init drops to close zero. I have 157 melee init and after flurry i have 307 and after flurry wears off i have 7 as melee init. And that's not good at all if i have few mobs on me.

I have noticed that if there are 2 attackers and i hit first one so that the other agroes after my first hit. When I activate flurry with first mob, it starts to works on the second mob, my melee init is increased. But not for the first mob.

Thyrra @ 11/19/2001 8:35:44 AM (920):
yup, flurry of blows is bugged.

it seems that your attack speed is calculated at the beginning of the fight, that way your lvl relative to opponents lvl can adjust your speeds.  this means that anything u do to affect this, after the fight has started and that calculation has been made, will not change things.  if the modified init is in effect when your next fight starts, it will take effect.

FC would have to code the flurry of blows so that it makes the game recalculate relative attack speeds in order for the effect to take place when using the item and already in a fight.

---

on lowering the inits:  i suffered a strange thing after 13.0 patch.  my inits all got debuffed and my run speed got buffed by about 500.  this was kind of cool.  it wore off as soon as i zoned.  not sure if it is connected to the flurry of blows.

WGMelchior @ 11/19/2001 9:11:44 AM (928):
From my own experience of the latest mission fix, observe/pickup item missions works as they should. They are also the ones with the best reward (2 items and max cash) so I don't see why people should run around doing the other ones.

Aggelikki @ 11/19/2001 9:12:32 AM (920):
I have the same problem even fighting with just 1 mob, not only fighting with a few mobs.  I really want to know what's exactly causing this problem, so that I can avoid it.

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 9:15:40 AM (759):
I want to pose a 'simple' question:

You are living in your house/doing your job in a building. Somebody invades it (maybe a thief, maybe a murder). You defend yourself and the intruder is obviously on the loosing side - he/she flees. Why wouldn't you take a step out of the door and finish him/her off while he/she sits quite in front of the door trying to bandage him/herself.
And why on Rubi-Ka shouldn't you be able to use the same healing mechanisms in the same ammount of time than the intruder?

Got the point?

You can 'zone' to save your butt, which is a design flaw by itself (but technically unavoidable). So, I guess, this is the answer by Funcom (who, interestingly, are responsible for the design flaw ...). And btw., I always used this technique to survive the first room.

As it seems, the game gets more and more combat oriented. 

So long,

Max(imilian)

Theanna @ 11/19/2001 9:37:42 AM (759):
The issue is not as to whether or not they are allowed to heal themselves, but the fact that they regen faster than we can heal ourselves.  It's absolutely ridiculous to have a green mob regenerating faster than you can damage it... I had one that I would crit for about 300, and then go to 16 damage for 20 shots or so.. by the time I got another crit, it was almost at full health again! No heals cast, no FA kit flashes, nothing.  I wish *I* could regenerate that fast.

Theanna

Theanna @ 11/19/2001 9:41:23 AM (775):
you can't always rezone in.  I wandered around in the between-zones around newland desert for a while trying to find my way back in... wandered alla way to the edge of the world.  (The ancients were right... the world *IS* flat, and if you go too far, you might fall off!)  Tried going back, and I couldn't get past the edge of the zone.   But it *WAS* entertaining to watch rhinos fall from the sky. 


Theanna

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 10:00:14 AM (Bug List 943):
Could we somehow focus the bug reports? I'll give it a try, feal free to add your observations:

- Offhand weapon (pistol) unequipping each time you zone, although requirements are met. This even occurs after starting AO.
- NPCs nuke through several rooms/walls - without any line of sight.
- Specials are not always properly registered as performed (same forum: "wait for your previous attack to complete" 
- Once detected in leet (sneaking) form the NPCs wait for minutes (15+) in the start room always detecting you upon entering. -> Sneaking impossible . They return to their rooms faster, if you are not in leet form when leaving the mission area. I consider this a a major nerf, that renders a whole part of my character useless.
- Executing of nano formulas completly blocked while morphed into reet (Forum 'Test Server Bugs': Reet form bugged on live
- Leaving the advanced shop (in Borealis) causes reshuffle of the inventory.
- Self-targeting (F1) is not working entirely correct. You sit down, heal yourself, loot the corpse and are 'untargeted' although the target that is shown (upper left corner) are still yourself. Only way to solve this is changing the camera view and target 'manually' with the mouse (rather annoying).
- The Newland map is still not working.
- A map for the Wailing Wastes? (Missions to this playfield are quite common these days  )
- Spamming message in the Grid (~10 times) ' Your Computer literature has to be xxx to use this ...' - it is high enough.
- Clan NPCs attacking neutral players? - happened once
- The 'energy beam' weapon animation for the desert reet obviously does not start from the weapon, but from the 0/0 corner of the playfield your are in. -> Moments after the fight is over, energy beams start hitting the dead target. Funny and performance killing.
- (To) high regenaration rate for MOBs/NPCs in mission areas.
- Doors do not open any more after lockpicking them.

Far from being complete and byassed by my character's view. But a start. I tried to sort the 'bugs' in a somewhat objective manner (more general to profession specific, more important to minor).

So long,

Max(imilian)

Sumonia @ 11/19/2001 10:03:10 AM (404):
They only need to look here and they will see just how many people it has effected that are reporting it on the forums. Im sure there are loads of people who are either plodding on with the bug, dying and getting serious depressed and others who can play different chars hoping that it gets reported and fixes  

Glad more people are emailing them, hopefully they will get the idea soon.....*waiting on a very much needed fix*

Sumonia @ 11/19/2001 10:09:58 AM (211):

As design flaw? Well.. like u said. The 1st gang bang room is a design flaw too. 

How are we to survive the fight alone.... when we can't even hope to be able to zone out.. recover and come back to complete the fight ?

Team up and do the missions ? Aren't we supposed to be able to solo in this game ?

It is now no joke even when fighting GREEN mobs. 

U go try it .. face 3 of them at a go.

They REGEN hitpoints even DURING THE FIGHT at a crazy rate.

They REGEN hitpoints even faster after we zone out to heal up.

I can understand if non-healing clases (who had to use only treament packs) comes back to find them fully healed. 

But I'm an ADV. I use my healing NF + Treatment kits to recharge my hitpoints. And that is a VERY short time. And I have A LOT LESS hitpoints than those mobs.

But by the time I zone back.. those mobs have fully recovered as well.

Simply said.. FUNCOM CHEATS. I don't care about the stupid excuse of mobs being stupid in AI.

There is no intelligence involved in the gang bang room of almost every mission. It's a do or die fight.

It is now almost impossible to win those fights unless u have some UBER alpha strike capability.

It gets worse if the mobs is the Anun or Life Bleeder types... try taking on 2 Greens.. I hope u can survive.

Or if the mobs are heavily armored NPC soldier types.

Creep @ 11/19/2001 10:18:30 AM (Omni med-suits not giving treatment 944):
Sorry if this has been posted before.

Certain components of the omni med-suit are not giving any treatment or first-aid bonus.  For example, the male shirt gives full 20/20, but the female skirt doesn't give anything.

Oh, and the in-game bug report form reset my PC when it tried to get back into the game!

Creep.

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 10:20:41 AM (759):
that we are in the middle of a balancing process (done on the live servers and not on test!).

-> Theanna: I agree, that the regenaration rate is to high.

I made some strange observations this weekend (Max, lvl45 neutral Adventurer, dual pistol wielder): Although I had the impression that my damage output 'seemed' to be reduced, the fights were shorter.
My suggestion: They reduced the hit points of the MOBs and added a higher regeneration rate. Another possibility: they reduced the (radiation) AC of most of the NPCs.
To compensate for my low damage output, I overequipped as far as I could (first time of my character's life). I had a ql67 Khemo Tech in my Bank account (bought for later), but after calculating the numbers it seemed possible to wield it. I buffed all that I could (including base characteristics) and finally was able to put it on. So now I have a pistol that is 22 levels beyond my own in my leading hand and a ql51 Desert Reet as offhand gun. Equipped in such a way, I was starting to deal nice damage (for this type of damage dealer). Quite often I do 100+ damage with the Khemo Tech. Right now I could handle (light) oranges with acceptable risk (detected by accident - I was attacked by one without the chance to run ...). All together I had the impression, that my combat performance was boosted. BUT, majorly due to overequipping (although legally).
Sneaking missions is (almost) impossible right now, which I find rather pity (maybe enough reason to quit).

So, let's hope, the balancing is proceeding fast. Open for discussion.

So long,

Max(imilian)

MORB @ 11/19/2001 10:29:51 AM (943):
For the multimelee unequip problem, I use two 1h edged and don't have any unequip problem when I zone.

 - reet polymorph disappearing when I zone. I read somewhere that it doesn't work when reeting someone else, but I suppose it's supposed to work when I turn myself into a reet. And I can zone in leet form.

Since I don't have enough bio metamorph without some implants, I suppose that when the requirements are checked for the polymorph when you zone, implants are not properly accounted.

I don't have weapon unequiping problem though. Maybe it's the same bug and if you rely on implants to use them, the off-hand weapon de-equip...

Ashuras @ 11/19/2001 10:35:28 AM (759):
I forgot to mention... I was level 76 ADV, wielding a QL99 DReet on one hand, and a QL80+ ETE on the other.

Where I could hope for Crits and win close fight... (I've equiped LLTS), now they've nerfed that as well.... so ... no more relying on crits. (I could get one crit per fight prior to nerf... now... hardly any).

Why Funcom... why do u have to nerf here, nerf there.... are we players doing TOO WELL ?

FYI, My pistol wielding ADV could only do < 50% missions solo.... 

Now those < 50% missions give me GREY mobs all the time.

50% missions occasionally gives me ORANGE mobs who blocks my way --> Delete Mission.

Or gives me a gang bang room with a few yellow mobs --> Delete mission.

Sigh...

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 10:47:38 AM (759):
Ashuras, I am on your side (I 'try' to play the game).

Due to my rather low level I am not affected by some of the problems (not yet), although I fear the time beyond lvl 50.
Right now it is mostly like this:
MOBs dealing minimum damage of 40+ - I wish I would do an average of that. My offhand Desert Reet starts dropping in efficiency (damage range 6-20 most often). Finding these guns in the few neutral shops is hilarious. And so on.
But I could kill oranges this weekend for ~2k xp per kill - great imbalance!

Btw. I forgot the fact of the broader level range of MOBs in missions - have to put this in my bug thread.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 11:30:43 AM (943):
- The broader level range in MOBs/NPCs in missions. This leads to 'even' missions that can't be solved (the dark orange killier MOB, that you can't win against). Before 13.0 I knew, that in a 1.1 mission there would not be a single grey. I 'felt' it balanced. Right now, missions of this and higher diffculty very often contain greens and to some extend greys??? I assume this will be a major problem for the acquisition of tokens (I am neutral, so I don't know).

-> MORB:
- Uneqipping: Yup, I guess as well, it is a problem with some 'additive' factors like implants. Maybe Funcom even introduced this one to kill the overequipped implants (vicious speculation). But that really hits the 'normal' players. I, for myself, am wearing a complete set of ql50 implants at lvl 45. This set did cost me ~500k, two weeks of planning and shopping and a very friendly NT to assemble them. I didn't need no tricks to install them, just the +20 treatment and a +12 stamina buff. My performance really relies on these 'guys'. Funcom even encouraged using implants (in the earlier days). So why are they not able to introduce new functions without killing some existing? It worked before 12.9, for sure. Btw. with the same set of implants (see how slow I level).
- Sparrow Flight Other: Last time I tested it was still bugged. The nano takes off at zoning, but you are still morphed (with all restrictions). You have to zone again to remove the morph completly.
By now I am able to execute Sparrow Flight Other and SF Team without buffing, so I would try it again, but do you think someone wants to be morphed right now ... ?
As I understood those two formulas, they are supposed to be executed on others that do not have to meet the requirements - otherways it wouldn't make any sense, or? So, if I (the caster) meet the requirements, the nano should persist (outdoor).

-> Broken

So long,

Max(imilian)

Ashuras @ 11/19/2001 11:46:13 AM (943):
Could u add that ADV Reflect shields no longer reflects damage of DOTs ?

It was not mentioned in the list of intended changes. SO I hope this is a bug and NOT A NERF.

OmniEnf @ 11/19/2001 12:35:10 PM (707):
This happened to me too.

Just attack the creature and start running away.
Wait till you get a "Attacked by -NONE-" message.
Then stop and try to fight the mob

The client won't let you attack. Even your special attacks won't work.

The only fix seems to be either to zone or to log off.

This is especially annoying for tanks who have to do pulling duty. Try explaining to the group why you just pulled a mob and can now do nothing while the doc is getting trashed.

n0th1ng @ 11/19/2001 12:46:49 PM (725):
This happens when you try to leave Backyards as well, even if im lv 36

Losonos @ 11/19/2001 12:55:13 PM (Bug List 13.0 959):
Synch Bugs abound --- Often when rooting and/or sleeping an NPC it's posistion will be incorrectly reporting, this is magnified by chain rooting, you can see this most visibly when someone has an aggro monster sitting right next to them but it's not able to attack. Typically 2 seconds of monster movement will fix this but in that time someone else could be getting ghost hits and dying.

Ghost Hits (Linked to Synch Bug) -- Often when your darting in/out of a monster's combat range (i.e. when he stops to do a melee attack) if you are actually struck you will see no damage. This damage will be applied when the client does something that checks your HP, such as using a first aid kit/treatment lab, or taking another hit(Which is also when the ghost hits will be applied).

Attack nano fumbles are up -- Seems to be a major complaint and i'm noticing several fumbles per fight, I doubt guns "jam" this often 

Nano resists are out of whack -- 7 resists in a row against a grey with me having quite high MC... (Lesser Anun Something), 5 resists in a row against a low green mutant (Never had em resist before, it was a TAC I believe). Why should a grey monster have over 700 nano resist when i'm still capped at 400 because of the level 100 cap? 

Take it easy -- In heavy combat conditions with multiple targets immediately retargeting and attacking will cause this to occur. 

Ghost Nanos -- Nanos not doing anything appear to be back, i've had quite a few go into nothingness, no resist message, etc.

Sleep Nanos -- Still require 2 damage hits to bring these out of sleep, 1st hit will cause it to re-aggro, but it will go back to sleep, allowing a free hit. (Note: It may smack you once and if you attack with your gun then this nullifies that)

Recharge Bug #1 -- Sometimes when targeting around you will be unable to recharge until you eliminate all your targets and target yourself.

Recharge Bug #2 -- Sometimes after combat (or after you sleep an NPC to get rid of aggro) you can't recharge at all until the client seems to synch up with the server (I've noticed that this fixes itself after my attack bars start going up/down even though i'm not fighting). This applies to looting as well (The Please Wait... loot bug)

Looting Bugs -- See Recharge Bug #2 and the Synch Bug (Dead bodies can be misreported too, especially if they are running when you kill them)

Lazz @ 11/19/2001 1:03:07 PM (707):
cman & Omnienf, you're correct. This is a major problem when pulling. I've had it numerous times.

Anarchin @ 11/19/2001 1:15:05 PM (707):
The work-around for this bug is to target and attack yourself or a teammate. You will get a message about not being able to attack. Then select the mob you wish to kill.

Cern @ 11/19/2001 1:15:57 PM (Some MP bugs that REAPPEARED after 13.0 961):
These bugs were addressed in 12.6 or 12.8 and were working properly after that patch.  However, they came back with the introduction on 13.0.

Could someone officially comment on these pls:

I believe all these bugs to be related:

Once again guards in PvP areas attack our pets, so no PvP except arena fighting for MP's.

When you attempt to tab select enemies, you must first cycle thru your pets

If you attempt to buff your pet in a 25% zone you get the message "cannot run programs on members of the opposing side of conflict"

I think we can al assume this was caused again by the new PvP code:  something was done to insure that pets only did 50% damage in pvp also.  However, unless this is corrected MP's really cannot PvP.  Pls address this issue again Funcom.

And as a reminder   There are still other pet issues to be resolved.

i.e. losing control of Heal pet is it's target dies.  (serious bug here Funcom)  perhaps even more important than the PvP issues

Cern

Baxie @ 11/19/2001 1:19:18 PM (Missions too tough, forced to blitz. Looks like I'll be bankrupt soon! 963):
I play a Fixer. 

lvl 57 and only 75 or so equipment.

I got 1500/1300/1400 AC and 1500 HP

I Blitz most of my missions, since I have been unable to do a mission in less than 3 hours and after having to Zone more than 50 times on 50% or thereabouts missions. 

I have written down the "statss" on a 50% mission I did once in Clon****: 

Mission objective: Find and describe item (Item was a QL 39 Match Pistol) 
Total traveltime to get to the mission area: 43 minutes 
Total time for the mission: 4 hours 27 minutes 
Number of Yellow mobs: 7 
Number of Greens: 23 
Number of Greys: 18 
Number of Healers: 6 (Two in the same room: Took 33 minutes and 6 zones to kill them) 
Number of deaths: 4 
Number of zones (For healing): 59 times. 
Highest Crit: 423 
Highest Burst: 520 
Mission reward: 
QL 54 Titan Plasteel Armor Sleeves, 16323 credits (No token inspite that I cleared the whole dungeon, this might have to do with the fact that I was doing greys) 

At this time I was lvl 54 myself and carried around armor not less than QL 67 and using a QL 77 Mausser. 

I wrote all of this down for fun, but since then I have not done a solomission above 30% in the right "way"

Why would I?

Now I blitz for cash and hunt for XP.

Tokens you ask? Ha, I got the same chance of getting a token as I do of sprouting wings and flying off into the sunset.

So now I blitz and this is somewhat how it goes:

Mission Terminal. 20 mins or so to get 3 missions in the same area.
(Rewards: Greater Omni Forest: 6K Lush Fields: 10K Stret East Bank 20K Clon****: 24K All missions where at the mission terminal at the plateau in Ent at around 70% for me at lvl 57)

Three missions in Clon****.

I get down there.

I start my runs:

First Dungeon: Quite simple: Enemies are Orange to Red Clan Crats, NTs and Fixers. I watch out for the Roots stay pretty much clear of any serious damage. I find my item, pick it up and bolt out of there.

Second Dungeon: Very Annoying. Enemies: Scooplets and Diglets of an Unknown difficulty as I can't target them. I run like hell, gets cought in the Edge Bug and dies from the 15 or so OT issue Scooplets and Diglets that I have been told shouldn't be there. They hit for like 150 or so each time and I am a sitting duck coz I am stuck.
Two tries reveals that there is no way in hell I will be able to complete this mission.

Third mission: Very annoying. Enemies: Red Tac 88 runaways with an incredible runspeed. I have a runspeed of about 550 without my vehicle and these guys were on me like flies on.... cake. I survive for about 30 secs in which time I have aggroed 3 Tacs that hit me for about 200 Chem dam a pop.

Now for the all finishing touch:

One weekends worth of work:
More than 30 missions taken:
12 Completed rest abandoned
Income: 260K
Total value of items: about 60K (Incredible amount of clothes and tools such as Mission dupers and other worthless stuff.)

Prepatch 12.8 I could blitz missions for 260K in less than 2 hours. I had tonnes of locations to choose from. And I actually got stuff that I or others could use.

So now I ask what  logic lies behind this. 

320K will get me maybe one piece of bodyarmor that i can use and new healing kits.

All i can say is Poor docs. I am glad I don't rely that much on Nano. Must suck to have to play an entire weekend at 20% missions to afford nanokits.

Can we get a statement on this?

Is this really how its supposed to work?

Maximilian @ 11/19/2001 1:22:05 PM (725):
Confirmed (every time you want to leave the Grid via a node), but to my knowledge does not stop you from zoning.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Klattu @ 11/19/2001 1:34:05 PM (823):
I would like to thank for Iam finally able to show my Newland Desert map. It took an age but after fourth uplad and 13.0 patch it display.

Tnite @ 11/19/2001 2:33:19 PM (920):
I have reported this problem to funcom in the last two weeks.  They said they are working on it.  It seems that lag is the cause of the problem.  If the server and your computer are out of syc at the time your flurry turns on or shuts off it can cause you to either get stuck at a lower speed or as happens to me a lot stuck at the full speed of the flurry of blows.  Now what you night not have noticed if you always zone to get rid of the affect is that it can be done again.  Thats right you can go from 367 to 167 then five minutes later go down to -67.  Its happened to me a few times in really bad areas where the fights were so fast with 50 other people that I didn't now I was knocked down till a long fight came along.  Works the up way to, I have had my speed go over 1000 because of this.  Also happens with parry shield but not as often.  
Eventually they will get it right, for now its just a silly bug.

biggfoo @ 11/19/2001 2:36:03 PM (920):
Just think of it that you just became really tired from hitting faster.

Hrmm I wonder if I could get paid to come up with reponses like that....

Guadoc @ 11/19/2001 2:36:35 PM (943):
One from me, since the latest patch I can't hit some mobs in missions for more than 10pts of dmg. I'm a 35 Enforcer dual-wielding QL50 Stun Batons and it took me 4 hours of playing 1 mission before I had to enlist the help of a 60MA to come and help me (amusingly this mission had a reward of 2500 credits and 1 piece of armour  ).

I can hit them fine if I cast Brave Challenger to Cyclops but as that only lasts 1 minute and blocks nano for 2 minutes after, it means that I have to pull the mob to the front entrance and zone in and out to have any chance of defeating it.

I'm beginning to suspect that the mobs have had their AC ramped up again - but it seems a bit stupid that I can't hit yellows (supposed to be my level) for anything more than min. dmg with weapons 15 QLs above me.

BTW, I have noticed that the mobs that this is most likely to happen with is human NPCs - related to the PvP changes?


Guadoc

Tnite @ 11/19/2001 2:38:02 PM (932):
actually you've already answered the question.  In a team you can get exp for only doing a tiny bit of damage.  As a solo you would have to do at least half of the damage to garantee that you get the exp.  If you are keeping aggro that means you are the hardest hitting person(doing most damage) which is why you get exp.  Best bet get at least one friend to team with you and hunt to your hearts content.

MORB @ 11/19/2001 2:39:17 PM (211):
It's definately a big problem.
It's my main problem with missions in 13.0, even before yesterday's patch. At least, you could avoid mission types that doesn't work...
But now to be able to complete a mission, you have to insanely reduce the difficulty, thus having only grey and greens... Or blitz them, but completing an easy mission, with all the loot gives me more money (I'm level 29 currently)
And even like this, I got my ass handed to me on a plate by a green mob yesterday...

Guadoc @ 11/19/2001 2:44:40 PM (211):
Me too. I'm dual-wielding with 1hb Stun Batons 15 QL above my level and I can't hit green human NPCs for more than 10pts of damage unless I use Challenger (ups your attack skills).

I have noticed though that another enf. friend with a hammer the same QL level as my stun batons was hitting them for about 3-400 at a time. 

Maybe this is mainly affecting weapons with low maximum damage - related to AC?


Guadoc

Tnite @ 11/19/2001 2:51:20 PM (875):
I will answer the original person question since I have seen this a lot.  my best friend plays a lvl 114 MA and his consistent damage is 102 now.  It used to be 70 but with each lvl he raises MA skill and it gets a point or two higher.  What seems to be happening is if your initiative (physical in the case of an MA) is not high enough to compensate for the MOBs evades then you can only get min damage.  Now in the case of MA's who have high min damage  this isn't so bad you are doing better than most people would in the same situation.  If you want to see this for yourself attack something lower than you, waaay lower and watch the damage. Insane right its becuase your initiative has given you the highest range of your attack or a crit.  I dual wield ql 118 riders my sword is from 6-296 but this actually means my min damage is only 45 but my high damage is like 400 crits are 850.  I can hit the same mob as my friend and while he rattles of 102 every hit I can only do 45 and maybe a 200 every 5 hits.  Your great min damage makes a big difference.

Dudicas @ 11/19/2001 3:12:47 PM (Carbonrich rock? 976):
Okay, does this stuff really exist?  Am I just a moron that doesn't know where to find it?

I spent over an hour last night trying to find someone who either had or could make a prepared program crystal for me.  I wasted 22k on the nanoprogramming components to create a programmed photon emitter all because nobody has any carbonrich rock to turn into carbonrich ore to turn into pure carbon crystal to turn into a prepared program crystal.

Is the nanoprogramming still broken because of this?  Funcom keeps putting new tradeskills in, but not paying attention to the ones that are supposedly working.  I know atleast at one point the stuff was spawning because there were a few people that told me they had seen it, but didn't know where or on what mob it dropped on.

Either put this stuff in the shops, or tell us where to find it or something Funcom.  The rest of the nanoprogramming seems to be working marvelously, but if we can't get the raw materials then we can't be expected to make anything.

realitymark @ 11/19/2001 3:29:19 PM (bug concerned with melee damage 982):
Recently, every other fight that i am in I only seem to do minimum damage. It pisses me off quite a bit since I am a lvl 28 MA and usually I do about 50-80 damage with a single melee punch. BUt because of this annoying bug, I only seem to do minimum damage every second fight that i am in. Here are a couple of screenshots:

Nightclubs, bars, and other social activities provide a way for everyone to interact. Not to mention that you can talk to anyone, at any time, in any place (something that has been impossible in games like UO if your friend was on a different server shard, and in DAoC, if they choose a different ALIGNMENT, it is PROHIBITED).
I have yet to see ANY MMORPG that provided a social atmosphere above hack-and-slash gaming.
			
		
	
Huh?  Did you even try this before you made your comment?  Players cannot message between servers in AO any more than they can message between shards (which are the same thing - servers) in UO.  Same restrictions apply to both games, so how is AO "better"?

As for "nightclubs", there are taverns, and similar gathering places in ALL of the MMORPGs currently released.  People are as capable of the same levels of social interaction in, say, EQ, as they are in AO.  Both have animated emotes, both have social gathering places, etc.  How is AO "better" in that regard either?  Just because more players use it (often because they have nothing else to do), does not mean the systems available in other games are any better or worse.  For the most part, they're largely the same in terms of capabilities.

As for the DAoC restrictions on communications, Funcom would be well-advised to actually learn a bit from Mythic on that issue.  Right now, nothing prevents a player from creating a "spy" character on the same server (but opposide "side") as where they play their "main" character.  That is going to be exploited, without question, once the sides start planning big group attacks, etc.  DAoC's approach is far less exploitable in that regard.  Frankly, the ability to create chars on both sides of a conflict on the same server is a design flaw which Funcom will eventually be forced to fix.  Restricting communications and character-generation to same sides on a given server makes it far more feasible to do large player-run events, without griefers deliberately ruining it.
	
		
			
			
				A dynamic storyline
-Radiman meeting with player guilds
-Amnesty
These are of the first two episodes. I haven't seen this much in EQ's entire history as a game.
			
		
	
Yeah, let's discuss the "amnesty" a second.  Whoops, there went any ability for Omni players to believe there was an actual conflict underway.  Cities filled with roaming Clanners is NOT what we were promised on the box.  All in the name of "balancing" because Clanners were complaining about high prices and inability to get certain items -- so Funcom made it possible for them to get to Omni stores easily, as a fix.  

Where's the story in that?  Do you have any clue how "un-immersive" and implausible such a one-sided amnesty is, while Clan city guards still openly chase and kill Omni citizens?  If that is an example of the kind of "in-game story" we can expect, then this "story" is losing plausibility by the second.

As for the "dynamic storyline", you are aware that the "major characters" in EQ often act as shepherds/actors in in-game GM-run events just to add "story" right?  Frankly, I'd say any of the big GM-run story events on EQ servers remain unparalleled by any of the story attempts on AO to date.  So how is AO "better", let alone "ground-breaking", in that regard?
	
		
			
			
				An open-ended character design system
Want to be a banjo-tossing giant sorcerer? In AO, you can do that. Other games PROHIBIT you from adding this much personality into your characters. AO allows you to experiment with character design, where others will not even consider allowing.
			
		
	
Sorry, but this statement is flat-out untrue.  Both UO and AC allow far greater "class-independent" character development of skills than AO.  Want to fight using pets?  Anyone can train the skills necessary to do that in UO.  Want to be a full-out "Tank Mage"?  Either AC or UO allows far more plausible magic access to any character through appropriate training, as opposed to restricting spell access by "character class".  

Even in EQ, aside from weapons and armor restrictions which are plausibly tied to class (druid-type blade restrictions, metal armor being damaging to Iksar), the various weapons and armor types are equally trainable to characters depending on where they choose to spend their training points.  None of this semi-ridiculous "I can't mathematically ever be good at <skill> because it requires too many dark blue skills for my class".  Even in EQ, there are "general spells" which become available to multiple "classes" at different levels.

How, precisely, does AO allow "more free-form development" than UO or AC, or even for that matter EQ?  Your "banjo-tossing giant sorcerer" example is as doable in those games as it is in AO.
	
		
			
			
				These are just the things that stand out for me.
			
		
	
Except that the things which stood out for you are no less true in other games as they are in AO.  "Ground-breaking" just doesn't seem to apply to AO in any of those situations/mechanics.
	
		
			
			
				Games that are even on par with AO's texturizing and modeling are not going to be released until mid next year.
			
		
	
Shadows of Luclin's character class models are all on-par, poly-count-wise, with AO's, and will be shipping in less than a month.  For the new areas (Luclin), the textures are on-par with AO as well.  While the older areas have improved textures too, they will not be upgraded up to "AO specs", true, but that's largely an issue of "client-compatibility" (the need to run older EQ clients).  Areas which require SoL have textures as nice, and mob models as nice and detailed, as anything in AO.
	
		
			
			
				Last time I checked, this wasn't being marketed as "the first Sci Fi game ever made". I'm not sure why you think it was.
It's said to be the first sci-fi MMORPG. Correct me if i'm wrong, but IT IS.
			
		
	
Actually, I was simply responding ahead of time to the notion that the "sci-fi" concept was "groundbreaking", as it isn't from a games sense.  The issue under discussion was what parts of AO were "ground-breaking", and just being a "sci-fi" story doesn't qualify AO as "ground-breaking" by itself.

So far you've managed to cite a bunch of features that aren't unique to AO as it's "ground-breaking" aspects.  The only area where AO could be "ground-breaking" would be in Funcom's implementation of the storyline, and even there there have been no "ground-breaking" conceptual implementations to date.

AO is done using an interesting and fairly flexible game engine, no question.  If Funcom ever gets off their butts and puts efforts into telling the story creatively, it could put AO well ahead of it's competitors in terms of immersiveness, etc.  However, as I said before, there just isn't that much "ground-breaking" about AO, contrary to what some folks keep saying on these boards.  In many cases, AO cannot even implement working parity with other MMORPGs to date (except for making the same mistakes).

I'm level 28 and this is happening to me constantly... my MA skill is 200 so I used to do 60-80 damage with normal punches.. It makes fighting some tougher mobs almost impossible

MrWaddles @ 11/19/2001 4:08:35 PM (Empty stores are GAME KILLER 986):
Yo!  Funcom!

Players in your game require access to certain basic items like first aid kits, treatment kits, nano rechargers, etc. to PLAY THE GAME AT ALL.

The fact that such critical items are becoming unavailable in-game is ridiculous, and as worthy of an "Emergency Patch" as any mission problem, hunting problem, etc.

The "empty stores" issue is not getting anywhere near the amount and priority of attention it deserves.  It totally kills the ability for many to play at ALL.

Gurthang @ 11/19/2001 4:27:18 PM (932):
I understand that.. The only reason I mention the team XPs is that I wanted to contrast how that there seems to be a differient system for XP reward.  I found this  discrepency to be rather unfair and possibly a bug.  Is it a high priorty.. NO.. but if you don't mention it it may never get "fixed".

SecretAgentMan @ 11/19/2001 4:34:53 PM (Shopping Channels No Longer Global? 989):
I seem to recall a while back that the shopping channels were made global, so that you didn't have to be in a city to use them, right?

Well I've noticed since 13.0 that although you can turn on the shopping channels outside of town, you can't hear globally or be heard globally, but only by the people in your playfield (confirmed in Lush Fields, Galway Shire and Galway Castle).

While in Galway Shire, for example, I was able to only chat with other people in Galway Shire on the OT Shopping 1-50 channel.

At first, I thought it was so quiet because no one was playing, then when I stepped into Rome, my chat box started scrolling rapidly with dozens of shopping channel messages.  When I stepped back into Galway Shire, the shopping spam stopped.

Toser Ban @ 11/19/2001 4:48:22 PM (976):
Found one a few days ago, inside a mission.  I think it was loot from a MOB, but not 100% sure. It's the one and only, so far (did around 10 missions since then).

Virre @ 11/19/2001 4:59:01 PM (763):
Before the patch I was member of a guild, though I was a little careless when I cleaned out my inventory and accidentially changed sides, resulting in loss of guild status and so on. Now it takes 24hrs of REAL time logged in before one can change back.. after some minor problems with the counter resetting it self IF i logged off, I manged to change back (Was omni in the first place) after the patch. Happily looking forward to participate in the guild again, I fast learned it is not working. Sending a petition gave me a very clever answer ...."It's not working we are trying to fix it. Good luck on Rubi-Ka"   LIKE I DIDN'T know that?? I know it's not working, I was only interested in learning WHEN you plan to fix it as there are many, even guild leaders who can not return to their guilds

Virre @ 11/19/2001 5:06:54 PM (982):
I am a lvl 29MA and I have the damage output you usually have all the time. Can't say I'v noticed it to be any different after the patch, but the damage varies a GREAT deal depending on monster / mobs I fight. Fighting Shades in Lush Fields outpost avverages my damage around 40-80 (Depending if they are Green, yellow or red to me)

So it might be that it's not a bug, but simply the monster / mob you are fighting that has better armor. 

It's also hard to say since you don't say if it's in every fight or just the one with screenshots from.

Vrischika @ 11/19/2001 5:16:25 PM (976):
I've had about thirty people out looking, for over a week now, and only got my hands on four pieces of the stuff, almost all from monster loot, 1xQL23, 1xQL24,  1xQL27, 1xQL45.

It'll need to be MUCH higher drop rate than this if anyone is to take the skill seriously; I have two bags of discs.

Vrischika @ 11/19/2001 5:20:38 PM (827):
This is just one of the many, many broken recpies in game. Life is hard enough for those trying to make a go of these skills, without the kits locking up every other step.

And fix SMG Kits! These have NEVER worked. The Mausser is perhaps the one weapon we have any hope of making and actually selling to other players.

Windowlicker @ 11/19/2001 6:22:40 PM (/org commands seem to be broken on ALL levels post emergency patch after 13.0 1012):
That little patch you released the morning after 13.0 broke ALL /org commands.

On all ranks (Including Leader) you cannot

/org invite
/org promote
/org kick
/org governingwhatever


In each instance there is a confirmation message display'd to the entire guild yet NOTHING happens.


In other words, our entire guild can no longer recruit ANY members, or promote old members.

You nerfed the Faction guild format, so you basicly forced almost all orgs to adopt a Department style format.

The next day you removed our ability to invite period.  As well as promote.


Why is this a problem? ... Why should you have fixed it BEFORE the weekend?


Because now you just caused one HELL of alot of problems for existing leaders, you forced them to change rank structure, which demotes EVERYONE to applicant.

Then the next day you broke all the /org promote and /org invite commands.

So now I have a guild full of applicants, that are all angry because they can't be promoted to the rank they *already* held.


Please fix this last friday.



--- This is what you would call a GAME BREAKING problem.

If you stop us from repopulating our guilds, we will cease to have guilds.

With no guilds, you my friends .... have no game.


Fix them.

If this is a bug I'll say I am thankful for it and I dont think it should be removed.  I would hope that it is a "design decision".  This keeps anti-social solo people from following around a group and stealing their xp.  People could do the same thing in a group, however there is a considerably lower level of jerkism when more than one person is involved.  If you want xp solo then go fight something someone else isn't fighting.  If you are with an organization team that has 7 members, then I'm sure they'd be willing to go 5+2 or 4+3 if they really want you there with them.

1st off ill say Find and describe missions are the lowest token % in the game seeing there manly blitz missions.If you want tokens try these settings 100% stealth 100% money 3 find and return missions nearly gets me 3 tokens every hour. Being a stealth mission more chest and better loot. 6 missions at lvl 60 got me 300k.

where did you get your 50% mission from omni ent again ?

43 mins to get to the clon**** lol ever heard of the grid?


	
		
			
			
				 Prepatch 12.8 I could blitz missions for 260K in less than 2 hours. I had tonnes of locations to choose from. And I actually got stuff that I or others could use.
			
		
	
You said it there i guess they dont want poeple blitzing missions.

I personally have no problem with mission glad there close now Oh how i missed agean missions.

Nianna @ 11/19/2001 6:46:02 PM (986):
This is actually an old bug from 2 or 3 patches back.  It was fixed already only it seems they've reverted to an old code version so they just have to go get the code from the newer version and put it back in.  I agree it should have been faster.  I agree that a bug of this magnitude should be considered an emergency.  Last time we had to live with it for over 2 weeks I believe.

They also have a bug with area effect spells that *still* causes people to root themselves and teammates even after the emergency patch to fix it.  If I target an enemy and cast Sticky Ground, my whole team gets rooted.  I imagine it is the same with other area effect spells of other classes.

spydr @ 11/19/2001 6:50:57 PM (986):
At least this time around with the stores, it's not nearly as universal as it was.  I had to go looking for a store that sold general nanocrystals, but at least I found one with little trouble (but alot of zoneing).  Last time, you had to do things like ask people on the trade channel if there was a store anywhere with the machine you wanted not empty.  Usually they would tell you "yeah, you just have to goto <a zone that is next to impossible for a char of your level to get to>, and it's right there!"

No matter where I am (except inside), it gives me a nice error message.
"data error playfieldtype=0?.."
Then it tells me to check the item (presumably so I can do it right.

Just to be completely sure that it didn't think I was in a zone that didn't allow it, I went down to Mutant Domain (I first tried to use the biograft @ harrys..outside the walls, no less).  Same thing.  I then tried in Galway Shire, Galway Country, Wildlife Preserve (I think thats the name..it's the zone northwestish of Galway Castle), Greater Omni Forest, Newland, and All the cities I could get to.  Same thing.  "data error playfieldtype=0?.."

JerseyBoy20 @ 11/19/2001 7:27:43 PM (856):
I've noticed this as well (the firing repeatedly when reloading). The good point is you don't use any ammo (you're obviously empty). If it helps, think of it as repeatedly pulling the trigger and finding your gun is empty (like in any good action movie out there).

On the other hand, I've noticed a lot of inconsitancies during fights. Massive number of hits against me in no time lapse (lord knows that kind of bug would never work in my favor, that would've been fixed by now in the name of exploitation). Heck yesterday i killed a Mob, it said it was dead, and I then shot it again for damage. I understand making sure something is dead, but please!

Burst has seemed to slow, it's not class specific (I'm a fixer and noticed this as well). My char also experienced the "I don't feel like fighting, so I'll stand here and be shot repeatedly" syndrome as well. So, just as corraboration, this stuff is universal, and hopefully will be patched.

In the 'stuff they're fixing' section, there was a note regarding the unequipping of weapons, and killed nanos. It has something to do with the fact that nanos and weapons are checked before implants, so that your skills aren't high enough to use the equip, hence it's dropped to the inv.

Callex @ 11/19/2001 7:37:36 PM (963):
Agreed Baxie, although my problem is different.

I don't blitz, I sneak, and pre 13.0 I could sneak full red missions with no problem. And by sneak, I don't actually mean sneak around, I buff up conceal, pop on the cloaker and run through, the mobs never see me.

Post 13.0, I sneeze and have the mobs are dancing on my head. Can't pick locks or conceal breaks, can't sit or it breaks, can't jump or it breaks. 

I tried 8 missions, all full reds, most had red cyborgs or other human mobs that spotted me as soon as I walked into the main room. And I tried all the different conceal tricks, like cloaking in the entrance room etc. still nothing. I hear some people are having no problem, I guess I suck... but I am not the only agent complaining about this, spoke with a few in my guild that had the same problems. Conceal is complete borked so I can't run cash missions anymore. I even tried a 75% for kicks and giggles, exactly the same thing with yellow - orange mobs.

And blitzing is not an option, the cash I would make is not worth the med packs I'd use.

I took a mission north of Tir. When i was finished something weird happened :P  I went out and was going to run back to Tir but i ended up starting a wierd place insted outside of the mission. Far south of Tir behind thous big mountains with the sea.

http://home.no.net/csnoname/ao/1.jpg 

I ran back to Tir.. on my way 2 Tir i didnt see any monster and when i come to Tir lol Tir wassnt there :P no people.. nothing just the west gate :P

http://home.no.net/csnoname/ao/2.jpg

Help me! How can i come back to normal ?

Borrace @ 11/19/2001 7:54:27 PM (943):
did funcom say that this was done on purpose???

if it is, why the hell did they create this entire implant system in the first place?

here's an example of how it screws you.

Go to Stret West for a mission...enter a 25% zone...be attacked by some omnis...fight back...run to the mission while the omnis are chasing you...go into the mission...get attacked by 3 mobs in the first room...during battle re-equip your dropped off hand weapon...run away with 50% taken off your health...zone back into stret west where the omni is waiting...get blasted and not being able to defend yourself because one of your weapons dropped back into the inventory...die.

if you have the skills to hold the weapon in the first place, then it is completely dumb to have to re-equip it every time you zone.  simply because i walk into a city doesn't mean that my equipment falls off.

here, everyone try this.

1) grab two books, one in each hand;
2) walk through a door.

did the book in your left hand fall out?

if not, then funcom is dumb.  if yes, then seek medical help, you have a problem.

This is not funny anymore !

Before patch 13.0 i had no problem fighting with my Agent equipt with a Gripo-Com AKR 1K20, it was good and fast and i could hit the monsters !

NOW after patch 13.0 i have very much dificulty hitting monster for damage and i see a slower attacj delay !
Monster below my level seem to hit much often and harder, result is that i have very big problems even trying to solo at missions UNLESS i put the dificult bar to a quarter, but that gives me me more grey monsters and results in not getting a token !

Can you dev guy please look at this !

P.S.
I also noticed this with my Soldier ! he hit less often !

All the guys were very grey to me.  It didn't look like I was going to find anything anytime soon, and my nano was full (so my humidity extractor was doing nothing), so a nuked one of the MA mobs (they usually have the best cash reward).  
I nuked it with Glacial Advance, 288-580 cold damage.  I hit it for ~480 damage.
So either I *somehow* hit it for 960 damage, or I didn't get hit by the 50% PvP damage reduction.  I'm gonna have to go with it wasn't affected. 
			
		
	

That would use cold ac which may not be so affected.  I have noticed that thunderclap which uses melee is doing about 100 less damage.  It should do 194 to 400(something) and I have had several hits in the low 100's.  Glacial advance is working as expected or at least seems to.  I don't use it all that often as it takes to long and they usually start to attack me sometime after I start running it.  Radiation based nanos are still working well too.

Avatarius @ 11/19/2001 8:42:20 PM (404):
This is to just add to the symphony of voices citing *serious* issues with fighting humanoid NPC's in missions which appear to have "Uber" Armor.

My main character Avatarius - could no longer solo even light greens and some greys [that healed] also became virtually unsoloable. I figured I had gimped myself by making too many skill based mistakes [I had taken the pistol route, then switched to Vektor ND Lizard] but found despite having one of the better shotguns in the game [and a 370 attack skill in shotgun to back it up] I was doing almost exclusive minimum damage to humanoid NPC's with the occasional crit. BUT since these seemed to regen with time and heal themselves, the end result was leaving the mission in disgust with myself or dying.

So I rolled a new Char. "Avatario", still an Adventurer but this time going with Riders. In missions I'm still doing only min damage for most shots - however fortunately low level NPC's dont have much more hitpoints than me so its very doable, but that's at level 10! I know darn well it will be a swift return to unplayability for missions once I get into the 30s because its clear from these forum threads that once you get to that level, the NPC's hitpoints just become to high.

I have a Level 70ish Soldier friend with the best range of soldier weapons who as of 13.0 can no longer solo green adventurers [humanoid npcs] because of their heal, and is having trouble with others [takes minutes to fight other humanoid npcs, huge mission times]. He is sadly now seriously considering cancelling, I'm sure he's not the only one.

This is a serious problem which needs addressing right now.

Misophist @ 11/19/2001 9:07:56 PM (211):
I heard that the min-damage against mission mobs was fixed with the server-side patch. But now that I study the boards and still see people complaining about it, perhaps it's not better after all. Silly me didn't test it yesterday with my MA so I don't know if the person who told me (an engineer) was correct. 

Is it still bad?

Kirandar @ 11/19/2001 9:25:42 PM (862):
Can the carrier carry anything other than some extra weight limit, or can your team get a lift?

If all it does is give extra weight limit, then it's a VERY pricey backpack

Davyn @ 11/19/2001 9:43:32 PM (1012):
Friday's patch killed all these commands.  The 'fix' was far worse than the bug.

Guys, this should be a high priority fix.

Ming @ 11/19/2001 9:44:22 PM (Client Server sync issues and more 1042):
Since this latest 13.x patch things are majorly fubared in missions.

A friend and I on side by side PC's were doing a mission and got separated. When we got into the same room I couldn't see him. This has been happening for a long time, but wait it gets better. So I tried to leave the area to zone, but was glassed in by blurry doors. My friend then went off toward the zone and found me in the main hall area. 

I then proceeded to walk around using my keyboard and his players view of me on his monitor to guide myself. On my monitor I was running around in a closet. I managed to find my way to the zone exit and zone, and it worked. My next question is, what would have happened if I'd ran back into the room where my client said I was (in the closet.) Would I have seen myself walk into the room? Would the universe have imploded? What?

Anyway, aside from that, I've noticed a LOT of issues with monsters not being where the client reports they are. As an MA I use brawl quite often, and have noticed an inordinate number of "misses." Some of these may be because AO is totally screwed up right now in regard to AC on human NPCs. (I get a lot of low brawls, and at level 96 this is utter CRAP!! I"m talking brawls for 54 points of %@ damage.) However, a lot of times I can't punch the mobs either, even though they're standing right in front of me. 

Lots of sync issues. 

Another one:

Last night the same friend and another friend were in a mission. We were in a cement bunker mission, not a cave, and in a room with a steel bridge that connected to another room. This was not the broken bridge, but the solid one people always fall through. Anyway, both of them somehow ended up in the ceiling, walking around above the mission area like in Daggerfall. Everytime they'd go above a room with a mob in it, the mob would join them in the ceiling. Between the two of them they got every single mob in the game up in the ceiling following them around. I of course, walked over to the mission item and picked it up. They found a spot to fall finally, but when they did, all the human NPC's began going haywire. It was crazy. I died, hehe, but we didnt care because we got what we wanted. 

Lot's of wierd stuff going on, for sure. 

Targeting self and unable to heal is another. You have to untarget and retarget self. 

Mobs double hitting when they buff or heal is another. 

This patch is utter junk, sorry to say. I'd mind my manners here in this forum, but FC isn't answering, and bad attention is better than none.

Loxt @ 11/19/2001 9:45:24 PM (1012):
I can't stress the severity of this problem... we are on an enforced recruiting freeze because of this totally stupid problem. FunCom, you take the cake - you havn't even addressed this as an issue in any of your announcements or on your startup page, and this IS a game-breaker.

You MUST fix this AT ONCE! You should patch this today! This is utterly unexcusable and needs to be taken care of immediately.

What you experienced is a zoning bug. You simply didn't zone and now you have reached "the end" of that zone playfield. Get a GM to transport you back to "reality" or do a /terminate.

spydr @ 11/19/2001 10:17:30 PM (1022):
I got a bug like that once (a long time ago).

I typically have bad lag, and I way trying to zone out of rome green (this was before; when I had problems figuring out which zone to leave rome from) into rome red, and I was just getting stuck against the zonewall.  I was stubborn, and kept pushing through.  I eventually went through and I ran and ran.  I reached the edge of the world, went through a building-less rome blue, and eventually ran all the way back to where I busted through and re-zoned.

It just happens, sometimes.  Too bad it was a mission, or you could have just zoned back in and come out again.

Xombie @ 11/19/2001 10:20:14 PM (1022):
Oh i've gotten that. It's a glitch where your'e sent to the edge of the Tir City playfield. The playfields have land beyond them just to make the background look cooler. To save some frames, they cut down the activity and rocks and crap on the plane outside the zone borders.
Just find the Tir City zone wall, and head through it. It shoudl put you right back into normality.

If I use my cloaking device and then zone into a mission, sneak gets entirely scr*wed up.   The bug is so weird it's hard to describe - you have to re-cloak, hit sneak, unclock, hit sneak again, etc., and it never straightens itsefl out unless you zone out and then zone back in without the cloaking device on.

Yeah, let's discuss the "amnesty" a second.  Whoops, there went any ability for Omni players to believe there was an actual conflict underway.  Cities filled with roaming Clanners is NOT what we were promised on the box.  All in the name of "balancing" because Clanners were complaining about high prices and inability to get certain items -- so Funcom made it possible for them to get to Omni stores easily, as a fix.  

Where's the story in that?  Do you have any clue how "un-immersive" and implausible such a one-sided amnesty is, while Clan city guards still openly chase and kill Omni citizens?  If that is an example of the kind of "in-game story" we can expect, then this "story" is losing plausibility by the second.

As for the "dynamic storyline", you are aware that the "major characters" in EQ often act as shepherds/actors in in-game GM-run events just to add "story" right?  Frankly, I'd say any of the big GM-run story events on EQ servers remain unparalleled by any of the story attempts on AO to date.  So how is AO "better", let alone "ground-breaking", in that regard?Sorry, but this statement is flat-out untrue.  Both UO and AC allow far greater "class-independent" character development of skills than AO.  Want to fight using pets?  Anyone can train the skills necessary to do that in UO.  Want to be a full-out "Tank Mage"?  Either AC or UO allows far more plausible magic access to any character through appropriate training, as opposed to restricting spell access by "character class".  
[/B]
			
		
	
erm i sort of thought that the "amnesty" was sort of temporary like something happening in the plot and in the game at the same time.  My assumption is...and i could be way off base is that it will end and the easy trips to the omni missions will be over.
Furthermore, I never played EQ probably never will having 0 interest in it since the day it came out, but in UO the gms and seers really weren't all that interesting.  they played favorites and nothing they did with one guild affected anyone else.  But that aside...

I would like to point an interesting groundbreaking feature of AO and that is having almost everyone on the same server.  I almost wish they hadn't started rk2...that seems like a waste and kind of ruined one of the features I found most interesting about the game.  I like being able to play with everyone in the same world it allows for a greater diversity of interaction as far as i am concerned...

Taldrin @ 11/20/2001 12:20:08 AM (211):
Same problem...

My QL 56 mausser (I know I need a new one  ) always hits for a minimum on the human NPCs. Atrox Soldiers and Enforcers seem to be the worst. My hits were from 9-15 damage on lvl 53! Highlight of the fight is my burst which sometimes gets up as high as 50! woohoo!   I'm one of the lucky ones though...I have a Pet  My Glad bot's damage is only slightly reduced by this, so he maintains his 100 damage per hit attack roll. Thus the mob always aggro's my bot, which makes a nice change....

TeamEagle @ 11/20/2001 12:27:37 AM (976):
The drop rate of Carbonrich Rocks is far too low in comparision to the Disc rate.

While it remains true that there are many different types of nano formulas in existance, and that discs have to be able to drop at a rate to make it a vaible option to either loot or purchase from another looter the disc that a player needs; the extremely low rate of Carbonrich drops throws the viability of the Trade Skill into the "too hard to find parts vs. gain recieved" area.

It is nice that Funcom is attempting to work on Trade Skills. The lack of looking at the big picture in implementing them and considering the numbers behind them, however, leave them heading into the same direction as weapon construction (bugged, insufficent availablity of items to create, costs higher than purchasing a fully constructed item from a Terminal in a 2-5x factor.)

Cambist @ 11/20/2001 12:28:00 AM (1042):
I've seen or heard all of this while on missions or hunting with friends. Last night I got rubber banded back to a previous location. I was then instantly killed by an amazing instant quadruple hit. It seems server was out of sync with the client.. 

I've also had a friend asking me why I was standing in a corner while a mob was killing me.. On my screen I was shooting it and doing damage. 

I've had several occasions of being unable to hit the first 5 shots.. Usually after rooting something and seemingly being in range. I'm assuming wherever I thought it was standing it was not. I had to let the root run out and get hit a couple times to shoot things.. Not the ideal way for a nanomage/trader to stay alive.

All of this in addition to cast times not being seperate from physical/ranged attacks makes life tough. Mobs didn't get the same nerf. They cast heals and you get shot twice immediately after. Lots of pain last night for me. :-P

-Sell-

Loxt @ 11/20/2001 12:55:08 AM (943):
ADD TO LIST:

1) Mongo now re-taunts whenever you zone. A rather unpleasant suprise when I ran out of a mission the other day with only 200hp left only to get jumped by 4 NPC's that were tuanted by my mongo that was still running when I zoned out of the mission.

2) ORG FUNCTIONS BUSTED! ok, so I hear they're fixing this on Wednseday, but DAMN what a stupid f-up...

3) Nano buffs running out while you are in a plane causes fall damage, 326 points worth with each buff that deacitvated last night, killed my buddy that I was flying with.

4) Sometimes mission maps just disappear. Happened to me when I entered a large room last night, the rest of the map just went away, but it came back once I left the room.

5) Definitely some Mob's are getting a major AC upgrade - you guys whacked something out with this...

6) NPC's chain-casting root nanos - oh, this one's really fun, they root ya and then shoot from out of range (I'm melee), and I cast rage, and they rooted me 3 more times in a row while I was trying to run. Fixers are now on my s-list, right next to FunCom =p

7) ok, so I understand that you want to make MOB's a little more intelligent, but come on, this crap with going after the doc every-single-stinking-time-they-heal is MAJOR BS, and TOTALLY destroys this profession. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT ALREADY IS TO FIND A DOCTOR TO GROUP WITH???????? Jeebus what a bunch of morons... fix this, make it like it was before, this is just stupid FC, and I hate to see all my doc buddies suffer so...

8) Getting a lot of error messages trying to initiate an attack when switching between MOB's. This is garbage, you have been working on this crap ever since you fixed the Q-tap exploit ("take it easy" crap) but you still havn't got it right. I could only stand there and watch my firend die in a mission the other night because I couldn't initiate my attack until the MOB aggro'd me (and Mongo Bash wasn't pulling the MOB off my friend).

When are we ever going to get a stinkin' patch that doesn't break more than it fixes?????????????

I am SO TIRED of being your stupid little BETAMONKEY!!! AND PAYING YOU FOR IT!!!

Ok, so how about a solution? LET US COPY OUR PLAYERS TO THE TEST SERVER!!!! If you did this, I would gladly be your betamonkey... and you could get more information on all levels of game play.

Misophist @ 11/20/2001 1:04:42 AM (1042):
Ming, I had a similar experience with my level 6 token farmer Trader.

Before I tell you about that, let me just add a rant about tokens: why is it that I have to token farm at level 6 to get a decent amout of tokens? Well, I know why, but the very fact that it's necessary should say something.

Anyway, back on topic. Sorry for the digression. 

My trader went into a mission last night. Now, I hadn't rebooted in a while, and thus my memory leak/virtual memory problem was kicking in. So when I entered the man room from the lobby of the mission, the game halted for a few seconds. When my hard drive stopped thrashing, I noticed that I had accidentally rushed the first room and saw the message that I was being attacked by 3 techwreckers. Oops, well, I didn't feel like dealing with that, so I tried to go outside, only I couldn't. No playshift failure messages, nothing. Just couldn't leave at all.

So I go back into the main room. One of the techwreckers was standing there like a statue, but I didn't see any of his buddies. None of them were attacking me. All of a sudden, a waste collector started pounding on me. From where? I have no idea. My trader autoattacked and killed it, but still, I couldn't tab anything besides that stupid techwrecker. And then it happened again and again. Mobs that I couldn't see or tab were attacking me. I survived, went back to the lobby to heal, and came back to the main room.

Techwrecker still standing there like a lump. Only now all the doors in the main room were fuzzed/mirrored out and I couldn't enter them. I sighed, went back to the lobby, and logged out.

I planned to try and log in again, but forgot and went to sleep instead.

Vaavoom @ 11/20/2001 1:26:27 AM (875):
Tnite,
I think your missing my point. This happens on all mobs, any level, any con. I dont think it's a AC problem or Int problem, but a game bug.

nhaz @ 11/20/2001 1:28:00 AM (862):
as far as I know the carrier craft is a underground vehical its not mentioned in the descrition like "The Mid" craft are not mentioned to be cloakers yet they are.

So I don't think thats a bug, ive seen these craft in action and once underground they are marked above ground by a Small flashing dot on the surface almost impossibly to detect unless you are looking specificatly for that flashing dot.

you might see tail fins sticking out of the ground but it is completly submerged to everyone else

Xombie @ 11/20/2001 1:51:33 AM (875):
I think it might be related to a flaw in the new PvP changes. since it seems to happen more often with NPC mobs, then maybe the game is confusing mobs with players?

Barzillai @ 11/20/2001 1:57:59 AM (763):
Yes indeed it was the mission fix that broke /org code...but how are these two even related? I can't (as a programmer) fathom how mission code could affect /org functions.

Nevertheless, this needs to be fixed pronto...I've got new recruits that are waiting to get in...and if it's slated for Wednesday great.

I've seen this, and what appears to be happening is this:

When you enter mission rooms with floors a bit "below" or "above" (i.e. differing in avg Z coord) that of the "rest of the mission", the game shows only that room and any other rooms in the mission at the lower floor level.  If you walk around the room a bit, and find a way to climb up on something, you'll usually see the rest of the mission map suddenly reappear as you get close enough to the "normal Z level" for the mission floors.

I agree, it's very distracting to suddenly have your map flickering in and out depending on your current Z coordinate, and it's clearly design-related in "which level map" gets displayed.

Funcom, here's the fix (not that they'll ever read it):

The "delta-Z" tolerance for what map areas are considered the "same level" as the rest needs to be expanded.  Ideally it needs to be expanded to encompass the entire range of floor-level Z coordinates in an ACG area.

Sumonia @ 11/20/2001 2:04:12 AM (404):
I wonder if Funcom even read these boards.....i wonder if it will ever get fixed. One day they will turn around and notice their player base will hold exactly 10 peeps..... and i bet them 10 will be people who dont play that much ( not enough to notice the bugs ! )

This is entirely a function of "popularity".  Beyond a certain number of average subscribers playing at any one time, Funcom will need to open more servers.  They just aren't running into that problem, for the most part, due to low game population.  Those other games have so many servers because they have so many subscribers playing, on average, at any one time.

At it's high-point (call it a few weeks before the 12.6 debacle), they were pretty clearly starting to push the single-server capacity of RK1 most of the time.  RK2 was far more important then, of course, because it had much more overflow to handle.

Now, on the other hand, they could probably go to a single server with ease.  Game population seems WAY down even at "peak playing times" compared to a few months ago.

Borox @ 11/20/2001 2:09:58 AM (862):
A carrier craft gives you an increase in strength. I decided to switch over to strength and agility armor, and the boost to my strength means I don't have to put as many ip's there to equip a new piece of armor. A boost of 130 points is well worth the 58k or so it cost me. When I want to upgrade a piece of armor I climb into the craft, put the armor on, and get out of craft, done deal.

blu789 @ 11/20/2001 2:16:45 AM (404):
Yup, in12.8 I used to be able to solor orange / just barely reds.

Now in 13, yellows of the adventurer / enforcer type are eating me alive.

MrWaddles @ 11/20/2001 2:55:56 AM (986):
Yep, it's definitely escalating this time too, just like last time.  The stores aren't refreshing, and eventually ALL of the affected store types will run out of stock.

And yet, no mention whatsoever of Funcom fixing this in tonight's/tomorrow's "update".  The notion that org commands are more important than players being able to get first aid supplies is ludicrous, but then, what about Funcom's "management" of this game isn't?

I do hope they're not expecting folks to hurry out and purchase Midgard when it becomes available.  That might lead to them having a very unpleasant surprise.  I know of my friends that already left AO, all of them have said they'll never buy a Funcom product ever again.  I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment, for staying around here.

I know it's a fix.. the same applies to an Enforcer's line of nano.

But... this fix is a NERF for users of such shields like ADVs.

THey could always put a check in the reflect damage such that it does not reflect damage caused by SELF.

The 13.0 patch did nothing to Adventurers, it has seriously impacted all professions. Apparently humanoid NPC's have ended up with "Uber" Armor Class values for the 3 main kind of armor classes [melee, projectile, energy] so soldiers, agents, adventurers, enforcers - they are ALL doing minimum damage 


cut this from the adventurer's page. There is something COMPLETELY out of whack in missions now.

1. As stated above......against human mobs be the green or orange......I have found that I can do ONLY a very minimum dmg. My 18 pt dmg shield does more than I can hit for.

I only do ONE amount of damage consistently. Be it 12 or 15, it will always be the same through the fight. 

All the while the MOBS minimum dmg on me is usually 60+ (orange mob) 40 odd (green to yellow mob)

This is fair......NOT
This is fun......NOT


2. MoBs regenerating VERY quickly when requiring to zone to heal/nano up.

I totally enjoy slapping a mob for a max of 14 pts dmg all the while its punding down on me for 50+, work my way to get it to half....to have to zone cause Im out of BOTH health and nano from healing.......to zone back in to see it almost back to full health!

3. Last night I petitioned this....for each mob I fought in a  mission (well a couple actually), though they all conned the same, low-orange...each mobs ratio of nrml hits (65) to crits(150) changed so that the ratio of crits was far more than the ratio of normal hits.....ie.....only critting, not *hitting*

these were clawfingers and, no, I didn't have any debuffs cast on me.

My complaint is NOT the amount of dmg, it is the ratio of dmg by nrml hit to crit....eg.

I also noticed that each prgressive mob had an increase in dmg output!

Mob1 : 60 60 60 138 60 60 138 60 60
Mob2 : 62 148 62 148 62 62 148
Mob3 : 156 63 156 63 634 156 156
Mob4 : 160 160 160 160 160 160 65 160 160
Mob 5 : Mission deleted

again, I would like to express it is NOT the NUMBER shownm in the dmg ie...dewd you should put ur dodge up man....

Look again, it is the RATIO of normal hits to Crits from the mob!

Fortunately in THIS encounter...I was not limited to 12pts a hit...brawl doing only 32 and fast attack doing 32.......

3. FFS shops are a waste! I truly enjoy spending the first 1.5 hours of my login time running from city to city to shop to shop to do ti again because there's no *appropriate* QL for me. Thank christ I am NOT shoipping for clusters!

Closest QL I find for me in merchants/riders is 15 levels below or 20+ levels above!

This has been the way since day1. Why is it such a problem for us to be able to equip ourselves?

Shopbot is a good idea.....yet to recevie a reply from it. I like to play, not sit on my arse in athens listening/spamming shopping channels for hours on end.

It's getting to the satge where I need to horde any item that I *may* be able to use 30 levels down the road, so that when I get those 30 levels I'll know for sure I'll have something.

...pointing this out for those who like to pick people's posts apart....shopping channel has an assortment of goodies...just not what I'm after.....

4. ARK's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
have always been responsive and polite/helpful.

5. need to slam cancel key several times sit stand sit stand sit...THEN can I use my healing/nano packs. Not always but SOMETIMES, targetting a door tehn myself helps fix this.

...need I go on?

This keeps anti-social solo people from following around a group and stealing their xp.
			
		
	
So what your telling me its fine for a group to steal a kill from a individual dispite that individual having actually tanked the kill but not visa versa.  And then you go on to say that its acceptable for other groups to do it. Just for the sake that it prevents "anti-social" play.  Hey.. GO BACK TO EQ!  Kill stealing is kill stealing even if it is a group or a individual who does it!  In fact groups are the worst offenders by far!  The reason is that because someone has back-up they feel they can take more than maybe they normally would so it becomes a competition between the two groups that devolves from a civilized turn taking into a full out free for all!  With each group calling each other names and trying to take all the kills to drive off the other group. This will sometimes in the most ANTI-SOCIAL levels result in one group training a herd of nasties that they know the other group can't handle just to get rid of them.  And if you don't think this happens then you have obviously never teamed in a popular area very often.


	
		
			
			
				If you want xp solo then go fight something someone else isn't fighting.
			
		
	
I was if you had read my message.. in fact I tried several methods to get XP and only succeded about 20% of the time to get ANY.. I'm not talking a small amount the rest of the time I'm talking zip.. zero.. nada.. zilch not even a message!  All I wanted was a few XP before logging out in the hopes of leveling, having already gotten over 90% of what I needed to level in teams earlier.  So I went to a camp that as long as I have been playing in Plesent Medows is in a constant state of free for all.. (Read everybody is kill stealing already so me "assisting" would not be noticed.)  Shoot I even asked to team beforehand hoping someone would be interested.. Got no replies so I did my usual and began casting. You see my theory was that if I was attacking the same NPC type as the group I would not be in as much danger since the groups would always attack any additional BHs that I aggroed.  Unfortunatly 12+ to my 1 invariably in them stealing the kill no matter if I waited for them to hit first or I caught it as soon as it spawned (got first hit).


	
		
			
			
				If you are with an organization team that has 7 members, then I'm sure they'd be willing to go 5+2 or 4+3 if they really want you there with them.
			
		
	
I'm not sure what your talking about here.. the maximum number of members in a group is six not seven.  And as far as guilds go.. why should I grab a guildmate for a brief jaunt before logging out.

biggfoo @ 11/20/2001 5:23:41 AM (614):
I used on handmade and kit and I have to say if they fix this tradeskill, I for one will buy all my medkits and such from a player that makes them. 

The got one thing right they are farsuperior to the ones you can buy in stores. Lower reqs and higher healing.  Just have to fix the quanity, and make it a little cheeper.

you might see tail fins sticking out of the ground but it is completly submerged to everyone else

Dienst @ 11/20/2001 7:27:00 AM (A bug or me 1094):
JUst wondering if any one else has same prob. Missions where rooms are seperated by water,when swim across can not gain access to other side.At one time could swim across and climb up without any keystrokes and continue to next room.Now 90%of time have to jump around like a fish on a hook to try and get out,and in doing so what little concealment that was left from the nerf is completely gone and am attacked and sometimes killed before can get out of water.Have looked at it in 3rd person and seem to be morphing into the walls sometimes.Curious if any one else has encountered this,,its making things extremely hard if not impossible for me

Darkblood @ 11/20/2001 7:42:23 AM (1094):
I've noticed this great annoyance as well.

in fact I've noticed a LOT of new *physical* problems of getting stuck on terrain once fluently traversed acroos the world.

I play a doctor in RK1, he's lvl 66 now. This new patch has really changed things.

First of all, hunting is not an option anymore as all mobs are aggroing me instead of those mongoslamming tank-enforcers i used to group with. Just one or two team heals and they all are on me. Sure, with some creative chainhealing and HoT I can stay alive for a while, but eventually i will run out of nano. And until recently I did all my heals inside kodiak that allowed me to outrun aggoed mobs, but that option seems to be disabled too.

Well, I was a bit tired to hunting anyway, so I decided to do some missions (last time i did missions was when i was lvl 20 and that Freedom arms / pistol nerf occured). I went to avalon and took 2 25% missions to aegean and one 60% mission to that same location. I felt strange as those 2 missions had rewards of 15k and 60% mission-reward was 25k. (50 QL90 nanochargers I use are about 20k so that's really not that much money.)

But at the mission location things went strange again. I ran through the dungeon and found my mission objective. As i tried to identify the item a text appeared on screen stating that mission check will not be done while in fight. Great.

So now i have to kill all mobs inside to complete mission? Hmm, I wondered, how an earth i could accomplish that? I haven't used any IP's to weapons skills for a long time as the only light blue wep-skill is pistol and those have been useless for a long time. They just dont bite it and dual-wield is impossible for decent QL pistols.

So my only attacks are DD-nanos (shatter bone: about 50-120 melee dmg and gouge flesh, 150-250 melee dmg ) and two veeeery slow stackable DoT's that do 52 and 54 dmg / tic and with these two only thing that you can kill are leets at the newb ground. (Go refresh the DoT said releasenotes.. just wondering who can stay alive long enough to do that?)

But anyway, packed with these options i returned to the mission. Buffed up with team HP buff that seems to work without team again and painfully short self-HP buff (6mins duration!) add HoT (for 2min duration) and in i go.

I fought greens and greenish oranges inside with modest success. I had to burn my entire nanopool + 1-3 nano FA's to accomplish that but I did kill those mobs without sweat (thanks to HoT).

So, doing fine? That mission area just happens to be quite large. after 2 hours and 50 nanochargers i completed the mission. And what did i get? Looted ql30-40 garbage until my inventory was full, looted 8k from the dead mobs. And the reward: 22k and a token + grey pants with waterlily print (2k in Miiir).

Unfortunately those 50 chargers (QL90) and 30 nano FA's are just about 25k. So that didn't help me at all. I have 450cr and it seems that it will stay that way forever.

Maximilian @ 11/20/2001 10:40:40 AM (943):
Fortunately I was able to gather nice team yesterday evening (*; CET) that we had some fun with in the Wailing Wastes (any ETA for the map?). We did three team missions together which gave rise to some good news and some more annoying news.

At first the good news (always stay polite, even if it is hard  ):
- (Although) I choose 1.1 difficulty missions, there was only one grey NPC/MOB in all of the three missions (must have been around 80+ encounters in total)
- Non of the NPCs/MOBs was red to me as the lighest level char in the team (45)
- Most of the encounters where either green or orange (some dark orange), yellows were rare?
-> The balancing of the team missions seems to be (good) acceptable from here (I will discuss this later)

The bugs that the team and myself observed:
- Invisible attacker (actually the MOB attacked through a wall)
- Water problem (jump to exit)
- Mobs stuck at the edge of a pool that are not attackable (they seem to have the same problem as we do  ). You have to reach the same Z-level (thanks jwiede) to initiate combat.
- One of the team mates simply went invisible during the mission. I had him on the team list, he was in range, all but me could see him??
- The mission reward ($). The money was not distributed at all. I got the 'correct share' of the total, nobody else got a penny. I don't mind dividing the money manually, but it would be nice, if I have the full ammount to distribute and not have to take it from my own.
- Anyway the sum was lousy for a 5-team (8-10k per mission).
- The weapon of our soldier was 'jammed' during one fight (block of specials?)
- After one tough fight (several MOBs) I couldn't use my Nano recharger, even self targetting didn't help. After executing a nano formula it worked again.
- Sparrow Flight Other and SF Team are still not fully functional:
-- They still end at each zone, outdoor or not (luckily the removal is complete now, no double zoning necessary)
-- The first time I casted SF Team all team members where morphed but I was not? No biggy (where did I hear this???  ), but strange. Second time and follow ups it worked.
-- It is still very annoying that I can't execute any nano as reet. To repeat myself: If you don't want anybody morphed to reet form cast damage dealing nanos, then please restrict the appropriate nano formulas, not the reet form. Cure the cause, not the symptom!

Discussing team balance and difficulty:
At first: It is a 'really' complicated issue and I for sure lack experience to have a (good) overview, although I do team missions as often as possible.
Background: A friend of mine (Enf40) and myself(Adv45) teamed in Borealis (2). To get to some action I chose 3 TEAM missions (find item) in Wailing Wastes (highest possible cash reward for acceptable travel distance and 75% zone). I set the difficulty to 1.1 - remember, team of two. Usually I am able to solve SINGLE missions of this difficulty in about 50% of the cases or with his help in 90+% of the cases. At this time I expected a team of three, maybe four (DOC and/or MA, wishful thinking, you know).
We stopped in Newland to ask for assistance. Finally a Soldier (lvl39) joined and brought two friends (a MP and a ??? (Enf?) lvl 37 and 39, if I remember correctly - forgive me guys, it was late).
With this team of 5 we headed to WW and finished the three missions within a reasonable time (2-3 hours).
If I recall correctly, everybody in the team levelled, including myself. I made about 70k xp. We had two casualities, mainly based on 'suboptimal' team coordination (two orange agents in an acid room and one while being attacked without having the team together).
Questions that arose:
- When is the MOB difficulty set? On entering the area or on accepting at the mission at the terminal. 
-- First case: If I would like to be cheaty: I would gather my team, get to the mission area, remove all from the team but the weakest (! level wise) two enter and rejoin. Pour ones that would use such tricks.
-- Second case: Would remove trick, but as we did (without purpose) you will never have the complete team at the mission terminal.
--- Both methods are not 110% save, but if possible, I would like to gain some insight. Some of us like to enjoy the game together with others  - yes, I am an Adventurer. And therefore an 'acceptable' setting of team missions could help a lot - Thanks in advance for any answer.

Hope this fits into one post.

So long,

Max(imilian)

* Actually I am really amazed that some people are still teaming with an adventurer, but nevertheless happy about.

Crono5 @ 11/20/2001 12:33:32 PM (556):
I dont know what ur guys problem is but I see it as a big problem. If U play the mission U will find out that ur getting more credit after finishin it then what it said in the reward. Im gettin like 5k for the reward for my lvl 35 character. Cant run in and run out with the reward cuz they add hella more mob in the mission area. No problem I kill everything and get 5k for reward, 5k for loot and 3k to 15k+ from selling. That per mission. I think how they set up the mission is better. If u want to play mission that far then put the difficult to like 75% and the slider to full money, That basicly what the settin are on before the patch. I die so many time in clondkye by those stupid rock monster, 2 head wolf, and panther. It wasnt worth 10k, or find out the mission area was all yellow and orange when the slider was on 50%. Wasnt cool at all so They did a great job settin up the mission.

Vrischika @ 11/20/2001 12:43:53 PM (614):
The Bio Comuutor is different to the other tools in that you need to combine the Monster Parts *onto* the tool, not the other way around. Make sure the unit is in a main inventory slot and not a bag.

I shouldn't bother though; the kits are expensive to make, only minimally useful, and complete unsellable.

Maximilian @ 11/20/2001 1:09:28 PM (943):
Nexsus, I might doubt your statement.

I have one character, that is neutral (Adventurer). I started in Borealis with the neutral starter maps in my inventory, that I uploaded immediately (09.09.01). Since then I have the following problem:
There are three 'playfields' that contain the word Newland:
- I   Newland City; the city itself within the gates
- II  Newland (???) the surroundings of Newland (lake, Meetmedere, ...)
- III Newland Desert
[names might not be entirely correct]

I and III always worked for me, long before the Newland maps were available at the shops. II never did, nor does it today. I bought every single map in the shop that my skill is high enough for, and uploaded it (I am an Adventurer). Even the Newland map and the Newland city map quite recently (have to check on this again). All maps labelled Newland give me the message 'Map already uploaded'. I check in my profile, and it says, all Newland maps are there?
I really don't know where the mistake is located. I have an assumption, that there is a name conflict between 'old' maps and new maps, so I can't upload it or it doesn't refer to it properly, but this is a wild speculation. So if you know something I don't, please help me. Thanks in advance.

Or, just in case, somebody might explain to me how to upload the 'Newland' map.

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.S. Anyway, I can life with it, but it indeed helps heading towards a given direction.

Hile @ 11/20/2001 1:59:27 PM (614):
I just  have to bump this- FunCom will make the game uber for me if they fix the treatment kits. I have tried to make some so far (knowing that they are broken) in anticipation of the time they are fixed. It would be nice if FunCom could respond here as to approx time or in the next patch build notes or in the coming up forum. Afterall they did judge that it was important enough to mention in the 13.0 patchnotes that a) the kits could now be  built and b) that the charge system was not working (ie broken). The fact that they did this implies that it was relatively high on their list to implement this tradeskill and that it is on their minds to improve. 

Certainly I cannot wait for when they do !!!!  =)

Garr @ 11/20/2001 2:17:02 PM (Weight limit 1127):
I'd like to say, that WEIGHT LIMIT is STILL not calculated while in the same playfield (IE to get it to show the correct number, you have to shift). This client bug has been there FOR MONTHS.

Now, A LVL 10 character getting NOTHING but Clon**** and Stret East/West Missions (IS) a GAMESTOPPER. because they have NO HOPE IN HELL of making it that far to do a mission.
			
		
	
50% agree. Oki its right that the misisons to Street East/West bank are very closed but Clon**** ?!
Nono, nearly all Clon**** missions are around the Grit (ok some are at Mines, but look at the Coord if you get 1). Clon**** is one of the easyst Zone for Missions. Look at the coordinates if you get one. But its a nice idea to add a "Near <-> Far" slider. hope its comming.

PS: currently the mission are easy right. but my nano crystals cost over 200k and the implantats .. no comment :-P. Now I must spend 2x - 3x more time to the the same cash as for 3 patches.

Kyuss9 @ 11/20/2001 2:53:23 PM (Agents and missions 1130):
How’s the life of an agent in AO? Not very nice since the 12.6 patch…
Just to give you an idea, here are some of our daily problems:

- Our only special attack is a joke (I know, I know…you’re going to fix it). Aimed shot is useless.
- We don’t have any kind of special attack to get us out of a tight situation (Aimed shot can only be used in the beginning of the fight).
- Our regular damage is too low and/or slow for missions. Powerfull riffles (Tsak and Flechette) are too slow for missions. Faster ones like Stigmas, can’t be bought in stores…
- One of our main skills – concealment - is totally broken – Using Ruse of Taren and the Pronouncement of greatness nano (under Adventurer FP) with the concealment skill my agent has, I get almost 700 in concealment and I still get spoted by green NPCs all the time.
- We can only solo missions up to 30 – 35% difficulty. Beyhond that we get wasted most of the time. When trying the concealment approach, we get spoted in a matter of seconds. When that happens “half” the NPCs in that mission will be after you (even if they are two rooms away…). When trying the “fighting” approach (i.e. trying to kill all the NPCs) no use considering any mission above 35% difficulty. Beyhond that difficulty lvl, most of the time I’m not able to get further than the 2nd room…Just yesterday I got killed by 2 green NPCs in no more than 10 seconds…

Funcom, are you aware that:

1 –The actual state of the Agent profession, makes it impossible to solo missions above the mentioned difficulty lvl?
2- Agents are being forced to: either play low lvl missions or to overequip to be successful in missions?
3 – Is almost impossible for agents to get Tokens (low lvl missions don’t give Tokens since most of the mosnters are grey. 50% difficulty and above are impossible to finish.
4 – Agents have to spend much more time in missions than Soldiers and other professions, since we are forced to do lower lvl missions with poorer loot and smaller money prize. This also allows other professions to lvl faster since they can spend more time hunting.
5 – All these problems encourage people with Agent chars to overequip, so that they can keep the pace with other professions.


Just to clarify, my agent is lvl 71, using armour around QL 70, implants with an average QL of 30, using a QL 95 Riffle…an average player I think.
I play since Beta 4 so I think I have some notion how the game works…the only solution I see (from the player side) to this situation is overequipping, which is something I don’t like to do, and something I think Funcom doesn’t want to keep spreading through the game…
Where’s the fun in this Funcom? 
Missions shouldn’t be a punishment…they should be, at least, as fun as hunting is. Right now, agents aren’t having any fun doing missions…it’s not fun dying over and over again, having to spend endless hours doing low lvl missions, getting crappy prizes to buy a new pair of armor gloves, when other players get money to buy a whole new armor doing 2 or 3 missions!

Is the dev team aware of this issues? Are they going to be adressed soon? Any info. on how this issues will be handled?

Esmee @ 11/20/2001 4:06:47 PM (647):
This thread has to be bumped!!
Missions are entirely screwed up!!!!!!!!

First of all
Doctors are horribly horribly horribly screwed in missions...not because we can't kill anything and they are a big waste of time for us..its always been that way, but because a chair or a table blocks our line of sight!! This must be fixed!!!!!!!
Also a heal cannot be cast through a door, but a dot or dd can.  What did you do to doctors heals??????? Adventurers can heal through doorways but I can't!!  Fix this!!  Even if someone is right next to me on the other side of a doorway i can't heal them.  This is not right and it is very annoying and makes missions even more frustrating.  

Which brings me to my second point which is simply that missions...I'm sorry, they really suck.  Individual missions are too big and too far away...the too far away part I don't mind but the money is too little.  At level 128 the lowest ql mission I can get is ql 88.  I basically get 20k credits for traveling at least ten minutes.  And forget the harder missions because they are too big and filled with things that kill weakling characters like mine very easily.  I find missions very tedious and boring, so blitzing is the only option for money, I am shocked that anyone can even take the time to fight through them because they are so very very dull.

Let me reiterate: Missions are very tedious and boring.  VERY boring.  I don't know a single person that enjoys doing missions past level 50.  There is absolutely no reason why an individual mission should take three hours.  The incredibly large and tedious missions should be confined to group only.  I dread having to upgrade anything because I know it means I have to run missions for days until I can find one I can blitz or if I'm lucky I can convince friends to do a couple missions with me, but then we have to do some for everyone and quite frankly after one mission, who wants to do anymore?

I feel very bad for my friends who can no longer upgrade any of their equipment because they simply cannot blitz missions and no one wants to do missions.  Agents are the most popular people on the planet because they can sneak through them.

Please!  Misisons are horrible!  They are too big and too buggy.  Not to mention the fact that they are all the same. It makes me want to cry thinking of having to fight through a hundred rooms of the same monster over and over and over again.  If you cannot do anything else, please just make individual missions a bit smaller.  
Not everyone has the time or inclination to spend hours upon hours slaving through them, I realize that you should have to work a bit for equipment and money, but this is supposed to be fun, not work that makes you want to cry and take a nap.

Why?

Rookie Clan Bountyhunter (Cons Yellow) hit you for 112
You hit Rookie Clan Hunter for 26
Rookie Clan Bounty Hunter hit you for 137
You hit Rookie Clan hunter for 140 points of burst damage
Rookie Clan Bounty Hunter hit you for 104
Rookie Clan Bounty Hunter healed for 230
Changing area please wait
Heal to full
Changing area please wait

Repeat this about 40 times per mission and then receive a mission reward for 12K after 3 hours worth of work.

Why do you think?

How about we press the "Funcom told us they would be fixed. Funcom told us they had been fixed. Funcom go fix it" button instead. 

I might as well go hunt Slayerdroids as blitz missions with Scooplets and Diglets in it. My chances of survival are less than 0 and I wouldn't get XP even I killed some of them.

Oh and Muftak. The 43 minutes was to get to the grid, through it and out in clon**** then to my mission area. (This was before my Car and my Gridrunner. Had to rely on the lowest Run buff fixers get. Add to that that it was as south in clon**** as you can get. Poor NTs without cars. And I had to go there 4 times. Once for each death.)

I have a 108 Agent with a unbuffed conceal of over 600. With Ruse2, leet form (aka uber-gerbil) and  a cloak my conceal is easily around 1600.  This allows me to sneak just about 0 quality missions post 13.0.  Most of the time mobs in the main room will agro before I can even hit conceal while entering a mission area.  Before 13.0 I was able to sneak mission/run with a cloak with some degree of danger, it was a challenge and it was fun.  Now, an agent's core defining skill is useless.  Furthermore, the reduction in the conceal skill's effectiveness lowers the propensity of getting an aimed shot.  So in 13.0 aimed shot was addressed and then nerfed again with a conceal fix.

What is worse is funcom continues to "stealth" nerf conceal (the irony is partially humorous).  In other words just about every time conceal is "improved or "balanced," Funcom does not indicate what the change is in advance.  Given, the horrible record Funcom has demonstrated in testing before a patch is released to a live server, how are these nerfs ever tested for effect before they are applied?  They are not, so don’t give us the official line- aka Lie that they have been fully tested.

So fix conceal, It would also be nice to provide an eta on the fix. But I will not hold my breath.  Now on, a positive level the game is in general getting better, but Funcom stop playing with conceal. Just fix it.

Elsid @ 11/20/2001 4:57:22 PM (647):
For all of you having trouble fighting through a mission, you sure can't sneak through them either. So I feel your pain, so let me add some of my own.

Since V13.0, these now spawn on backyard terminals with the rest of the curios, and are also available as mission rewards.

Don't pay more than 3k for these now.

Zaal @ 11/20/2001 6:09:59 PM (Pet Health Zones Bug and one other question 1156):
Pet health.  My engineer babe has an interesting dilemna.  It appears in the actually game engine that our pets don't ACTUALLY zone.  There is an instance of the pet in each zone that gets activated when you get there.  And the last known state of the pet is remembered for that pet and then activated.  Know what that means?

I run a mission and my pet takes 50% damage.  I get the reward adn zone out of the mission with my pet at 50% HP and outside the mission he is 100%.  I run to my next mission and zone into it.  My pet goes BACK down to 50% HP.

This is totally a bug that needs fixing.  I plan on submitting an in-gmae bug report about this ASAP.  Has anyone else noticed this?


Thanks!

And although I won't hold my breath, I would love to see a Funcom response to this....

MuscularBeaver @ 11/20/2001 6:10:31 PM (Missions: What a waste of time!!!  MOB stats are nuts. 1157):
I wanted to play for an hour or so last night, so I logged in and took a mission close to a terminal in Lush Hills/Fields.  What a total waste of time!! 

First room: 3 gray Rookie Outlaws.  It took me 15 minutes and zoning at least 5-7 times to kill the first one.   Then the next one kept healing - this is new, because usually they've run out of healing nanos by now.  So after maybe 30 minutes of play, I get what?  A whole 3 xp.

Then I sneak to a room, attack a yellow NT.  A yellow something-or-other-with-healing-nanos runs out of a room to join the fight.  

So I spent the next 20-30 minutes zoning in and out waiting for that other MOB to go away so I could finish the fight with the NT.  The process took so long I almost got to use dimache twice on that same NT.  

When I finally defeated the NT, the other MOB jumped on me, and I fought, zoned, fought, zoned, fought, zoned until I finally gave up.  There was no way to win against this super-healer.  Gave up.  Went to bed. 

Funcom, stop screwing around with the game balance!!   This is nuts!

monitorlizard @ 11/20/2001 6:14:58 PM (Comments and questions on 13.2 1158):
Not sure if this is the right forum.  I just read the prelim build notes for 13.2 and --

What is the state of Item pickup missions?  Still broken?


	
		
			
			
				Fixed a bug that caused secondary weapons to de-equip when switching playfields. Basically, when re-building the character after zoning, weapons were checked before implants were, thus when trying to place the weapon, the implants would not be taken into consideration and you would not meet the requirements.
			
		
	
What if you used a Proficiency or Expertise nano in order to equip your secondary weapon?  Will they still de-equip?


	
		
			
			
				Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the "You countered the nanoprogram... to flood your chat.

I've been doing Item pickup missisons with no problems since they announced it was fixed on the log in.

Zaal @ 11/20/2001 6:21:47 PM (775):
You can recreate this manually.  The south wall of Tir has a ramp right next to it and you can run up the ramp and jump OVER the wall of Tir City.  You can then run to the edge of the zonemap if you want to.  It's really a dumb bug.  I'm surprised that the zones aren't more bubble or full wall like around certain cities (or all of them since people have Yalmahas)

Pyetr @ 11/20/2001 6:33:01 PM (Information screen bugged 1160):
I keep a lot of items in the information screen for trading purposes, so I won't have to run back and forth to the bank and all.  But once you log out, most of the items vanish.  Some of them stay (and it's the same ones every time), but I can't figure out why those stay and not others.  It's a chore to have to pull all the items from the bank and add them to info every time, but I recognize that this is somewhat low priority.

RoboKa @ 11/20/2001 6:46:03 PM (FYI- very very minor 1164):
The description of this forum says small graphic glitches, so here goes!

There are two mission rooms that I think have been over looked in graphic clean-up.

In the standard Omni mission buildings (ya know, rooms with real doors and not the ones in pleasant meadows) there is a room that appears to be a cell block.  It is a 2x2 room with the entrance and exits on opposite walls in the same half of the room.  THe other half of the room has a corridor going down the middle perpendicular to a line draw through the entrance and exit doors.  On either side of this corridor there are 2 smaller rooms (4 total) that I believe are supposed to represent prision cells.  they each have a functioning door and contain stuff like cots, sinks, et cetera.  The extremely minor issue that I want to point out here is that there is a segment (looks like a quarter of a circle) of some object just floating in the entrance/exit half of this room.  It doesn't make any sense begin there, it doesn't serve a purpose, it doesn't cause a problem (except possibly confusing newbies).  You'll know what I mean when you see it.

In cave mission buildings, there is a cornering room. One entrance and one exit on adjacent walls.  This room has a large floating arrow and another superfluous object (either a cube or a sphere, i don't remember which) in it.  The arrow points to the exit, although there is no reason for it to do so.  It is a 1x1 room with no hidden areas.  These object add nothing and hinder nothing.  They look like artifacts left over from game design.  (Although as I tupe this one, I once again wonder if I have missed something).

Neither of these are game hindering, but since you invited "small graphic glitches" I thought I'd point them out for the obsessive compulsive perfectionist game developers on your staff.

reggie @ 11/20/2001 7:21:55 PM (989):
I'm a clanner and I don't hear the channels when out of the city, altho I have tried "can anyone hear me?" and got answers. They were maybe in the same playfield?

What is strange is when I'm in Athen the channel seems to flow, but when I'm in Newland I hear a few messages, not far from as many as when I'm in Athen.

I understand the need to limit access to these channels a bit, because otherwise they would be too spammed, but quite often conversations break out in these channels (because we don't have any other chat channels) and then it's a little silly knowing that many might hear only what I say and not what the other part of the chat is saying.

"mm... do you really think so?
oh... ok, I didn't realize.
so what your saying is it gives a bonus to MatMet ?
oh ok , I get it.

Krneki @ 11/20/2001 7:54:53 PM (1156):
a) Yea i noticed that. When you zone u get a fresh bot, not trimmed and not buffed...tabula rasa. Really annoying if you want to buff yer bot b4 you enter the mission area.

b)It sems that something is wrong with human NPCs. It seems everything with high min dmg seems to hit them almost as normal. That includes pets which have very high min dmg.

Borrace @ 11/20/2001 8:13:42 PM (Timeline on a fix please? 1177):
I have looked through the prelim build notes for 13.2 and didn't see a "fix" for the ultra-human type mob bug that seems to make missions impossible since 13.0.

Any chance, funcom, that you could possibly tell your player base:

1)  was this intentional?
2)  if not, when is it going to be fixed?
3)  or...you don't know but will get us an answer within X amnt of time?

there is no point to playing right now if you are in need of equipment.  you can't raise money because missions take way too long, and many of the vending machines at stores are simply empty so you couldn't spend the money anyways.

please fix this, and please give a response.

Virre @ 11/20/2001 9:29:12 PM ("Starting attack failed.." 1183):
I get that message a lot when I am out hunting...

It started after the 13.0 patch and it seems simmilar to the "Take it Easy" message.

It occurs when I fight in teams and have 4-5 MOB's attacking at once and I press the "Q" to attack.. it works fine, the mob dies, THEN I get 7-8 messages on my screen saying "Starting attack failed" I have not done anything after I first pressed "Q" to attack the first time... If I select a new target and press "Q" again, it usually works after I see the message a couple of times and my char starts to attack. I am a lvl 30 MA on Rubi-Ka 2.

Has anyone else experienced this, or perhaps know what causes it?

JFlack @ 11/20/2001 9:30:27 PM (Bugs and a few workarounds. 1184):
Here are several bugs I've encountered playing AO and a few workarounds:

1.) Bug (since 13.0): Can't use health boost kits or nano boost kits.  
Occurance: Frequently after combat, usually after manually reloading a weapon.  
Workaround: Switch to the 3rd person view (F8), then use the mouse pointer to target your character.  Usually this fixes the problem (until the next combat).  Using F1 to select yourself does not work.

2.) Bug (maybe): Using 'nano finger of strength reduction' affected self but not MOB.
Occurance: During combat, targeted MOB, used finger --> lowered my character's stat!  Ouch.  Tried a couple of times with same result.
Workaround: Don't know of any

3.) Bug: Tried using 'shift + left click' to view a MOB in a mission (not in combat) --> my character immediately died and was teleported back to Reclaim Terminal.  Ouch!  
Workaround: Don't do that!

4.) Bug: Attacking MOB results in 'Take it easy ...' message.
Occurance: Seen this one on several posts.
Workaround: Zoning out of the area then back in caused this to stop (at least for me and one other player I know).

5.) Bug: Can't stack/combine ammo.
Occurance:  Have 4-5 slots taken up by energy ammo in Inventory, but can't seem to stack them up into a single combined stack.  This wastes a lot of limited Inventory space.
Workaround: Placing the ammo into a Bank (or backpack), then back into Inventory would sometimes allow me to combine the ammo by simply drag-n-droping them onto the same location (but not consistently).  Is there a keyboard command that is supposed to do this?

Anybody have any other bug workarounds?  If so, please speak up!!

Borrace @ 11/20/2001 9:31:30 PM (1157):
i agree.

Satherial @ 11/20/2001 10:13:32 PM (556):
The problem for me was never the distance of the mission city wise, but rather location wise. Some of you think that since the mission entrance is one zone away the it's all of a sudden easier to get to and I find that rather amusing.

Before this patch I would get all my missions from omni to clon****. It took me like 20 seconds to grid into clon**** and begin my missions, but the problem was that I would grid in at say 1000.4000 (it's something like that) and have missions for 2000.600. The problem with locations was within the actual map (for me atleast). This problem is still here. Sure I'll get a mission from Lush Hills to clon**** (They're zones connect thus incredbily nerfed cash rewards) but the mission cave is still in 2000.600.

Hopefully that'll give a good explanation.

Barzillai @ 11/20/2001 10:48:28 PM (1183):
Yes...same as the "take it easy" bug -- mechanically.
Cleared it by targetting a member of my team...attempting to attack...then targetting the mob and it was fixed.

Zaal @ 11/20/2001 10:49:45 PM (556):
Zaal agrees.  He cant even get the avalon to Clon**** missions anymore for 40k like he used to - now hes stuck trying to find 20k missions which are noticably closer but the most he can find.

It takes a LONG time to clear one of these dungeons out and it hurts a lot to have all of the mobs be mostly grey now and hit as hard as other greens thru oranges.  I can't even blitz grey mobs as they knock me down hard.  So therefore I have no choice but to fight them and teh mission reward hardly out weighs the money I have to spend on chargers to do the missions.

Therefore.  Bump.

Zaal @ 11/20/2001 11:06:04 PM (Cash or item prizes?  Which would you prefer? 1198):
Me if the mission terminals actually offered me stuff I coudl use or wanted to use I woudl take the mission.  The only reason I NEED a LOT of cash is because the stuff I need for my characters isn't cheap.  If prices were less in stores then I coudl buy the stuff for less and take less cash rewards in missions.  But now sleeves are costing my NT 150k per sleeve.  And sleeves are CHEAP!  If the mission system could be calibrated to give some kind of reward based on our stats (base stats - weapon stats and nanostats) and potential stats as opposed to what our level is then the prize items would make me visit places as opposed to looking for the best cash offer since all i can do is pay extortionist prices for stuff that other people find in missions.  GREED is the driving force behind people selling the stuff they find - they don't want to help their fellow players.  They just want to take our credits and so on.

I used to and sometimes still do give thigns away, and I tend to go the make an offer route and 1k per QL when sellign soemthing.  But if I continue to be as nice as that I will never make Zaal any better.

Misophist @ 11/20/2001 11:19:44 PM (1148):
Sunglasses and tattoos were in the game at release, or I think they were. Then they disappeared. They were very rare, and if you saw somebody wearing them, you knew they were very lucky. Same with tattoos, but they were around longer than sunglasses. I had a really nice arm tattoo after tattoos went poof and lost it to a server drop. And to think, I could have sold it for millions!

Honestly, I am rather glad this stuff was put into the game again! I am not willing to pay millions for tattoos, sunglasses and whatnot. These items serve very little purpose in the game besides making your character look good. It's nice that everybody has the chance to buy them now, rather than just the elite few who could procure them for absurd prices or were blessed to find them on missions. (A few people got Katara shades back in the day as mission rewards. )

I had a pair of kataras during beta and that was sooo cool.

Talys @ 11/20/2001 11:27:58 PM (556):
If they just doubled all the misison rewards (for any given distance), I think everybody would be a lot happier, and the game economy would still be very well balanced .

The best balance, I think, would be if an "average distance" mission gave lvl * 1000 credits (ie level 30 mission = 30k, level 50 mission = 50k).   With the increased grouping requirements (read: harder game), the money is divied up more ways now anyhow.

Valerian @ 11/20/2001 11:41:50 PM (1183):
I just had a strange experience too. single player mission. no mob in room just a chest. I open chest and its a bomb. 
Chat window says "A rollerrat awakes!" There is now a "frightened rollerrat" walking around in the room. I try to attack and get: "You cannot attack your pet! Starting attack failed"
I then tried a few pet commands but got no response from the mob   
2 rooms further I got the exact same story with a chest...
Could not attack the rats and they didnt attack me either. If this is supposed to be a new feature I'd like to now what the idea was when they put that in.

Hossley @ 11/21/2001 12:28:03 AM (Poor Susan Furor... 1217):
Susan lives in Poole, in Galway County. She's at a little outpost behind the Mantzees pyramids and she lives all alone...

Now if it wasn't bad enough scratching a living near those bloodthirsty abberations, she's now become a target for opportunistic Clanners taking advantage of Boss Ross's generosity to go and play "see how many times an hour we can send her to reclaim".

She is red to me at Lv64, but has no Omni protection and a very high respawn rate.

Why doesn't Mr Ross give her some backup? Or why doesn't she learn not to turn up back there so often?

It's hardly a great balance between risk and reward 

Cheers,

Hoss.

Mriswith @ 11/21/2001 12:39:33 AM (Doctors Outfit & Zoning problem 1219):
I have noticed an odd problem when playing my Character Mozleron (Rubikai 1) , a Lvl 8 Doc.
Last night i purchased most of the items for the Doctors outfit...
-Omni-Med Suit Skirt (+10/+10)
-Omni-Med Female Suit Shirt(+20/+20)
-Omni-Med Suit Boots(+6/+6)
-Omni-Med Suit Sleeves(+14/+14)
-Omni-Med Suit Gloves(+10/+10)

Base First Aid - 52
Base Treatment - 53
Modified FA - 112
Modified Treat - 113
Modified numbers are what shows up after i put all listed items above one before zoning.

As soon as i zone, the numbers come up as follows.

Base FA - 42
Base Treat - 23
Modified FA - 102
Modified Treat - 83

Obviously not what they should be.  As soon as i zone not wearing the Doc outfit, the base numbers come back to what they should be, but its a pain in the neck to have to totaly undress, zone, then dress again just to get the proper stat bonus...

Hopefully this will be addressed and fixed in good time...

Krystka @ 11/21/2001 1:17:31 AM (Mission locations still not showing up.  Please read. 1221):
The missions do work great now BTW.  That is not an issue anymore from what I can tell.   

But there is still a problem.    I used to get missions all over depending on which terminal I went to.   I have gone to every terminal possible for an Omni employee to browse at ;  yes even borealis;  and both Varmint Woods and Aegean do not show up as mission locations anymore.   These are the two places I always used to go;  since they offered a great reward usually.    

Is this going to be fixed or was it lost in the wash?

Please advise.

Kohistan @ 11/21/2001 1:34:18 AM (My toons diary. (comments welcome - but no flames please :) 1226):
Finally my player logged in today - He had a lot of work to do, so it got rather late before he could log-in and we could go doing stuff here on Rubi-ka.
After we had said hello to the other Guild mates we headed over to a mission terminal to see if we could get a mission with some good lewt - and maybee a bit of cash.. the cash flow has been somewhat small after the people who give me missions started cheating me, and made me go all the way to a mission - Slaughter everything inside and then CHEAT me for my reward. But I think my former mission assign people has been canned, seems like im getting my payment as agreed now.
Man.. But the new mission assigners are so happy with cloth and nanos.. they try to offer me endless stacks of Miiir outfit and nanos that I as a fixer cant even use. 
Finally after allmost 7k of mission camping we found a mission were the lewt was a good armor - could be soled for  50-60k when we would return from the mission. plus that the money reward was 20k - nice thing..

As I entered Newland to drive the rest of the way to the mission.. It was like someone had put me down in a bowl of jelly - I couldnt hardly move.. and I was seeing the world like a slideshow - Suddenly I could no longer feel the presence of my player.. Sadly that has happend a lot - like he just dissapears and 3-4 mins later its like he is relogging the world.. strange.
Well - the world cleared up and we could move again.. We were off to the mission.. I got into my car_ damn crap model I have bought me here.. It takes 10 seconds! for the cockpit door to open so I can get in. (Must remember to take it to the Car repair and ask if something wrong with the thingy that opens to the interior).
Oh and now we are at the strange things part dear diary - I think I had something stolen form my apartment yesterday, so odd - they stole a lot of stuff but they were so kind to leave exactly 10 items - they even stole my lava lamp?! - the one grandma gave me.
Well - back to reality. As we reached the mission we got inside the cave (Another borring thing in my life - I think that the mission assigners hate me. they allways gives me borring caves, were I have to shoot all the people inside, Its getting rather sad as I used 6 years on Rubi-ka University to learn how to hack and now Im forced to do missions that even an Atrox soldier can do).
When we stepped inside the next room - 3 nanocasters attacked me - I fire my burst.. 112 dmg!?!! - I used a lot of creds on this ql 100 mausser, and it cant even hit. Im getting the fealing that the gun salesman ripped me off when I bought it. Maybee He tampered with the description of the Quality Level.
Well - I could just kill one of the NT's and had to flee the cave. But after  3-4 tryes I finally had them all 6 feet under. 
Well dear diary u know the drill - we slaughtered our way through the cave for 90 minuttes killing, killing, killing.. (Remind me to get a new appointment with the shrink - Im getting very concerned that all this slaughtering is the main reason for those damn nightmares I have when sleeping)
After 90 minuttes in the mission - Offcourse I ran Out of Combat first aids.. With still a lot of mission rooms left - me and my player simply decided that we had killed enough and just wanted that damn fine armor and money that was the reward (It wasnt even an assasination mission - we were ordered to find an item and bring it back home) - So I buffed up my run speed and started running through the last 10-15 rooms left, getting all sorts of enemys on my tale - hehe.. I thought at that time they are not hitting me. And we found the thing.. wepooo.. We found it finally..! - dear diary can u imagine my surprise when I found out that the item was glued to the freaking ground !! - Yes sir, I couldnt pick it up.. It was just staying on the ground as I was trying to pick it up. My player was screaming at me to hurry because enemys were getting awefully close and personally.. But no luck - I simply couldnt take it off the ground - My communication channels wasnt even displaying any errors.. It just didnt move. Well With half my health left we decided to get out of there. I took the first step in to the next room - And suddenly I woke Up at the reclaim.. killed with over half of my health left.. Like god took Out his .44 and put an end to my misery.

This world isnt fair to me - I have worked hard as a loyal member of the clans, done my share of work to get our small community running. I have even helped out newcommers so that they would feel welcome and appreciated - AND STILL I get killed with over half my health left, my work isnt easy when I cant pick items off the ground. My mausser dosnt work.. nothing works - I should never have come to Rubi-ka.. I should have stayed home at earth together with grandma.

Dear diary - After yet another failed attempt for my player to have some fun - he decided to log off. Its funny because when he started, he was on Rubi-ka all the time and we had a lot of fun despite the problems it is clear that Rubi-ka has. But as time has gone by (and not much have changed to the world), I have noticed that it is not the happy player that used to guide me around, but it has become more and more often that he logs in - And hopes that things can go smooth - But he allways gets dissapointed, and I am so worried that one day I will not see him any more.

So now I sit here all by mysellf on a small hill outside Tir, looking at the moons - wondering if this planet ever will be a nice place to live. Goodnight diary...

Zerosignal @ 11/21/2001 1:38:34 AM (Cannot Switch Weapons with total mirror sheild up...... 1227):
Funcom can you fix this extremly annoying bug, i know of any other nanos that cause your weapon.
I believe it has to do with the long recharge time of the Nano skills in operative de-buff that is cast with the total mirror sheild, to prevent chain casting.

If you look at the In-Game stats on the Nano skills in operative you will notice that it has an extremly long recharge time, this maybe what is interfering with switching weapons.

Test it yourself funcom.

They haven't been global since beta.  We've pestered Funcom for global chat since then and their response was to add the useless per-zone channels.  IIRC, there were a couple of days when there were some chat bugs that permitted broader chat briefly, but there weren't any patches where it could be counted on.

Fizzel @ 11/21/2001 2:23:06 AM (Help, My pets cant swim!! 1234):
Since this last patch (13.0) my Pets can't seem to make it
across the rooms with the deeper water. It seems to 
happen more often with my healing pet, she gets out into the
middle and just stays there. Also complicating the problem, is the 
fact that she can no longer heal me if the door is shut or if the
graphics show it "blinking" or "mirroring". I've been killed twice
today, lost 31k exp first mission and 43k the second, both due to
fact my pets were "stuck". I am a MP, lvl 56. I love being a MP, but we count on our pets, like Enforcers count on there weapon, try fighting in a misson without your weapon and you will understand. The pathing was suppose to be better with this patch. Well.. they keep up better outside but path worse inside 

Please Help!

Thanks, Fizzel

Darkblood @ 11/21/2001 2:28:23 AM (1184):
1.) Bug (since 13.0): Can't use health boost kits or nano boost kits. 
Occurance: Frequently after combat, usually after manually reloading a weapon. 
Workaround: Switch to the 3rd person view (F8), then use the mouse pointer to target your character. Usually this fixes the problem (until the next combat). Using F1 to select yourself does not work. 


...sometimees targetting the door then myself again (without going to 3rd person) helps. When that doesn't stand sit stand sit while slamming cancel key (ie. cancelling target) a few times. This ****s me midcombat cause health stims wont work. Hitting escapes kills you attack as well as targetting so gives mobs few more extra hits on you ;-/



2.) Bug (maybe): Using 'nano finger of strength reduction' affected self but not MOB. 
Occurance: During combat, targeted MOB, used finger --> lowered my character's stat! Ouch. Tried a couple of times with same result. 
Workaround: Don't know of any 


...noticed this wayyyyyyyyyyyy back and is the reason why I just sell these things instead of tryign to use them.


3.) Bug: Tried using 'shift + left click' to view a MOB in a mission (not in combat) --> my character immediately died and was teleported back to Reclaim Terminal. Ouch! 
Workaround: Don't do that! 


...ta didn't notice this.

4.) Bug: Attacking MOB results in 'Take it easy ...' message. 
Occurance: Seen this one on several posts. 
Workaround: Zoning out of the area then back in caused this to stop (at least for me and one other player I know). 

...same here. zoning fixces this. this was *supposed* to be fixed a few patches back. Seems it has been reintroduced. Same with rediculous mob AC, MOB attack speed, and a few other things.


5.) Bug: Can't stack/combine ammo. 
Occurance: Have 4-5 slots taken up by energy ammo in Inventory, but can't seem to stack them up into a single combined stack. This wastes a lot of limited Inventory space. 
Workaround: Placing the ammo into a Bank (or backpack), then back into Inventory would sometimes allow me to combine the ammo by simply drag-n-droping them onto the same location (but not consistently). Is there a keyboard command that is supposed to do this? 


....aye. putting the extra ammo into a backpack, then left clicking it to hold it, place it in the inventory ONTO another object in your main inventory (ie. effectively swapping what you are holding) sometimes automatically stacks ammo/health stims etc.




....6.) Sometimes you just don't attack during fighting. Jumping sometimes resolves this.
Yet another one that was supposedly fixed a few patches back but somehow has been reintroduced.

Coldstrike @ 11/21/2001 2:47:01 AM (1227):
Yup, very annoying bug. I hate it when I use my mirror shield as a last resort, only to find out that I'm stuck wielding my flashpoint isntead of my nova. If I'm lucky I can get off 2-3 shots for the duration of the shield when that happens. Not much help in that..

i'm a martial artist so i thought i'd try the blue zenith tachi i found. I equipped it and for a few minutes it worked like it was supposed to. You do sword and fist attack. However, after a few minutes i was only doing sword attack, which is considerably lower than my fist attack. Then when i unequipped the sword, i couldn't attack at all...just stood there taking damage. The bug doesn't clear until you die, or /terminate. Then you can use your fists again.

Holinor @ 11/21/2001 4:36:42 AM (1233):
Or when you are in team combat, trying to heal people while seeing Nano drop like a dead fruitfly, throwing yourself to your knees to get new nano and.. No sorry, too low treatment, you can die, I do not have any nano left.

KiaLium @ 11/21/2001 5:20:40 AM (1244):
I've noticed this as well. Fists stop working under the following conditions:

1. Your MA skill changes (buff,debuff)
2. You unequip the sword in the middle of a fight
3. You zone with the weapon equiped.

One way I have found to fix this for me is to unequip the sword and zone. Always unequip when zoning or buffing and it helps with the problem a bit.

Here is another thread dealing with this same issue:

Frustration @ 11/21/2001 6:03:09 AM (Floating in cave missions 1253):
This bug comes and goes for me sometimes not showing up at all during a patch sometimes all the time.  THe problem is in cave style missions, especially ones with water in the main room.  As soon as I try to enter it I slowly start floating upwards.  My poor character twitchs and spasms as I try to get her feet back on the ground.  After a few seconds of random jumping she'll sink back to the floor.  

This is pretty irritating when some Mobs have it in for you.  Oh look they can shoot me and I can...fly....

I know its's not just me because my friend experiences the same thing.

Stupid bugs...must crush

Konril @ 11/21/2001 6:03:21 AM (Bad missioning experince: Opponents heal way too fast. 1254):
I just had a very unpleasent mission experience today in Newland Desert.

I am a just 49th level fixer.  I got the mission from Avalon (Camelot) at 50% "even" difficulty.  I was fortunate to be able to clear 5 various green soldiers from the mission, and entered a room with a big yellow soldier.  The fight started not good, My mausser was hitting him for 30, while he was firing at me for 59 a shot.  This in itself was not a serious problem.  The serious problem was the fact I literally couldn't get him below 50% health.  Between my Falsify Medical Records, and popping QL 50 first aid kits once a minute, the soldier was literally healing as fast as I was, without any visible assistance, and without crossing the zone entrance to the mission area.

Usually when NPC opponents start doing that kind of damage to me I have to resort to hit and move tactics to give my HoT time to work.  I would fire at the target once or twice, run around the nearest pillar or into the next room for two or three ticks of the HoT, and reengage.  Up to now, this has worked fine for me (as long as I'm not facing an Enforcer or other melee-mob who can attack on the move) however this time, it just plain failed.  In spite my best efforts.  The soldier's hit points simply would not go below 50%.  It was as if the second I moved, the solder would start his non-combat healing.

I did have to take it to the zone three times during the combat.  It seems I was able to confuse the soldier for a few seconds with my hit-and-run, and the soldier three times during the battle took off in a tangent straight off my radar.  However when the soldier came back and I tried to re-engage, I got hit with the dreaded "Take it easy" message.  I had to zone out and back in to continue the attack.  Each time, in spite being gone less than 20 seconds, the soldier was able to go from 50% hit points, to 75% hit points.

I hate to say it, but if this is now normal behaviour, my fixer is plain SOL.  I eventually got fed up, and blitzed the mission.  I just could not defeat this thing, even in spite it being even with my level. I woke up at the reclaim terminal with a token for my efforts.  But this was really frustrating.

Ashuras @ 11/21/2001 6:13:27 AM (1254):

[from the diary of Spdyr]

Dear Diary, today I noticed something odd...my actions were about six seconds behind my thoughts.  Very annoying.  The most annoying thing was my brain said one thing, and the world said another, so I couldn't even try to adjust for this delay, because my nanocontroller kept telling me I was already running a program.  I know that if I try to do anything, there is a six second delay, but the part of my mind that runs my nanocontroller doesn't seem to grasp that..so I have to wait an added six seconds to try to run another formula.  Go Figure.

Dear Diary,  I'm still getting the six-second delay for some reason, and now my eyes seem to be studdering.  Unless I look strait at the ground, the world seems to skip rather than the smooth transition I had before.  Perhaps I should have them replaced?  Aside from that, I had a great time fighting robots that are also affiliated with Omni-Tek, that for some reason, decide I'm a valid target.  I guess the programmers don't like nanomage nanotechnitions.  Go Figure.

Dear Diaray, I just recieved word that the R&D team from Omni-Tek developed or discovered (or stole) a new method of matter transportation and a new forcefield.  Unfortunatly, through all my searching, I have yet to even meet another nanotech that has seen the forcefield.  On the bright side, it'll only cost me an arm and a leg to be able to teleport back to Rome when I want.  Good thing the Grid is free!  I heard that nanotechs were going to get a tremendous boost, but instead we got an expensive substitute for the grid.  Go Figure.

Dear Diary,  I just found out that the Clanner Scum have developed a new method of protecting themselves from Faithful Omni-Tek employees in battle.  It seems to cut all damage in half!  Good thing the R&D team from Omni-Tek ...researched the new method, and reproduced it, thus protecting Faithful Omni-Tek employees in a similar way during combat.  Well, I did the math, and I figured out that I will be totally exhausted after a minute and a half of combat.  During which (if they dont' do anything), I have an infetesimal chance at killing them.  I love mathematical impossibilites.  Go Figure.

Dear Diary, I just found out that the I.C.C. (also refered to as 'Funcom' for some reason I can't figure out) is releasing the blueprints for all sorts of constructed items at an incredible rate!  I tried to make a nanocrystal so I could share my latest program with a friend, and found out that there was now way to copy programs from my memory onto the storage medium of crystals.  Not only that, but I'd have to sell an arm and a leg in order to pay for the raw materials to make the crystal, much less imbed the program into it.  Go Figue.

Maximilian @ 11/21/2001 10:18:31 AM (1270):
Hi Ripper.

I have the following observation, that might explain the non functional manual loading.

I am a gunslinger. One of my two pistols has a 'rather' low ammo capacity (Desert Reet;16). To not get interrupted for my specials (3 flings and 2 bursts excatly fit in one ammo clip) I reload manually after 'each' fight (if possible).
I have recognized, that only when the actual ammount of ammo is smaller then 13 (12-) the manual reload works, otherwise the clip is regarded as full by the system. And I only get the fully loaded message when there are 16 rounds in the pistol. So there seems to be a 'buffer' zone, in which the manual reload is blocked, because the system considers the gun 'fully' loaded.

I can only speak for some pistols, which I observed this phenomen for.

So long,

Max(imilian)

I've experienced both of those, and they are both very annoying.  The looting bug can sometimes be fixed by zoning then zoning back, a tedious process to get one MOBs loot, and you have to be fast to get back to the body before it decays.

Ok ok ok!

My engineer is running into Uber NPC's now in missions that seem to ONLY be hittable for minimum dmg.  This makes for some really long battles.  I made a list and grabbed what they conned so I could post it here.

Rookie OT Marksman      GREEN         -0---+-----
Rookie OT Hunter            YELLOW      -----0-----
Rookie OT Gridcourier     ORANGISH   -----+--0---
Rookie OT Techhunter     YELLOW      -----0-----
Novice Sharpshooter       RED            -----+----0
Novice Contract Killer      RED             -----+----0

The following were NOT super and could be hit for varying amounts fo dmg.

Novice Bothacker         yellow              -----0-----
Rookie OT Secretary    yellow orange  -----+-0---
Novice Programthief    green yellow    ----0+-----

This list is compiled from ONE mission only and the only disturbing trend here is the class vulnerability that it seems to be based on. If this isn't a bug as I hope it is, then this clearly shows that the soldier, agent, adven, and fixer classes to be the ones to play if you want power, and clearly shows the others to be the dump classes. 

This HAS to be a bug.  Note the lower level mobs that I COULDN'T hit for more than minimum.  If its NOT a bug coudl someone explain why this happens??  Thanks.

I checked the stores and found 2 new SMGs construction manuals.

Michael PAtriot FFi 29A and Cheap Aleph . (thet may not be new but i just found them)

I startedthe quest to find the parts and got all of them , (i know how to make weapons , with the QL requierements and SKill reqs and so on)

SO i seeked and found an engineer and tried to make him assemble the guns. .... IMPOSSIBLE i thought "geez that gy suck"

i logged my almighty ubergimped soldier (with tradeskills , dont smile plz). I bought new pieces and try to assemble them. guess what , it is IMPOSSIBLE. If u dont have skill high enough u get a message as usual, but if u do have enough skill nothing happen !!!the construction kits and the parts arent assembled ! 

i tested on a regular rifle just to check out and it worked. Seems to be on SMGs only. I read that there was a problem on those kits but i thought they were solved ...)


any idea or eta on a fix ???

Mascot @ 11/21/2001 3:44:04 PM (1042):
They definitely changed the line of sight and aggro code a lot in the last patch. I'm getting a lot of hassle from mobs in nearby rooms that come running the second I pick a chest (in an empty room no less).

I'm pretty sure it's in fact a line of sight bug. FC fixed it so you don't  have line of sight through closed doors, but somehow managed to give mobs line of sight through walls at times instead. Another funny thing is I draw aggro from nearby rooms easier when picking a lock than if dealing with a mob in my room. How's that for logical. I make more noise picking a lock than I do taking down a mob?

The server-side lag is nothing new. FC has never said anything about it as far as I can recall, and probably never will.

Toser Ban @ 11/21/2001 4:16:38 PM (1326):
When exactly did that happen to you?

I'm asking because I just did a mission in Galway shire (after the patch of today), encountering EXACT the same MOBs (except the Novice ones) and had no problem at all.

This was the first mission I did with human MOBs after I read about the problems they should give. Before I did some with monsters and was behaving (i.e. damage dealing) as usual.

If they haven't fixed anything, then maybe I have no problems because I'm using a Khemotech pistol (QL40ish), which does radiation damage, and the low damage dealing bug only hits people dealing standard damage types... Well, just guessing.

A word on that problem by FC would be helpful anyway!

Dhurdahl @ 11/21/2001 4:40:16 PM (1326):
This might sound like a stupid but..

If the mobs have (a pure guess) 10-15 time their level in AC (and using normal armour types).
At lvl 35 then they would lower damage with 35-52 per hit, and for me thats enough to do min almost every time.

Except when they have an armour with bad proj AC, then I do more then min, more like a normal damage span.
Im looking for better guns that do fire or energy damage.

I ONLY do NPC missions, no nonhumanoids at all!

Zaal @ 11/21/2001 5:58:23 PM (1326):
Toser Ban -  it happens exactly like that in every mission I do and these NPCs show up.  the only reason I hit them for 8, 9 , or 10 dmg is because i have a weapon enhancement adding 5 dmg to my hits.  I've seen it wear off and I hit for 3, 4, or 5 with a burst of 9.  It would be funny if it didnt seem so wrong.

The thing of it is the lower level ones.  I hit THEM for min damage?  Even my pet hits lower on these "Uber" NPCs.  But luckily i have good pet so I can usually get by.  But I remember at one point Funcom saying how they want ed battles to be a littel quicker.  Well, they ain't quick no more with the way it is.  I sometimes have to sit there for 5-10 minutes on one mob.  Luckily my pet can handle it but it just seems odd to me.

I think it's the three main damage dealing types who are having problems. Melee, projectile and maybe energy, though I haven't noticed any changes with my level 6 Vektor-wielding trader. Could be because she's low and using a sort of high QL weapon. 

But an advent who uses a gluegun, chem damage, hasn't reported any difference. And hammer users are also faring well. I think that may have something to do with the fact that they can overequip hammers by a lot, and maybe the mob's uber AC just can't withstand that kind of damage. Who knows? I'm curious to see if it is fixed, but since you use a khemo, I'm not too hopeful.

MuscularBeaver @ 11/21/2001 6:33:16 PM (1359):
Yes, and it is very annoying. Got caught by it twice last night. 

Although I must admit I got a good mission last night (50% slider, mostly green MOBs, only 2 chain-healers, nobody cast nanos on me).  That gave me the best gameplay I've had in about 2 months.  The second mission (also 50% slider) was filled with chain healers and nano-casters so I deleted it and went to bed.

reggie @ 11/21/2001 7:13:43 PM (989):
A fully global channel means one that can be heard all over the planet, by players in all 3 factions, clan, neutral and omni.

The trade channels were never global in the wide sense nor within their respective factions (if they were ever global then that must have been before 12.0). They are only being broadcasted to certain playfields. As I clanner I was never able to hear most of the posts in the clan shopping channel when I was in Newland Desert, for example.

Funcom have said that global channels doesn't work because 
1) they want to limit communication between players of different factions and 2) they think that the channels would become too spammed.

I don't want neither a global trade channel nor a global chat channel. 

We  need chat channels that are available only to players within a certain faction, and wherever they are.

And we need several of them.

And FC can remove our access to shopping channels belonging to opposing factions. That is even going against their own statements.

It's a real shame too, this game has such potential for being fun, if it only worked.  Im done fighting with all the hassles ("take it easy" included)  I plan to try and play later on, when they fix more of the "basic" problems that lead to "player rage" (Like road rage, only you get it playing this game).  

Until then, I'll read these boards and wait for the people still beating their heads against the desk playing the game to tell me when its fixed enough to play again.

I have noticed this too, but in a new "fashion". When attacked by two snakes, I *was* able to switch target, but after I did that, my special attack (burst) didn't work. Some message - that I don't remember the full text of - told me, I had to "finish the previous fight first".

MaDezzie @ 11/21/2001 8:18:52 PM (928):
Wasn't exactly sure where to post this (too many posts about missions), but it appeared to be a bug so here goes...

Okay, I thought that FC stated in the patch notes for the mission changes that you could 'guarantee' yourself a token if you did clear out the place of all mobs.

Fine and well, but here's my gripe.

I did a mission today.  Got it in Omni-Entertainment, was a 'grab-item' mission.  It was located in Milky Way.  I get there and go inside.  A total of five rooms.  Every single room was EMPTY.  No mobs, no chests, nothing, except for the item I had to grab.

So of course, no token.

This hasn't just happened to me, I know of others as well that have had this.  One person had two missions in a row just like this.

At my level, missions are hard enough without the extra frustrations.  I'd like to still be able to receive tokens, but this 'guaranteeing' yourself a token doesn't work if the terminals issue missions with empty playfields.

Please fix this.

The fact that yalms, or any other vehicle for that matter, unequip after you zone is a royal pain.  Not just because of lakes, but because of lag and mobs that just love to aggro you while you're still zone lagged and can't move.  I understand that they are supposed to unequip when zoning into a indoor area, missions, shops, etc, but if you're still in the great outdoors, there is no reason it should unequip.

3 other bugs with yalms:

1.  Team heals cause you to fall right out of the sky, and well, fall damage hurts.

2.  Pressing escape to un-target something also makes you crash.  Needless to say I don't dare touch that key when flying.

3.  Auto-follow while in yalms is seriously messed up.  I target someone in a yalm to follow them in my yalm.  Close to impossible.  Why?  Well, the person I'm following appears to dive and then screams back up towards the sky.  So I end up losing them on those wonderful journeys to EFP and DAV.  Here's a typical conversation between myself and teammate:

Me: "hey, quit all the fancy crap, just fly in a straight line"
Them: "dude, you're the one doing the fancy crap, you keep flipping around and diving"

SO!  Is this a graphical bug?    Please fix these, you'd make many pilots happy.

Planes are expensive because they're beneficial, right?  Okay, then fix those very unbeneficial bugs.

I haven't gotten take it easy today, not that I tried hard to get it, but I did get a message like "Please wait until the previous battle is complete" once.  Maybe they changed the text so you don't get "Take it easy" anymore, but this wait until the previous battle is complete was just about the same thing.  Actually worse, since I couldn't attack a monster and even after the monster attacked me I didn't start fighting back.  Even using special attacks couldn't get me out of this bug.  I had to zone to fix it.

Recently, I was doing a mission. In the midst of fighting and killing, I suddenly noticed that I was hitting extremely fast and hard. I had just recently hit lvl50, and maxed up my key skills, but that's still only an increase of 3-5 pr skill. I checked my skills and to my amazement I saw that my melee.init was at 700... it is usually at 220.. I have never owned so hard before... I killed the rest of that mission so easily... took on several orange mobs at once.. when I zoned out in the end, the stat was back at 220.

In my next mission, the same thing happened again, but this time it was my run speed. Just incredible. I laughed a lot about all this in guild chat, none of the others had ever heard about anything like it before. Same thing, when I zoned out my run dropped back to 126 or whatever it is.

After being high coming down is a drag. Funcom u showed me the light and then you took it away from me. :/

I saw that during beta. People just ignore picking the race and use the raw genetic template in character creation. Don't know what advantage this has besides making a spectacle. It must have slipped through the cracks again.

But the floating head thing? Sometimes if I zoom in on my characters too much, their bodies sort of shrivel up and look funky -- I have screenshots somewhere. Maybe that's something similar to that, only makes the body completely disappear?

To reduze file size without converting to jpg which is not suited for computer graphics, and in case the player in concern and other involved characters didn't want their names published.
How very thoughtful of me? Besides, chopping off image edges wouldn't make manipulating any easier. I'm quite good at manipulating, but these images are not. (Except for erasing player name).

wh3lx0r @ 11/22/2001 12:33:29 AM (PvM imbalance: 1404):
If you're a doctor (or other healer) you've probably noticed that since the 13.0 patch, you've been aggroed more than you're used to, often this leads to death.  I've spoken with a few different ARKs about the problem, and all have had the same, consistent answer:  a change in the PvP system caused PvM attacks to decrease in magnitude; therefore, monsters analyze doctors and other healing professions as a larger potential threat.  At times, I'll be aggroed for no reason; other times (in missions) mobs appear from other rooms and through walls to further me to my demise.  

As a doctor, I'm already weak enough.  As a doctor, my hit points aren't stellar compared to other classes.  As a doctor, I can't do jack for damage, even when dual wielding two pistols with a QL higher than my current level.  When multiple red mobs aggro me, I tend to not function well as a "tank".  Obviously, this is something that needs fixing, unfortunately, I haven't seen anything about even adjusting the battle system to accomodate for this problem in the upcoming 13.2 notes.  Please fix me!

Since the fix made on tuesday (guild command fix) I am unable to damage mobs unless the attack is accompanied with a special.
 
 I am a level 95 Enforcer, I use sledghammers, use essence of cyclops, headcracker, and 2hBlunt expertise buffs. I have tried this on every level mob I could find. As I normaly hunt mobs a bit higher than my level (medusa) i decided to test this out on medusa's in DAV, Claws in Pleasant meadows, mobs in every difficulty mission from 1% to 100% mobs in the newbie training grounds, to clan knight gaurds. I have also used three different QL hammers, including my normal hammer (QL 161). All to the same effect. Unless I use brawl the mob will take no damage 9 times out of 10. I have made no changes to my armor or equipment or the way that I fight. This all began after the server side fix for guild commands. I have spoken to a GM and was told that FC would loog my character on to see what the problem might be. I of course was given no timeframe. 

  I have been a huge supporter of FC and AO since beta and all the problems in beta. But this is truely weird. 

 Please reply to this thread if you have been experiencing the same problem. I am at wits end as to what this could be. I have been playing this character since release, and I have no intention of rerolling and starting completely over, not that I havent thought about it. you know the old "i should have done this instead of that routine" But this char is a guild Director and I have too much time wrapped up in his development to scrub the toon.

It also happens when unequipping the weapon during a heal recharge at certain times. The only fix is to re-equip the weapon, use special attack, de-equip it, buff MA, and hopefully that works. From my observations, the client sees no weapon equipped and the server does when this happens.

Build Notes v13.2 (Updated 20.11.01)
General Changes:

***************
Fixed a bug that caused secondary weapons to unequip when switching playfields. Basically, when re-building the character after zoning, weapons were checked before implants were, thus when trying to place the weapon, the implants would not be taken into consideration and you would not meet the requirements.
***************

Fixed a bug that could cause items to disappear.

The level range for monsters in mission dungeons are now calculated differently. You should see an improvement based on the difficulty slider better affecting what monsters are generated in the missions.

Fixed some client crashes.

Cleaned and optimised the ground rendering system in AO.

Sparrow flight no longer drops after zoning.

Monsters should no longer heal each other as frequently as they used to.

The text color of buffs wearing out has been changed to be easier to distinguish from other text messages.

Fixed a server crash.

***************
Yalmahas and Quantum Wings should work properly after zoning.

Spetnov @ 11/22/2001 10:31:13 AM (Drop dead bug and other issues. 1442):
After 13.1 the "drop dead" bug seems to be back with a vengeance. What happens is that you are fighting but don't get any damage messages. Then suddenly you drop dead and find yourself at reclaim. This bug is unacceptable as it greatly disturbs gameplay. 

Another "bug" I have noticed is that the visual range has greatly been decreased. You can only see mobs from like 10 meters away as they suddenly appear out of the game "fog". 
The problem is however that you can not see if there are any "add" mobs around that will aggro . Also dangerous hard hitters that are aggro by nature suddenly seem to pop up . 
This is extremely annoying as well. 

The two above mentioned bugs were experienced in Deep Artery Valley , I am not sure if this is the same on other mobs and areas.

Next are mission mobs . It seems that your damage output against mission mobs is calculated as if it were PvP play.
Therefore missions are sheer impossible.Now missions have been off limits for months but it is time FC really fixes them , making xp per kill greater , handle the token issue for higher levels , implement team missions etc. The way the game is going you will have people maxing levels before the game is half finished with all the IP consequences that gives.

I think that all the characters who does small damages but hits fast are concerned.

My dual mini axes weilding adventurer have troubles with that too. Min damages on some mobs except on crits.

I think that classes with slow weapons which does heavy damages doesn't have the problem, although they probably hit for much less damages as they should.

I'm lvl 102, and there are still plenty of empty chests in missions.  Either that, or they are filled with bullets that sell for like 3 creds.

I am rather pleased by a (silent) change included in the yesterday's patch.

(At least for me) the Newland map is now fully functional, have to test Newland Desert, but I am convinced this one is still fine. I am referring to the Newland Map II from the post before. - Thanks Funcom, whatever you changed, it did the trick (maybe I am just late and it worked since 13.0, but I got aware of it just yesterday).

Some strange things I expierenced yesterday as well [not enough information to call it a bug]:
- A kind of 'line of sight' problem: I get sometimes the message 'Target is out of range' when I want to heal a team mate, although 'the target' is standing only a few meters a side (same room) fighting a mob. On the other side I sometimes can heal through walls without a problem!
- Similar happened while trying to fight a mob. It was in one of bended rooms (secret part with [possible] chest and small pool). I ran into the room to target the NPC, backed out to clear the view and didn't get any attack onto it. Closing in worked finally.

So long,

blu789 @ 11/22/2001 12:08:28 PM (1437):
The game is full of what software developers call "5 minute fixes".

No, 5 minute fixes don't normally take 5 minutes to repair.  Sometimes they take a whole day to figure out even tho at the surface they look like something someone can fix in 5.

However, 5 minute fixes have a unique characteristic about them - they are "perceived" as being minor, easy to fix, and usually are highly visible.

These are the kinds of bugs you usually throw junior / maintenance programmers on.  Why there are so many 5 minute bugs that go unfixed leaves me baffled:

1. Morphing from a plane or animal back into human form selects the wrong texture for tank armor, if your tank armor is not brown.  (i.e. falls back to default tank armor texture).

2. Zoning with omni-pol social armor resets you back to your non-omni pol character, as if you never put it on.

3. Taking off omni pol social armor sometimes leaves your character as if he or she is not wearing any armor at all.

4. Rolling the mouse wheel quickly sometimes causes you to start moving forward.

5. Hitting the Q key (attack) after the flurry of blows effect has worn off (i.e. the cool down & recharge period) sometimes leaves your melee init debuffed by -150 until you zone.

6. Shopping at machines is 1 credit off.  [Rounded / floor() / ceiling() error].

7. Exhaust muscles duration is 10x too long (fixed in 13.2 supposedly).

8. Martial arts "fists" stop working whenever you buff, debuff, or zone with a weapon in your hand.  Probably longer than 5 minutes, but is calling the "rebuild character" function simple enough to fix this problem?

Anyhow, there's lots of examples of this.  I'd rather have as many "5 minute bugs" fixed than being able to sit in chairs.

P.S. Yes, I am a software developer, and yes, I do know what it's like to work on a huge software project with over an actual measured million lines of code.

blu789 @ 11/22/2001 12:15:09 PM (Describe item missions - "described item" is now 25 levels lower instead of 15? 1453):
Hi all,

Nothing major, but an annoyance.

Before I hit level 80, the "object" of a desribe mission was always Q1 (i.e. clothes, minor objects) or 15 levels below the mission level (i.e. level 75 mission = level 60 item).

I hit level 80 when the 12.9 patch came out.  Now that describe item missions work again in 13.0, I have found that the describe item is now *25* levels below.

So where previously, my level 79 character would find quality 64 stuff (i.e. sempai cloaks), my level 80 character now finds quality 55 stuff.

Is this the way it has always been for level 80 characters?  Or did they reduce the quality level of the "describe object" since the 13.x patch?

I too get alot of empty chests at lvl23. And it seems to me that no-locked chests are always empty, cant really remember if I've gottten anything from them... and It's very rare to get anything useful from the chests.
I really hope they will fix this soon 'cus it's not fun getting like you said: bullets even at my level playing a MA.

Tegan @ 11/22/2001 1:35:18 PM (Please fix chain-healing npc's! 1464):
I was happy to see that this issue was addressed and supposedly fixed - and dismayed to find npc's chain-healing like there's no tomorrow (which I suppose for them - there isn't - but that's no excuse).

I have just spent the last 25 minutes trying to kill 2 orange npc's (Clan huntsmen) in a mission in Omni-E.  I'm a level 33 doctor and even while chain-healing & first-aiding myself I cannot make any headway on killing these npc's.  They heal themselves and each other with no end in sight.  They are essentially invincible - this has made missioning impossible again.

Please fix asap!

Thank you,
Tegan

I am not sure if this is any help BUT.....

sometimes i sit and try and healmyself, or increase my nano pool and i get a u cannot do that even though I am sitting and have myself selected.

I beleve other people have this problem and zone to solve it, however i have a work around!

press ESC to deselect yourself, go to external view and click on yourself (dont hit F1).... then try again, you may need to stand up and sit again.

Anyhoo works for me, so givit a try

Maximilian @ 11/22/2001 3:17:47 PM (1470):
And in case this doesn't work - happened once to me - perform a small nano on yourself. This somehow removes the block as well.

Toser Ban @ 11/22/2001 3:26:01 PM (1464):
Well, I think they fixed the chain-healing already. 

If you remember the old-fashioned way MOBs were regenerating (aka chain-healing themselves), then you must definitely see the difference nowadays. Of course, MOBs are still healing themselves (if they are able to), but nowhere as fast as earlier, and they give up after a few heals (probably because they run out of nano engergy).

What does make a difference is when you encounter two or more of the MOBs with healing capabilities at the same time. Then they begin not only to heal themselves, but also to heal one another. In that situation fights become really tough, at least for me. Fortunately, I'm a 'crat, and can have one attacked by my pet and another attacked by myself, in which case they don't heal each other that much. And if all goes worng, I can calm one or more of them to give me some relieve...  

Anyway, from my perspective I don't think chain-healing has re-appeared again. Fight against multiple MOBs with healing capabilities ought to be tough, especially if they are higher in level then you.

Actually, you might be accidentally pressing it. Button 3 is "forward" by default.

JLucy @ 11/22/2001 4:29:53 PM (whats going on with missions today ? 1486):
1 or 2 problems I've had today.

1. Cannot enter mission area in 4Holes
2. Newland - Completed mission, never got token or reward

Whats most enoying is the time spent completing or running to mission area and not get any reward for it - thats what kills me, my time is valuable enough without spending good gameing time for nothing.

Xombie @ 11/22/2001 5:45:33 PM (1486):
Could you give more info?
What mission types were they?
What terms were they from?
ect., etc.

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 5:53:53 PM (1486):
I have reported a bad mission in Holes in the Wall several times over the past few months and it never gets fixed.  Easy to find, hit the Bronto Burger stand in Holes and head straight east until you hit the zone.  Then look for the first possible mission site (black area) and that is it!  Of course, once you zone the mission is no longer available.

There was another I reported in Holes a couple of times, it's along the northwest embankment across from the Bronto.  Try as you might you can't get in to it, you just bounce off it.

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 6:27:31 PM (More on missions. 1499):
Please see if the programming group can quickly make single player missions possible.  I would think my suggestion as to using the mission terminals to allow users to individually tailor missions is still a good one.

On the Rubi-Ka 2 server I took two missions today, used the Borealis terminal and took two in West Stret.  Neither has a pay-out even close to 3K.  In both I moved the main slider 4 clicks to the right and the Good/Bad 4 clicks to the right.  I used to go half way on each.  Now I am unable to complete either mission with a level 29 Fixer (Icaria).

In one there is an orange MOB that double hits me for 28 each, or 56 points of damage to each of my 13 point hits.  Mind you this sane weapon hits grays and greens for 40+ points on the average.  After expending hundreds of rounds and running out of healing kits I had no choice but to bail.

In the second I was attacked by two orange robots and they hit me in the 40's while I hit them in the low teens and there is no way I can complete that mission as since the missions were changed it's almost impossible to pull just one at a time.  In fact, in the first mission I had to get through three green and three grey before I could even get in to the main room.

Are you increasing the armor and hit points the MOBs in a mission have at the same time?  I used to be able to work through single missions without these problems, now I can't even complete a mission.  And if I take really low missions I get low exp points and will never get to the next level.

Please make the missions attainable while allowing a decent reward.  We had this before and others whined it was too easy.  Instead of telling them how to use the mission terminals to make it more difficult you made it difficult for everyone.  Please be aware the "you" is a group term for Funcom, not blaming you personally.  <smile>

I no longer know what to do, I can't enjoy the game the way it is but I really want to play the game!  And I now get no replies to my messages so I don't know if my input is of any value or if it is being ignored.

Do you have any suggestions as to how I can make this "experience" better?

Any help will be appreciated.

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 6:32:28 PM (1486):
Copied from email:

Also, I have sent a couple of /petitions and email reports about broken missions.  The one that s most prevalent is in Holes in the Wall at 1305.5, 612.6.  After the last patch I figured that one would be fixed so my son and I both surfed and got missions there.  After the trip there from Athens we found the mission is still on the wrong side of the zone.  I can get to it but when I do the key is not recognized as it is no longer a mission on the map.

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 6:35:43 PM (1486):
Copied from e-mail:

Please pass this on to the team.  I took two missions in Holes in the Wall at the same time from a mission terminal in Athens.  The first was at 239.8, 1475.8 and I cannot get to that mission.  I bounce off the entrance, no matter what angle I try.  No error message, just can't get in to the entrance.  The second was, again, at 1304,5, 612.6 and I still can't get to it.  When I tried the in game bug report the program locked up on me.  Tried it twice and it locked up and did not appear to send the report.

At lvl 32, the find item is 21... 11 lvls less

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 6:43:46 PM (Mission Suggestions 1500):
Instead of trying to please them asses, errr, sorry, that's "please the masses", would it be better to tweak the mission machines to allow all players to select their own destiny?

The main difficulty slider could be changed to "close / distant". That would select the distance to the mission.  The other internal sliders are good to go if tweaked to work.  Maybe add one called "entrance difficulty" or whatever and let it select the difficulty of getting in to the mssion and would determine the numver of MOBs a player would face to get in to the mission.

Then use the combination to assign mission choices, pay-outs and prizes for completion.

Another suggestion would be to allow the mission goal to be picked up at any time but to not give a token until the mission is completed.  In other words, if all MOBs are not downed when the player leaves the mission then there is no token.  Of course, the ability to store the map would make this unnecessary as the problem is losing the map if leaving to heal.

siriuslea @ 11/22/2001 6:44:26 PM (1326):
I had a mission today south of Newland near the west end of Newland lake in a cave. 
 
I'm an lvl 32 agent, I set all sliders to 50%.  In the first room was an OT Biologist: he had a shield that did chemical damage. I snuck past him by hitting sneak very quickly when I appeared in the room.  He was yellow to me.  I snuck into the second room (big cave room with fireplace) and made a quick u turn into a third room.  There another OT Biologist aggroed me. Adding a few other MOBs to the fight, so I ran for the door.  I got out and proceeded to heal and come back.  

On return I found  just both Biologists in the first room.  There was no way (after 4-5 tries) I could resneak without having my sneak broken so I tried fighting. My health was almost gone after the two mobs hit me a total of 4 times (Both yellow).  I knew I was in trouble cause they  were out hiting me for each hit and I know they have more HP than I.  I have 3 rifles between LVL 42-46, tsaka, dissaf, and gripo.  I tried them all but I was still out damaged with every shot (I was hitting 5-35 and they were hitting twice 26 and 66 chemical between every one of my hits)

I could zone into the room and zone straight out again, half of my 615 hps would be gone.

So I called a friend to help me, lvl 39 Fixer weilding a ql54 or so Mausser.  The two Mobs were green to him , together we could only get one down to 2/3 heath before we had to zone even if he had a continuous HoT running. I didn't ever get past the first room in this mission.  Any advice?

Is this a bug, all the missions with human mobs last night were not like this.

PS the mission prize was a top from Miir and 2500 or so credits

Icaria @ 11/22/2001 6:48:48 PM (1254):
I was beginning to take it personally when my Fixer took on three missions and had to axe all three.  Missions are just no longer any fun at all.  Never before have I spent three or four hours with neglible gains in experience and getting to the next level is looking like anunattainable goal.

See my other posts for more.

I'm all for team play but it almost appears as it will be the ONLY way to play instead of being an option.

Borox @ 11/22/2001 7:15:46 PM (1270):
Seems like some of this bug is weapon dependant, I have a  lower level (22)  soldier that uses a combination of two or three
weapons, a steiner assault lazer to open, an e- beamer and sometimes a nova flow to finish up close. It is very rare for the nova or e-beamer to not manually reload, but extremely common with the steiner. It will fail to reload probably two thirds of the time. I started with a ql 8 steiner, and now use a ql 36 and this has happened with every one of them. I have also used other lazers and plasma shooters like the westinghouse, and icc flashpoint, and have had the same problem with all of them.

A Flame, but not quite so mindless.
I have lost..the past 2 days...6 million experience, or 10 hours of game time to your..."bug"...I believe its caused by the "speed patch" you created.   I know this, but now I can't uninstall the stupid thing.  I am not sure *if* you realize this, but, losing 10 HOURS...10....HOURS of play time over two days is ridiculous.  THe GM I petitioned said "How do I know your not lieing?" when I enquired about returning the lost experience to me.  
I knew he would not return it to me, they never do. The main reason being player fraud is very common.  I have lost 10 hours of time I could have spent doing something else.  I am angry, I have every right to be.  

My question is, HOw do I uninstall that wretched speed patch of yours?

My other question is this, on your list of fixes I don't see anywhere listed your fixing this insta kill bug.  

My final question, on the same topic,pardon the language but I think its rightly phrased and you people very well deserve the criticism, "LIsten you god damn stupid hairy assed mother ****ers, why don't you get off your ass and fix these stupid bugs that repeatedly kill players instead of wasting resources on minor bugs that don't do diddly squat. Why the **** should I waste $30 a month on this friggin game only to lose playing time and only get even more angry, if I wanted to pay $30 to get dicked around I'd go....at lesat find a cheap whore to do it for me...."

10 hours of my precious time wasted today and yesterday, until I can find the method to uninstall the idiotic speed patch of yours I can not play this game as missions are friggin impossibly hard and I keep on instant dieing if I try to level, if I can't play this game then of course, canceling my accounts, and encourage others to do the same, oh yes, and as well you will never seen any business from me or anyone else I know either.
I will  contribute to the already teaming masses of irritated customers.

Anglais @ 11/22/2001 10:49:36 PM (1390):
I was wondering about that.  Twice now I've had my runspeed boosted.  I had just cleared the mission and I was running back to grab the item and I thought things were moving a little more quickly than usual.  I looked at my stats and my runspeed had gone from 200 to 700.  It's a shame it reset when I zoned - it would have been a quick trip back to town.  (I coulda raced a plane...)

They (Funcom) had numerous tester reports of these "new" pathing problems while 13.0 and it's follow-ons were on the Test server.  They pushed the patch(es) out anyway.

Frankly, I've just about given up on doing free "patch beta-testing" (as opposed to the "game beta-testing" we're all doing) for them, since they don't listen to testers.  Even when they suddenly "discover" that the testers weren't lying, and things really are hosed, they still can't seem to fix the problems.

It's one big lose/lose/lose situation anymore.

Okay, this is one of those really really minor bugs that has no gameplay significance but has bugged me forever.  The launcher misspells atrox characters (on the character selector) as "athrox".

I've never seen anyone point this out , but it is really minor, and please fix other problems first .  But, there it is just in case it really was overlooked.

When you get the message "Unable to perform this action" try hitting the escape key a few times, reselect yourself and try it again.  Doesn't work every time but most times and has helped eliminate the need for zoning in and out of missions.

Icaria @ 11/23/2001 1:15:49 AM (The Infamous Holes in the Wall Mission! 1539):
I can't believe I was either so full of turkey or so tired that I once again took the mission at 1304.5, 612.6 in Holes in the Wall.  Do yourself a favor, folks, write that one down and stay away from it for awhile.  As they say up here in Northern Maine, "You just can't get they-ah from he-ah, de-ah!"  The mission is actually in the next area, Stret West Bank.  So you CAN get thay-ah, you just lose the mission when you zone.

Oberan @ 11/23/2001 3:01:25 AM (Bug with Martial Artist Velocity Run buff 1543):
Well i think its called velocity. Basically its a 70 point run buff but it OVERWRITES the adventurer 100 point run buff!!

It costs more ncu, more nano, more requirements and gives less bonus than the adventurer free movement buff yet it overwrites it.

Does that make sense?

Ming @ 11/23/2001 3:04:20 AM (1414):
No. What is actually happening (I think) is the mobs aren't where the client is reporting them. We see them right in front of us, but they aren't actually there. Dimach just does nothing. It goes off, makes the noise, but no "parry" message over the NPC's heads. I HATE this last patch with a passion. It's one of the poorest excuses for a "patch" I've ever seen in any software.  Yep, I'm irate about it alright. 

There are lots of sync issues now, usually in dungeons, that have manifested since the last release. Unfortunately, these look like "needle in the haystack" type code bugs that I doubt will ever be addressed. The best I'm hoping for is that with FC's non-existant QA they'll unbreak these things accidentally.

Brawl often whiffs too, whereas this only happened on actually parries in the past.

Good grief.... While losing gametime due to bugs sucks, you could at least make some effort not to make a complete idiot of yourself. When you chose to convert the database the manner in which you uninstall it was written all over the screen. When you got patched up to 13.0 it AGAIN popped up telling you "if you're not pleased with the way the speed database is working for you, click delete". I didn't check the date of the post but 13.0 is "old" by now so I'm assuming it's dated post that.

Someone buy this man some high ql genious implants.

Mistress @ 11/23/2001 11:54:00 AM (404):
Just to add to this thread in the hopes Funcom will actually read it.

I play a Lev 54 Adventurer and up until patch 13 have never really had any major problems. Therefore I rarely post on these boards. However after watching all the hotfixes roll by over the last week I'm starting to get really frustrated that this hasn't been fixed yet.
As it stands now I can barely scrape by on running missions... earning any cash is a major problem. Even greens can be a close call if they self heal and have a damage shield.
I do my best to avoid missions with NPC mobs... by putting chaos up to 90% on the mission slider as my riders still do very nice damage against monsters and missions are very doable between 50 and 75%. However all I seem to get are missions full of NPC's now... I rarely get monsters anymore 
Doing my best to work around this until they fix it but I'm seriously considering playing my Trader until they do.

Please Funcom fix this bug!! Us adventurers are suffering aswell!!!

Tegan @ 11/23/2001 12:31:56 PM (1464):
Well I agree that they have fixed chain-healing on certain classes of npc's as I have noticed only certain (seems especially adventurer) npc's chain-healing.  In effect it looks like the npc's are continually applying a heal buff to themselves and each other - so not exactly a heal nano but has exactly the same effect.

Regarding the difference in previous chain-healing mobs - certain classes I have seen improved - but other npcs are applying heals or buffs in a manner that has made them ever harder than the previous chain-healing bug (this could be because it's coupled with the lower damage currently being done to npc's... but the combination is brutal).  Previously I have had no problem taking on non-chain healing orange mob's up to 3 with my MA Doc, so I do not believe that this is just an issue of monster difficulty. 

So in answer, previously even with chain-healing orange mob's of 2 - I could eventually kill them - now it is impossible.  I think it is absurd to spend 25 minutes attacking 2 oranges (and continually healing and first-aiding myself the entire time - with a few zones thrown in) and not be able to take even one down past 50% health.  Obviously other players and funcom also felt this was not appropriate as they "fixed" it.  *And this is not the current regeneration bug as I can see them casting on each other as their health increases.

I have played AO faithfully since the beginning (struggling through some pretty horrible gameplay bugs) - but I don't want game crippling bugs to slip through the cracks because they fixed 80% of the chain-healing npc's.  Having at least a 20% (if not statistically more) chance of my 50% mission being un-playable is enough to make me call it quits.

And my Doc kicks my Crat's butt anyday - so I know she's tougher than that...

TA-DA!! they cant use their own heals because of a lack of skill! i blew throu several missions doing that and not a single mob treied to heal himself   hope this helps!

Thug @ 11/23/2001 1:35:49 PM (1254):
chaincasting mobs with infinite nano are BACK, dunno if it had to do with the client patch the other day but i just got out of a mission that took a friend and i over 30 minutes to take down 3 mobs because of insane HP regen and chaincasting the healing spell. 

One mob healed itself 12 times before we put him down, and this was after we killed his two bud's whome he was healing as well. 

it was crazy, i used about 1k in bullets, a TON of first aids, we had to take turns getting them to aggro on us so one could sit down and recharge nano while the other fought.

we could have deleted the mission, but we were both pretty ticked off about the whole thing and so needed to see those three mobs DIE.

Kohistan @ 11/23/2001 1:37:26 PM (NPC's having godlike AC and HP | Ideas and thoughts on the sub. 1580):
Yesterday I was doing a lot of missions with different NPC's in them. 

Im a lvl 53 Fixer wielding a QL 100 mausser, 1400 HP and about 1700 AC.

What I found out was that Human NPC's is different from eachother - Were before patch (13.0) the hardness off them was determined mostly by what Lvl they were. After the patch its more their Proffesion that determines their HP/AC. 

An Ex. on it: I fought a Rookie OT Martial Artist - who was dark orange to me. The NPC hit me for around 60 every few seconds. I hit her with well over 150 every time, with good crits and a good burst and I killed her in about 2-3 mins.
The next room was a bright Yellow OT Enforcer (About 1 level below me) - He hit me for about 40-50 every time, but 50% of my hits were below 60, it took me 5-7 mins with using 2-3 First Aids and 2 bursts to kill him. 
I tested this over and over again - And I found out that allmost every Combat class (Enforcers, Soldiers etc.) would make me do min. dmg at them. Were non combat classes (NT's, Trader, Fixers etc) were easy kills and I critted often against them. 
The conclusion must be that a lot of Fighter class Human NPC's in missions have been given AC stats that are Player a like (Or even higher) ... But the thing is that they have 3-5 times more HP than us. I have nothing against NPC's getting same/higher AC stats as Players - But if U wanna do this, some things needs to be changed. 

1# give NPC's same amount of HP than a player same level.

2# The INSANE HP regeneration rate the NPC's have when A player zones, must be lowered - I know that it should be fair that when Players heal, so should NPC's. But when u enter a gang bang room its not many players that can keep themsellf alive without zoning at least one time. 

Other mission changes:
3# Loot - we need better loot from mobs. When I kill a orange mob, they allways have loot that is way lower than I can use. the sole purpose of doing missions is to get money and loot.

#4 The option to have more RP'ing missions - Some use missions only as a way of getting some quick cash. But there should be missions for those who wanted to do less Hack 'n' Slash and more RP. (I have posted numorous ideas on the boards - but it seems like FC have totally given up on answering any Threads)

#5 Distance slider on the mission booth (And change the reward amount from Distance to a combination of Diff and Distance)'

#6 Get rid of all those Clothes and nanos given as rewards, after Patch 13.0 the Mission camping has been upped 3-4 times (I see people sitting infront of the mission booth a hour at a time). 

............

A couple of other things:

This is no flame or rant. But U guys in the Dev. department needs to start making things that rewards players more. This game gives no rewards for players sitting hour after hour hoping for a good mission, doing uber hard hunting, etc. What would make u very popular and luuuved was if u implemented unique things - one of its kind - We need more things that can help people love this game more and surprise them - So its not the same old borring routines. There is no other pleasure than finding a unique ring/weapon/armor anything... After a fight with a hard mob - 
As the game is atm - its way to predictable - When I solo a dark yellow mob I get no reward for it, I get XP and some money.. And to tell u the truth its dead borring. I want to be surprised by finding a "Home made Mausser" - An unique mausser that has just a bit better stats than an ordinary, same QL. 
The unique items does not need to be high and mighty uber things - (Some uber rare Uniques could be very good) - But for the most of it, just some minor changes (stats and apperance) to a weapon, armor, nano.. u name it. This would add to a more un-predictable game. And would give players more pleasure doing stuff. 


Ok Think I have said enough for now  _ Not that one will ever see an official comment - But others are welcome to add to the ideas.

but it seems like it's back now. i had the same problem tonight. they're chaincasting constantly again and never run out of nano. 

it wasn't like this for a couple weeks, it's just been today. i have to assume something happened to cause the chaincasters to come back again.

gah, mobs already get 3 times the amount of HP we do, why do they need to heal too? just pull them from the database.

or drop their HP, give them FINITE nano, and make the game fair. hehe

Thug @ 11/23/2001 1:45:54 PM (1326):
yes indeed, this is damaged based a lot of time, I use a mausser and suffer minimum damage on a lot of the same mobs you mentioned. my friend uses the vector *Duck evade/energy* has problems on different classes of NPC's then I do. his are much less so though.


and his crit's are insane at his his level. 28 with a ql43 vector, i'm lvl 31 with a ql61 mausser and he's critting for 450 and i'm critting for 250 when fighting muties. when fighting npc's i crit for 150 or less. 

and my burst very often does less damage on the npc's then my regular attack.

either I need a vector or they need to fix this problem real quick

Thug @ 11/23/2001 2:00:02 PM (PVP rules applied to NPC's affects Damage TYPES more than certain classes. 1582):
My Experience.

Projectiles are nerfed against a lot of NPC mobs.

whereas the Vector ND shotgun seems to do just fine against these, one or two other mobs cause problems for the Vectors. 


now pvp rules are set to halve the damage before an AC/evade check. so perhaps both weapons are having their damages halved. as does seem to be the case. 

but then comes the ac and evades check. 

ac cuts it even further. and for my mausser, evades stop the crits from happening.


however mob npc's seem to be having difficulty with their IP's as well because the vector is critting as normal, where my maussers crit's are toast. 

not to mention the fact that the vector is a very heavy damage dealing weapon to begin with. so it becomes even more pronounced with this mob bug. 

I would imagine people with vector's just aren't having it as hard as others with more traditional type weapons. 

So i don't think it really has anything to do with a certain class, but rather weapon types. 

the fact is, everyone is affected, but some less than others, or on different npc's then others. because the npc evades and ac's are all different for each class.

so listing mobs isn't going to do a lot of good, because for you, the mobs i have problems with may not be a problem unless we're both using projectile based weapons. 

The problem is humanoid NPC's across the board.  somehow the NPC database has been linked into the PC database for damage. 
thus causing the problem. 

so when your fighting an NPC humanoid the game actually believes your really fighting another person. and thus the PVP rules come into effect.

Basher Tarr @ 11/23/2001 4:22:11 PM (1414):
I dont know if its the same thing, but i get a similar problem often with burst. I click the burst button, the button greys out, but nothing happens. Testing had led me to think its a server-client out of sync problem. 

Try this, next time you are in a mission and your dimach gets eaten by lag, zone out of the mission (the button úngreys as it always does when you zone) and try dimaching again. If dimach works, its the same bug.

Temporis @ 11/23/2001 6:16:27 PM (The Final Insult 1612):
I am a level 72 NT, I have always played Mage like characters in other games, it fits my 'style' of play.
I have nano armor as high as i can wear, I am Mat crea implanted as high as Treatment will bear, I am max nano/nano pool/max health implanted as high as treatment will bear, I have a decent token bar
I also use Enfraams Major prot, and the 102 humid extractor
When I started AO in juli, the NT was described in the manual as the master of Direct damage, and potentially on of the most powerfull characters at higher levels when played right...

Now back to reality..yesterday I'm doing solo missions, I choose about medium difficulty, which yields me a fair amount of 'grey' missions, with no token as result, but thats not even the MAIN issue here,
when I do finaly get a mission with green mixed with some yellow, I run into mr hardened highwayman... (and lets not even Bring up the Torpedo's)

Now mr highwayman is GREEN to me, yet he hits me HARD, so I root him, draw away, and try to nuke...
- Although I invested in Evade Close combat as much as Ip would allow (dark blue!) Im getting hit hard and critted so much that i cant stand toe to toe for more than 15 sec
- My 1:30 min root, which I can just squize in now, breaks after one or two DD spell hits...it used to only break that easely if the rootee is hit by gunfire (after which i decided 'suck up' the wasted IP and do away with the gun)
- When I do actually survive long enough to do extended damage, my Nano pool runs out before I can get Mr highwayman lower than 1/3 of health left, that thing seems to have over 5000" 

So in short, I can live with melee monsters doing high damage, but I cannot live with 1:30 roots breaking in 6 seconds and my implanted, humidified, and 'tokened' nanopool not being able to put out enough damage to 'empty' his healthpool
I hope all agree with me that repetitive zoning is not a viable mission tactic for doing 50% mission with GREEN mobs....

* So, No solo missions anymore for NT

* Group Hunting you say? Facts : Groups are not overly exited about NT, Why?:

- NT are not the king of damage, the 'artilery'...we should have been, A good weaponwielder with a high QL gun outdamages me easy
- NT used to be good for 'MOB' control..., however, our range has been taken away, and roots just don't do the job anymore (read above)
- Since 13, When the DOC is casting Group heal, I CANT CAST MY SPELLS, add a bit of lag to that, and you get useless fast!!!
- since 13, When I'm Casting my spells, THE DOC CAN'T GROUP HEAL, this gets people killed 

* Well of to PVP then... NOT

- With 50% rule in, my Implanted, humidified, 'tokened' mana pool doesnt last me anymore to kill most non healing chars, lets not even discuss the healers...
So Im now mathematical unable to kill these players, even if they chose not to fight back.
- Roots break easely, try keeping an MA away from you now....
- My range was capped, you can only start casting the root once target is in range, by the time cast is done, your already taking heavy melee damage, 
- and guess what, I have very low Health, I have INT/PSY armor, which cant be buffed, I cant wear tank, IM WEAK...an NT is supposed to be weak..BUT THAT WEAKNESS SHOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR BY THE ABILITY TO KEEP DAMAGE AWAY IF GOOD TACTIC IS USED : GOOD ROOTS, RANGE AND HIGH DAMAGE
This was so in July, and although we were not Uber, our compensations have been taken away one by one...

So...we are now 13.1, and my Class has become totaly unplayable, each patch has made it progresively worse...

If you (FUNCOM) are not going to handle these issues...and I mean ALSO THE PVP ONES, I would very much like to know, I like 'the potential' of this game very much, but most contructive critisism that people on these boards try to put out seems to fall on deafmans ears
I know I'm only one of 35000, but I took my time to provide feedback, I would like to know if these things will be dealth with, or if the intention is there to deal with them
Because frankly, I would like to draw my conclusions either way...

megaram @ 11/23/2001 6:21:07 PM (Zone Deaths and other dying issues 1613):
Just wanted to seeif anyone else has experienced this, or is it a feature of the game. 

While fighting a mob in a mission or near a zone, if I notice that I'm not going to kill it, I head for the zone. This is where the issue relies, there have been a couple of different deaths that have happened to me and this has happened several times for each.

1. I zone and visual display freezes and "changing area" is displayed on the chat window. BUT... you still hear fighting and attacks for several seconds... you hear me die... I complete zoning. I'm ok... 0 HP but ok. I heal up and go back and 1st hit for damage from mob does it's normal damage, but I die. All HP disappear. 

2. I zone and visual display freezes and "changing area" is displayed on the chat window. BUT... you still hear fighting and attacks for several seconds... you hear me die... I complete zoning. I'm a walking zombie, running very slow and stats are reduced. I did die, but did not go to reclaim terminal. Have to /terminate because inventory has gone to reclaim terminal without me. 

3. I zone and visual display freezes and "changing area" is displayed on the chat window. BUT... you still hear fighting and attacks for several seconds... you hear me die... I complete zoning, but not to next zone as expected to reclaim terminal. 
(I can understand if I did die, but the thing is that the fight had gone on for at least 3-5 seconds after zoning)

This is a different one, this has happened to me twice. 

I'm fighting with a team and I get aggro'd, I get my rearend spanked (of course, I'm an NT) but then the mob goes after someone else until we kill it. We celebrate the victory, I sit to heal and guess what... 2 or 3 more hits show up (the team is not being attacked by anything) and I die as I tried to heal.

Anyone else have this happen to them?

::EDIT::

How about when in a mission you get chased out the room and get away, heal up go back and the mob just stands there and you kill it no prob.... BUT the next same mob in that mission you encounter will kill you with 2-3 hits. Your HP just dissapears! (HP goes from 75% to 0% in 0 seconds)

1.

I have recently bought a car, a nice Kodiak Turbo IX 
I have 252 in runspeed and the car should buff 260 
I should have 512 and when i bring up the skill menu is says so
but and player with 280 can easïly out run me.
I also tried racing with a yalm with lesser speed than my car
and it out run me aswell.
there is something wrong the kodiak turbo isnt turbo at all, in fact it doesnt buff my speed at all, please fix this I invested loads of ip and cash just to have this car.

2.

the omni-med suit pants doesnt buff treatment like it should

3. 

Why changing the missions closer and less reward??
I cant see the point one of the fun thing was to travel and see new areas on Rubi-ka 
and the reward you get on missions now is almost an insult ...
how can one person earn money
please please bring back the good old missions.

i have found that since 13.0, whenever my gun is about to run out of ammo (4 - 7 rounds left) it starts rapidly firing those last rounds off untill it says "reloading". only the last shot in the series of shots does damage and i have found that there is no delay between when it says "reloading" and the next shot. this leads me to believe that the gun is doing this while it is reloading. i have seen pretty much everyone with a gun who ive teamed with experience this. not a MAJOR bug but irritating nonetheless.

Icaria @ 11/23/2001 10:47:47 PM (Users said it was "Boring"! 1639):
Funcom has stated they made changes to missions because users complained they were "boring".  As I have suggested before, they could have done away with that complaint by better management of the mission terminals.  Of course, the best possibility would be to get the team mission terminals working.

But let me help Funcom understand the word "boring".

Boring is sitting for too long staring at a screen that says "Changing area - Please wait".

Boring is taking a mission that one use to be able to complete in a half an hour and spending an hour and a half or two hours in completing it.

Boring is having to bail out of a mission almost completed because there is absolutely no way to complete it against two MOBs that should be equal to you but due to the unreal armor you can't possibly win the battle.

Boring is attacking one MOB that you can handle only to have two or three others that you can't handle appear from other rooms.

Boring is being forced to leave a mission in order to heal and then having the mission map reset.

Boring is freezing a MOB in a mission and then being unable to get away from it far enough to heal.

Boring is the inability to safely use concealment as you will pop out of it for no reason and be attacked.

Boring is spending 15 or 20 minutes just to wear down one MOB.

Boring is taking three to four missions in order to get to the next level when it used to be possible to do it in a mission or two.

Boring is having to take three or four missions before you find one that you can complete.

Boring is to have to spend twice as much time trying to heal because there seem to be no level 40 treatment labs or first aid kits.

Boring is having to make sure you have two to three times as many treatment labs in your inventory as before the "improvements".

Boring is having to carry fifty first aid kits into a mission where before you seldom ever needed them.

Boring is having to make sure you have a tousand rounds of ammunition or more in order to even approach a level when you used to be able to do it with 500 rounds or less.

Boring is to have to ignore a plea for help from a new player because one feels so pressured for time.

Boring is being unable to gain levels more quickly so the player can get out and explore the world.

Boring is the inability to use items because one doesn't have the experience points to assign for them, and knowing it will take so very long to gain them.

Boring is trying to find the next Mausser you can mount as you go from store to store and find none in inventory.

Boring is running from store to store and town to town trying to find the right implants and when you do find them you may be levels beyond them.

Boring is wondering if under the way the game is set today if we would have any lever 200 players, ever.

Boring is playing a game that you love but are slowly learning to hate as it's getting to be less and less "fun".

Boring is you reading all this when you ought to be out playing the game!  <chuckle>  Or writing it when you're not sure it's going to have any impact at all.

MrWaddles @ 11/23/2001 10:55:47 PM (Run Speed generally broken 1640):
A LOT of players are reporting "odd" behavior in the game with regard to how run speed is being interpreted.  Just in the last couple of days I've seen the following odd behavior, which seems to support there being some general problems in how the game is currently interpreting the "Run Speed" stat.

My MP normally has a run speed of around 77.  Nothing spectacular, but not hideous for an Atrox.  When I need to get somewhere quickly, until I can spend the IP to use my Kodiak, I usually get a run speed buff from a fixer.

Last night, I got "Hack Grid Vector" from a fixer, which increased my run speed to 267 (as shown on the stats display).  Yet actually running did NOT appear to be substantially faster than I was doing at 77.  I had a fairly long distance run (on roads) to check it out, and while I'd say there was a slight increase, it was barely perceptible.

I made a point of checking right as "Hack Grid Vector" wore off, and despite my run speed stat dropping back to 77, the speed decrease was indeed negligible back to my "normal" run speed rate.  I did try stopping and starting again bost post-buff and post-buff-expiration.  I also tried switching between walk/run mode at both transitions.  None of it appeared to make a difference.

Considering that 267 is nearly 4x the run speed I normally have, I would expect a far more dramatic change (and recall the change being far more dramatic in the past).  As it is, there's little point to even get the buff given how little practical difference it makes.  And yes, friends with Kodiaks are also reporting similar problems with "ground speed" differences not yielding much actual difference.

Travel in the game gets more tedious and time-consuming by the day.  Hidden nerfs/bugs breaking run speed buffs just make the game all that much more tedious.  Onorous Vehicle skill requirements make the use of vehicles, 30000 years in the future, something restricted to an extremely exclusive set of people.

Please fix Run Speed buff problems.  At the least, this would make things no more tedious than "usual", as right now things are a LOT worse.

Long-term, vehicle requirements need reduction.  There is simply nothing to be gained by making ownership far more trivial than ability to use vehicles.  Particularly when so many vehicles yield such "minimal" speed increases.  If folks can BUY the vehicles, aside from perhaps somewhat-more-plausible higher air vehicle skill costs, there should be no reason they cannot USE the vehicles.  The way the game works now is just wholly counter to how vehicles work in the real world.

The whole concept of "most should endure tedious, slow travel" is horrifically counter to "fun" in any practical sense, yet this game is mired in that concept.  

It's awfully hard to believe that 30,000 years in the future, the use of vehicles (including motorized ground vehicles) will have returned to something resembling the very earliest days of "personal automotive transportation" in terms of accessibility and benefits.

Icaria @ 11/23/2001 10:56:43 PM (1612):
I can only agree with your sentiments.  As a Level 31 Fixer I'm running in to the same problems.  But my biggest problem is I have been in the game for maybe four months and in that time I have created / played / deleted quite a few characters as I looked for the better ones.  So far my MA is the only one that seems to be somewhat consistent and then only when teamed with my son, an Agent.  He pulls them out of a crowd when he can and then I spin `em around a bit.  <chuckle>

My Fixer takes maybe three missions before finding one he can survive.  And then it's a question of "Do I really want to?" after the first few grays.  Credits are no problem, experience points are what is needed to level and it's getting to be a real chore to level.

I love the game, and it appears you do too.  I guess the question we both have is just what is the level of our patience.

I'd hate to have to go back to Diablo II.  <ROFL>

fill my favorites folder
customize my key configuration
fix my environment effects
fix my sound settings

everyone i talk to says theirs saves. Well lucky me i have to spend 10 mins every time i relog, crash or log on just to get started playing. This is the 3rd time i have posted about this issue and i think 3 patches later i still have to deal with this.

AND IM REALLY GETTING ANNOYED!!!!!!
 
im out like my grandma in a wet tshirt contest

MuscularBeaver @ 11/24/2001 1:06:49 AM (1639):
Amazing is that you only need 50 first aid kits to complete a mission.  I make sure I have no fewer than 300 before I start.  Maybe you're just not playing an agent. 

Endlessly frustrating is that you spend all your IP in one way, then Funcom changes the balance so that all your IP investment is now wasted.  So you start spending IP another way, then Funcom changes the balance, then all your investment is wasted. So you start spending your IP yet another way, then Funcom...rinse, repeat.

MuscularBeaver @ 11/24/2001 1:14:13 AM (More frustration - rooted on exit 1648):
This one I really hate.  

It's bad enough that the play balance is so unpredictable that the only way to beat some green and yellow (and sometimes even GRAY!!!) MOBs is to fight the MOB near the mission exit so that you can zone out, use a treatment, then zone in and fight some more. 

But what REALLY irks my goat (to coin a new phrase) is when I've got a MOB down to 1/4 health, but I'm nearly dead, so I zone out. 
The MOB casts a root nano on me, and it doesn't take effect until I'm OUT of the mission area.  Then I have to stand there for 1-2 minutes waiting for it to expire.  I can use maybe 3-4 first aid kits in that time, which doesn't heal me to full.  But naturally, when I zone back in, the MOB is back to full health, and I have to start that fight all over again.  And there's always a good chance I'll get stuck in a root when I get the MOB back to 1/4 again anyway. 

If there's a workaround to this, or any way to cancel the root nano, someone please let me know!

Really ? Well, let me tell you something new. A fixer, and in fact most classes, wasn't made for combat. Huh ? No, really. It has something to do with roleplaying. You can't do those missions alone. Get over it and get help (from a soldier or something, a class that *was* made for combat).

... If you want to fight (solo) through the game, why did you choose a fixer and not a soldier ?

manual firearm reload bug: the user cannot manually load ammo.

med-kit bug: the user cannot use a first aid kit or treatment kit and gets no feedback why not.

"take it easy": the user attempts to initiate combat, cannot, and gets the feedback "take it easy".

weapons/items being corrupted (and of course FC will not replace them).

Okay, done.  But the mission doesn't end and I have searched the WHOLE building.  Everyone is dead, and I've got the item and brought it to mission booth(even though mission should end when I look at or pick up the item)

So, the mission doesn't end which means I don't get the cash, or my reward item, or my mission token. It's a total jip.

Then, because this stupid mission is locked, no other missions will start!! I go to the coordinates and noting happens.

Please help, this sucks.

Guess what, 2 consecutive " find and live with" missions don't complete. No money(20,000), no token, what the **** boys. We did this last week.

I dont know if I am angrier at you incompetent babboons for your pathetic game or myself for believing that tomorrow it will work bug free or that the next patch will help. Ha!

Other things that pissed me off.

Lost 15 health for jumping a tree root- is that working as intended?

Died in a mission, while no damage was registered against my char. and I was hitting mob. Now, I won't rant on this because I have learned to bolt the mission whenever something screwy arises, but ****, fix this bug. I fell over dead with 1600 health points remaining. Has anyone complained about this particular little problem before? Huh, maybe everybody. Maybe in the next patch you can ignore this, but implement a new line of flowery panties by Miir, that would be superduper!

The cold reality is that the solo missions are suppose to be done alone, regardless of whatever profession you are.  "Background-wise" the mission terminals are suppose to tailor their selection towards your profession.  

Additionally, giving someone whom who've paid to do a job that is impossible or obscenely difficult with little pay is a sure-fire route to disaster, in terms of your reputation for future missions.  After all, when word spreads around that you give suicide missions to all applicants, who's gonna want your jobs?  

The excuse of "hey, it's roleplaying" would only apply to PvP since you're not being paid, no one is giving you the mission, you CHOOSE to have your ass handed to you as fixer.  Solo mission terminals are suppose to be different.

Indeed, the old "Funcom approved" strategies of missioning such as blitzing should have been allowed to continue.  Fixers and adventurers are ideal at such things.  There is NO LOGIC in making them play it out as a soldier.  There is NO LOGIC in having to kill everything in the dungeon even though the slider is set all the way to GOOD (in BAD yes, but not GOOD).  

The only reason they lost that ability is because some sad sad people saw it and thought fixers were exploiting, while in truth, it wasn't a bug (design or otherwise).  These whiners just want everyone to play it their own way.  These are the people who want the game to just boil down to HP/AC.  I've got more than you... nadda nadda nadda.  No thought, no skill.  Just numbers.  No tactics.  Sad.  Very sad.  Funcom, are you catering to this vocal minority of number crunchers?  

No?  Seems like you are when 

1) You remove all other valid (by your accounts) tactics and force everyone to do it one way, regardless of their profession.

2) You continuously bump up the MOB HP/ACs because of the overequippers (same vocal number-crunching group).


What a solution to this whole mess?  Simple one.  Drop the true exploiters.  Yup, make MOB HP/ACs equivalent to players, drop implants/weapons/armor of those currently over-equipped (if they can't put it back on, they don't deserve it).  That solves almost everything.  The only thing left is to tie the mission objective more closely with the text.  If our only viable way to finish a mission is to KILL everything, then say so in the briefing.  

I'll be honest with you.  If you do this, you'll lose some of the whiners.  They'll leave.  I won't kid you on that.  But if you wish to stay in business for the four years of this story, you need to get rid of them because the way that this game is going, it's catering to them only.  Newbies will play, notice the difficulty, and leave.  The whiners will leave too, slowly, but leave nonetheless, when their limited attention capabilities get diverted to other online games come out.  When you aren't able to do their request #394893.  They'll go "this suxxors, let's bail" and will leave one way or another.  Think carefully about what you want as a business.

And yes, this is a rant.  I'm sorry for that, but sadly, it appears that those are the only opinions you have listened to in the past.

I think the problem with runspeed is in the formula they use for how runspeed actually affects real speed.

I have a su****ion that it's logrithmic.

I have ~100 runspeed, and my Kodiak adds around 200, making my inside vehicle speeds near 300.  It doesn't noticably increase my speed.  On long distance runs, I can barely tell the difference (From the OT outpost past Harry's to the SW mines - barely tell the difference).  I think I am around half again as fast with the car on.

One time, I made the trip in alot less time.  Confused, I checked my NCU, and a fixer had put a +~250 runspeed buff on me without me realizing it.  So from my 120 runspeed, with the car and the buff, my runspeed was ~550.  I'm pretty sure I made it in half the time I normally do.

What I wanna know is why I can almost run as fast as someone with my meager runspeed using a car?  Just doesn't make sense.

nikh @ 11/24/2001 12:41:19 PM (1244):
BUMP! another quite true issue. The MA weapons are ok - not that great but a fair alternative the the MA special attacks that you cannot use while wielding the weapon.

But these bugs make them quite a pain to use. Basically, you can anly use them in missions - because its "easy" to zone in and out to correct the bug. But if you're hunting outside, forget them altogether, otherwise, you can have real big problems.

...................................

Im prolly one of the most uber equipped Fixers at my lvl (56) - I can in 90% of the time solo a diff 65% mission - Not allways shooting everything. But just enough to find the item..
And u know what? - I would give all that crap up for missions with implemented RP'ing - Regardless if u are in a team, missioning - Its STILL only Hack 'n' slash. The only way a fixer can make real money is to do missions, we have no specials to sell.

What would be the ultimate move from Funcom would be to make missions that actually didnt involve massmurder all the time. Im getting sick and tired of missions only has one goal - and that is to kill kill kill..
Often I just sit in Tir chatting with people - because missions is making me sick and money is needed if U want to level - Equipment, weapons, nanos and implants needs upgrading all the time.

Why dont they make missions that is relative to u'r profession - Soldiers should have Kill-missions all the time. But as Fixer I want to option to have mission were I actually feel like a Fixer.

Its like a 6 month long Quake game - At my level I have prolly slaughtered enough people to get 20 years in the electrical Chair... PLZ consider to change missions for non-combat proffesions (I will not gie any surggestions - I have written so many and It looks like FC dosnt give a f**k anyways)

WGMelchior @ 11/24/2001 6:23:44 PM (1639):
Individual missions means that the taker can do them themselves. Am I correct in assuming this?

Why should some people have a harder time doing them then? Until they fix tradeskills, and make it so that all classes have equal opportunities, that RP stuff isn't worth much.

Limiting someones RP just because they chose a profession isn't what RP is about. If I want to RP a weak Fixer, I chose to do that myself.

WGMelchior @ 11/24/2001 6:25:55 PM (1680):
You people are acting like that have a set number of people, and that they need to stick with those for all eternity.

It seems like the web designers are doing their job. Great, they don't have to hire more of them!

It seems like the dev have a hard time doing their job. Shucks, they need to hire more of them.

See the point? If the webbers are doing good, doesn't that enables them to hire more dev people?

Archu @ 11/24/2001 6:33:28 PM (Retrieval missions bugged? 1709):
I got the item and exited the dungeon. How do I insert the item in to the booth so I can get my reward?

I tried to click on the item so it gets attached to my cursor and then right clicking on the booth. It only causes an orange time bar to appear in the upper left corner of my screen to appear. When the bar ends the item returns to my inventory.

Replacing the right click with a normal double clcik did not help either.

Either this is a very nasty bug (The reward is a gun wich is multiple times better than my current one) or then the game manual is way too thin.

Icaria @ 11/24/2001 6:52:08 PM (1639):
Boy, I don't know if the folks at Funcom are reading this or if they are making tweaks on their own but my son and I got one great shock last night.  Haven't had time to fully test yet but my son (level 43 Agent) and I (character was a level 43 MA) set up for missions as we usually do.  Center the main slider over the first "i" in "mission" set the good/bad to full bad and the cash/exp to full cash.  We surf together and each get one in the same area to cut the travel time.

This usually results in everything from green through light orange and we can usually fight our way through watching each others backs and working to avoid agro situations.

Well, the first one we hit last night resulted in "What the F***?", but in a nice way.  The first room had the usual three MOBs and we have no clue what was in any of the other rooms!  The first three were some kind of red and hammered us so badly we almost didn't make it out.  So we went on to the second mission not to far away and guess what?  Badly hammered again!

Gave up both missions gladly and we went on to one of our favorite hunting areas nearby.

This is NOT a complaint if they are tweaking the mission system to allow us to have better control over what we get.  I'll try others today in hopes the good/bad slider is controlling the level of the MOBs and the main slider is controlling the distance to the missions.  In fact . . .  

    THIS WILL BE GREAT!

Icaria @ 11/24/2001 7:36:43 PM (1639):
Boring is having to sit and again move everything in your backpacks and inventory because they all were scrambled.  While Funcom fixed most, it still happens.  So we enter a mission and start moving the ammo to the top, the med kits to the top, the lock pick to the top . . . . and let's not forget the bomb tool.

DarkOmen @ 11/24/2001 7:46:22 PM (Any ETA on when med suit pants are going to be fixed 1712):
This bug doesnt happen to everybody but it happens to alot of people. The pants and skirt do not register and give you the treatment that it has stated. Some people in my guild say they work for them but most say the pants and skirt are bugged--could it be a race or class issue? i an a nano nt  and they dont work for me but i have never done a poll in guild chat to find out what classes and races they worked for or did not work for.
Now i understand that this is probably low on your list of things to fix but with the capping of the treatments at 100 those extra few points in skill at higher levels add up to many thousands of ip's and i do hate wasting ip

Borox @ 11/24/2001 7:59:49 PM (1697):
When I'm in my yalmaha I try to stop and unequip it before I zone.
It isn't always possible to see the zone line because of the speed I'm going, so If I zone in my plane I stay where I am (make sure you're close to ground) and get out of the plane and get right back into it. If you don't do that you can't control it correctly, and I
don't hink you travel as fast and more more easily attacked. Another thing I do is hit the tab key to make sure nothing nasty is around to kill me while I'm waiting for the plane to equip.

Borox @ 11/24/2001 8:13:47 PM (1638):

NanoFixer @ 11/24/2001 8:27:28 PM (735):
Somewhat related.

I have noticed that the bullets, first aid, treatment and other stackable items have a problem stacking.  And it appears that the problem is the items found in missions will not stack with vendor/store bought items.  Mission items will stack with mission items.  Vendor items will stack with vendor items.  But vendor items and items found in missions are unable to stack together.  Is there some type of tag on these items that identifies them as different types?  Maybe this is causing the stacking problem I am having.  Fixing this might fix the weapon reloading problem as well.

Cordially,
NanoFixer

Kohistan is right about the missions - I usually don't even read the description or the target. I'll find that out when I meet him/it.

Icaria : Funcom will be able to help you out if you tell them where it happens, you shouldn't let them guess or they'll not find it =)

I've not encountered this bug myself, the only time I have to rearrange my inventory is when I die and have to get everything out of the reclaim terminal again.

cold @ 11/24/2001 9:56:13 PM (1680):
And here's another amusing person 

WGMelchior, you are probably no programmer so let me explain -
the codebase for a game like this is HUGE. It would take months, at the very least (ok weeks maybe if you happen to find a genius), for a new programmer to get to know how things work and be productive. Months, not hours. Plus, they'll need guidance from the existing team, and development willl slow for some time.

You can't just hire new developers and be productive the next day.

I have only started experiencing this bug after the 13.0 patch.

I'm a crat.  When I attack a mob, I use my pet and DD nanos, no weapons.  I'm in a mission (I haven't hunted since so this is the only place I know for sure that it happens) and there's a mob I want to attack.  I send in my pet, who starts attacking the mob, and I use my DD nanos.  While I'm attacking the mob, all of the sudden, it automatically turns on my combat.  I have no weapons on, so it's making me hit the mob with my fists which does about 2 damage.  This wouldn't be that big of a problem except for the fact that it somehow interferes with my nano casting.  Other than that it's a really big annoiance and has never happened before.

Bjond @ 11/25/2001 3:40:08 AM (IP lost/unusable -- show stopper bug 1741):
Currently, I have a character that has lots of spare IP, but none of it can be used.  Raising a skill works normally, except after clicking accept, the skill is unchanged and the IP hasn't been spent.  Doesn't matter if I rezone, save the char, get more xp and try again, relog, etc. etc..  Basically, the character has been IP-blocked and can't raise skills anymore.

Also, my petitions have been ignored on this and I'm not the only one with IP allocation problems.  One friend lost 40K IP.  He went to try and use some of his spare IP and voila, it's all gone.  Another lost 12K IP.  GMs did respond to these and I witnessed one response, which was basically, "sorry, nothing I can do, live with it".  Frankly, I don't even know why Funcom has GMs.  I've had maybe 3 or 4 responses out of countless petitions and the only thing the GM ever does when one does show up is say, "I'm sorry, I can't help you". 

This IP bug ammounts to character destruction and really needs to be addressed absolutely immediately.  We need to hear a response in this thread stating a date for resolution and we need to have the resolution in game.

Bjond @ 11/25/2001 3:49:26 AM (1415):
I think it's due to NPC armor-buffs being stacked.  If there are adventurer or engineer NPCs in the mission, all the NPCs around them (and those NPCs, too) will have very high AC and take minimum damage.  If you kill them off and then come back after a while, the AC buffs will have faded and you'll hit the MOBs normally again.

I noticed this when I killed an adv then died to a tripple set of orange enforcers in the next room (min. damage to all of them).   But, when I returned to the mission, the enforcers were taking regular damage again.  If you notice some human MOBs taking low damage, look about and I bet you'll find an adventurer MOB nearby.

There are lots of bugs with MOB NFs -- the most obvious one is the quadruple damage shield, where you run into a MOB with Adv, Enf, Soldier, and Eng damage shields all stacked up on the same MOB (this shouldn't be possible).  I think the high AC bug is another case like this, but with the AC buffs.

Gimme a break -- they don't need *more* programmers, they need *skilled* programmers.

There would be no memory problems.  The game would run fine on both recommended and optimum hardware as opposed to barely running at all on the optimum (you have to far exceed the optimum recommendations to enjoy playing AO).

You can tell the devs are green when the artwork team finishes first.  You can tell the devs are inept and should be fired when they fail to learn from past mistakes and continue to add new major bugs each patch.  This dev team is killing AO with bugs.

Coldstrike @ 11/25/2001 4:41:27 AM (1640):
I'm pretty sure it makes a difference. Today I did a little test. I have 190 run speed myself, and someone in my team had close to 240. That person would have to stop and wait for me all the time, indicating that he was running faster than me.

Bjond @ 11/25/2001 5:51:39 AM (1640):
The client display is also tied closely to runspeed.  For instance, if you close your window, your character will run so fast he'll almost teleport (until you open it again -- kinda hard to stear with the window closed ).  If you turn off "bobbing", you will run faster, etc. etc..

The same goes for fighting.  The client controls much of the timing and your graphics frame rate controls much of the timing of the client (poor client design showing through there).  This is why Yalmahas are so amazingly fast.  They add less raw speed than a low level fixer runbuff (about +200), but they cut travel time to a tenth of even the best runbuff speed.  When you're in the air, you don't bounce and the only thing the client needs to draw is the sky.

Bjond @ 11/25/2001 5:57:45 AM (1639):
If you have no-drop items in your main inventory, it will eventually scramble up each zone.  You'll need to die or terminate to fix it.  Packs are always scambled and don't ever trade directly out of a pack -- that can result in the item being lost or other equiped items vanishing off your character.

The take it easy bug does seem to actually be fixed.  That other bug that says you have to wait till the previous battle is complete, even though the battle is complete and you don't get to hit back at all even when hit has not recurred for me, so I don't think it is a serious bug.  I was not lagging when that bug happened.

I used to be able to create take it easy at will by switching targets just as something died and I no longer can.  I think this one is finally gone and I'm thankful.  If it isn't gone the frequency has been greatly reduced.  I used to get take it easy several times a day and I no longer do.

One time I did think I had a Take it easy bug but it turned out I was in a lag burst for about 10 secs.

Nano clusters of Sprinting (or Run Speed) do not exist in game.  I petitioned pointing this out, and a GM answered me that they (clusters of sprinting) were indeed in the game.  I have continued to search over the last 5 weeks and have never seen any clusters of any QL.  I have seen many times, implants in the shops with this quality (Run Speed).

In searching the forums, I have seen other posts about this same exact topic with people saying that they do not exist.

Since you guys have covered most of the big bugs, I only really have a couple of MA bugs to tack on:

-MA Weapons break if you:

-Zone
-Buff
-Debuff
-Increase skills associated with attacking using IP and then hit 'Accept'

On top of that, MA's can punch with sledgehammers and katanas (not MA weapons, as they have no MA skill requirement and MA has no bearing on their accuracy)... Alot of players would like to know if this is a VALID tactic or not, ie will FunCom nerf this? Increasing numbers of MAs are using hammers...

MrWaddles @ 11/25/2001 10:04:34 AM (1750):
You know, the saddest part is that their boilerplate "We can't tell if you are telling the truth" is a lie.

They have the save states for characters, and they have historical copies of them as well (used for rollbacks, among other things).  They undoubtedly have the tools to examine the inventories of those save-state characters as well (they have demonstrated this in removing items from the game).  That combination of information is ALL THEY NEED to confirm you are telling the truth.

Funcom really needs to stop lying to it's customers in cases like this, and instead give the truthful answer:  "We're too lazy to bother checking and fixing these situations."  It's not pleasant response, but neither is their lying and saying they cannot check things they clearly CAN and HAVE checked and used in the past.

For a multi-million-credit game item like a Yalm, in the face of known bug situations explicitly causing the item loss, Funcom further being dishonest to the customers affected is just shoddy and unethical.

It's worth noting that the other companies when faced with specific highly-exclusive items being lost due to a specific, known and customer-unavoidable system bug usually DO return the item, even though their policies don't mandate it.  In many other situations and with lesser bugs causing item losses they won't, but on the big high-effort items they will do so.

Funcom clearly would much rather worry about exploiters than worry about their paying customers' enjoyment.  So far that set of priorities hasn't done very well for them, yet they continue chipping away at what little fun remains in the game in the name of "avoiding exploits".  Maybe they'll figure out what's wrong with their priorities before they go under.  Probably not, though.

when you get hit and your def/agg bar is above half  you autoattack.

Salazar @ 11/25/2001 1:09:29 PM (1737):
I really really hate this. Being an NT the last thing I want to do is fight with my fists. I stopped using weapons over 30 levels ago.
I would like to see a switch so that auto attack can be disabled. I know I can achieve the same results by moving my def/agg bar back to halfway but this seriously increases my cast time for nanos and that is not good.
Auto attack has got me killed on more than one occasion. I have rooted or calmed a nasty mob that has attacked me and try to escape only to find that after casting the nano auto attack kicks in and it breaks root and attacks again. Usually if I am lucky I have enough health to attempt this 3 times, then I die.
For all of us that dont use weapons or melee we should be able to disable auto attack and still get the advantages of having the def/agg bar on full agg.

inanout @ 11/25/2001 1:16:02 PM (GOt no mission anything! 1765):
I have gotten 2 missions in tha psat several days that when I KIlled the Main Mob, I got no mission reward! No Loot, No EXP, No Item, Nothing!

Did a team mission last night.. No Item!  We could not find the item... 4 of u searhed and searched but found nothing.  These missions were in Vermint woods.  

Maybe this can be looked into?

Actually have a chat to her...she has to be one of the coolest NPC's after harry to chat with out on the planet.

She not only comes on to you (very very cool), guess as shes stuck on her own, but also spills the beans on why she is there. Basically to spy on Galway incase he breaks the Pact or whatever it is he has with OT.

Anyhow, totally agree with you. Chars like this, and the way other Clan morons kill our NPC's in our towns and the guards sit around like lemons is a joke. She needs protection, as do the NPC's and the Guards themselves who are all prayed on by opertunistic *&£$ers. We can't even heal them and provide support for them

Nyadach @ 11/25/2001 1:26:19 PM (823):
And the map for Galway county...what gives? that needs 600 mapnav and is a low lvl area for teaming and the like...and missions.

I was walking through the junkyard east of Athen yesterday near the north edge of the map, when I experienced a strange phenomenon. Every few seconds, my character would suddenly be moved back to where it was  a couple of seconds ago. It took me ages to walk through a small group of ruined buildings before I could zone to black mountain and then back, which seemed to fix the bug.

WGMelchior @ 11/25/2001 1:35:06 PM (1680):
Yes, they need to hire more programmers, and teach them how the engine works. That is how you get more people. They need it. Too bad tutoring is broken. 

The only difference between console games and PC games is the hardware. In no way will skill balancing and non-technical bugs be different. If they would have released AO for PS2, all the bugs would still be there. And I'll be damned if they wouldn't manage to get a memory leak there too.

And we don't want to hear about UO or EQ. This is Anarchy Online. No more, no less. You seem like you want the game to be as bad as possible.

Lots of games has their own engine. It can't be *that* hard, if they can manage it?

Even though the post isn't directed at me, I'll say this anyway: Every played Outcast?


Sorry for the rather harsh tone there.

Nyadach @ 11/25/2001 1:43:33 PM (487):
Is it really that hard to give a 2nd nano bar for a spell applied to u from someone else instead of it stoping your spell, then running the docs spell, then restarting yourspell...do we see the gun weilders stop firing when a doc castes on them? NO! do we see melee chars stop hitting when a doc castes? NO! so why do the casters get nerfed yet again!

Nyadach @ 11/25/2001 1:52:41 PM (318):
Yeah, been happening since 13.0 this one 
Found the Esc-F1 works a lot of the time, but some times I have to get up and walk a few steps before sitting and using again.
Damned annoying this when your in a team and need to charge to help out the doc whos getting his ass handed back to him and you cant get the mob off him as your nano less grrr.
FC any chance of a fix?

Nyadach @ 11/25/2001 2:02:18 PM (515):
Ok speaking as someone who hates PvP this might not effect me directly, but I do fully agree.

Do NT's have the same hp as the gun nuts at the same lvl? NO!

Do NT's get immediate special hits in PvP? NO!

Do NT's get a next to limitless number of hits due to carry an almost endless supply of ammo? NO!

So why the hell are the NT's (a combat class according to the description) now have the same range as those who do have these things? Surely FC can't think that all NT's are wondering around now in battle suits and have a few thousand hp :P

Nanogater @ 11/25/2001 2:48:24 PM (Same nick ? 1771):
Is it possible to have two char's with the same nick ?

I got a char on Rubi-Ka 1, but when I searched on his name on AO-web site a second char with the same nick showed up on Rubi-Ka 2... 

If this is not a bug then the idea of being able to switch between dimension 1 and 2 with same char sometime in the future is no longer on the agenda?

Hossley @ 11/25/2001 3:45:58 PM (1217):
Nyadach,

Yeah, I've always fancied talking to her to find out what she's doing, but these days she's camped solid and barely lasts a minute. You always have one full team of clanners there, if not two. She doesn't stand a chance... There must be a lot of NPCs like this who are getting done stupid for low risk exp, it's crazy.

I don't know whether you were around when the 'sploiters were using reflect shields to take down any Juggs and Slayers near reclaim/healing terminal combos, but it's just plain pointless  Too much twitch mentality... Rubi-ka shouldn't be simply a race to 200. 

Maybe we should push for special experience terminals that people can click once a minute to give them some free exp, it'd save them the bother of ever leaving the cities.

Cheers,

Hoss.

When I look up "Frenetic" on the search people option, I get two -- me, RK1 opifex female MA and another, a level 3 atrox enforcer on RK2. This has me worried because if and when they do combine the servers, I doubt they'll allow two people to have the same handles -- probably wouldn't work. So will one of us be forced into a Frenetic2? It would kind of suck if the other Frenetic doesn't even play and I get stuck with the second-hand name.   

I think it's kind of odd that you can name people the same thing over the two servers, though. Is this new?

i totally agree. i wish FC would do something about the team heal interference. i'm also in complete agreement with Otter. it seems that out of every 7 spells i cast 4 or 5 are either fumbled or resisted since the 13.0 patch. what gives? i would also think that some sort of reimbursement to NTs is in order, seeing that we spent a load of time and money to get the range increasing nanos and computer deck items only to have them become useless. i loved my NT, was my favorite class in the game, but i have pretty much ignored her over the last week to play an Enf and an Agent since NT's have been messed with. such a shame too, according to the /played feature, i've dumped 13 days of my life down the drain playing my NT. :\

speardancer2 @ 11/25/2001 6:14:53 PM (1737):
I would definetely like to see a checkbox to turn this feature on and off.. sometimes, in missions, it's a benifit.  Other times, like when you're running for your life, it's a real bother to get hit, and all of a sudden spin around (usualy the  opposite of the direction you were running) and attack.  And you don't always have the luxury of the time to adjust your slider to def to keep this from happening...

speardancer2 @ 11/25/2001 6:25:52 PM (1326):
I've also seen this same effect, most commonly with Advent based mobs.  I wish my adventurer had the sort of Uber defenses and weapons that these NPC's do.

But I've had the low green o----|-----  mobs, where I could only hit them for minimum damage.   This is rediculous!!!!!

My personal guess is that there is a bug allowing these mobs to either stack buffs that shouldn't be stacked, or using Nano's many times higher than the level they should.

Second  guess is that they are simply being generated with equipment too high for their level.

Either way, and whatever the true problem is, this needs to be fixed.

Borox @ 11/25/2001 6:34:13 PM (735):
Here is a little trick i learned recently to stack ammo. It won't work with ammo found in missions, but so far has worked with all ammo i have purchased from vendors. Open a backpack, pick one stack of ammo up and put in backpack, pick it back up, and left click it on the other stack of ammo in your  inventory. you will pick up both stacks, and get a message that both items must reside in the same inventory, put stack of ammo back in inventory and it is stacked. works everytime for bullets and energy weapon ammo

speardancer2 @ 11/25/2001 6:43:46 PM (1771):
RK2 was created to aleviate the overcrowding on RK1, so I don't think anyone needs to fear a "server merge".... if anything, one might expect to see a RK3 sometime in the future....

But as of now, the 2 servers are seperate, and there's no way to move chars between the 2 Rubi-Ka's, so there should be no need to worry about someone on the other server using the same name as you.

Notomni @ 11/25/2001 7:01:49 PM (6 Slot Belts, 64 NCU's. 1784):
Since one of the more recent patches I (and fellow guildmates) have yet to see a 6 slot belt or 64 NCU's in any mission rewards. We had determined the quality level when you can roll these items, yet they could not be rolled...and believe me, we tried. 

6 Slot belts are a necessity for the higher lvl's like myself and guildmates, I have been searching and see none. I'm on RK2 which may change things because I hear alot of 6 slot's are floating around RK1, this is not the case for RK2. I'd just like to know whats up, and whether that is high on the priority list, it is for me atleast.  Thanks.

I know this isn't directly on topic... but has anyone else been seeing less useless pills and crap as mission rewards?

Icaria @ 11/25/2001 7:49:34 PM (943):
OK, I have to admit I'm totally lost.  There is no doubt that Funcom is tweaking the missions in an attempt to undo what thay have done.  I only ask they tell us when they are doing so.  Usually my son and I (Level 43 MA and Agent) set the individual mission sliders with the Easy / Difficult main slider centered over the first "i" in "Mission", then we went full bad with the good/bad slider and then full credits.

Night before last we saw our first mission that looked all red, and very briefly.  <chuckle>  "I don't think so!" was one of the nicer things said.

So we left the sliders alone with the exception of the good / bad and we tried also centering IT under the "i" in "Mission" last night.  We got to the mission and were greeted by three green MOBs and thought we had found the "touch".  Next one was slightly oriange but not any real problem.  Next one was a green.  Next was a darker orange that we almost couldn't deal with but by healing each other while giving our all we managed to take it down.  Then another darker really light green.  Then came the end!

A VERY DARK ORANGE that hit wayyyy harder than we could, with a damage shield like no other and the capability to buff heal like I can't remember seeing.  At least I have yet to see a health buff that will do 20% healing at that level.  And, of course, our hit points dropped by maybe 60% to 70% and were not even close to effective.  We both healed each other until we could no longer and then ran for the door.  Healed and returned to find that SOB, errrr, hate this keyboard . . . MOB had healed to 100%.  So we tried again and THIS time he was suddenly joined by another DARK ORANGE from another room and before long my son and I were staring at each other at the reclaim terminal! 

Come on, Funcom.  Please use your Funk & Wagnalis and look up the word "challange".  You will not find the word "impossible" there anywhere, I looked!

Yesterday my Fixer, Icaria, took three missions and completed zero.  Last night my Martial Artist, Attaboy, took two missions teaming with an Agent and completed zero.

Putting a carrot at the end of a stick to lead a mule is OK, but you need to watch the length of the stick or the mule looses interest.

Icaria @ 11/25/2001 8:04:14 PM (1326):
Went in to a mission with my Level 31 Fixer and tried to pull one of the three MOBs into the entrance.  Of course, I failed and got all three.  But they were only green OT exterminators.  Yeah, sure, that's all they were.  And they were ALL multicasting:

Fire Snake
Hot Foot
Windblade
Molecular Lance
Dual Energized Beam
Smiting Missle

I watched my stats drop like someone had pulled a cork out of the bottle and barely got out of there.  But now I knew what I was up against so I healed, waited, went back in and there was only one.  Took him down fairly well, healed and went to draw again.  This time I got FOUR!  Yeah, right, this is certainly a lot of fun!  <NOT!>

Please, Funcom, turn the agro capabilities down a bit so we don;t have MOBs from adjoining rooms joining in the fray.

That may well be, my point being it ought not to be.  Playing my MA will be difficult without nodrop items.  <chuckle>

Gee, I wonder if we could talk them in to giving us a way to identify packs with letters or numbers?  <grin>  As I usually carry four and one is almost all meds and needed kits it would help.

And here's another amusing person  

WGMelchior, you are probably no programmer so let me explain - 
the codebase for a game like this is HUGE. It would take months, at the very least (ok weeks maybe if you happen to find a genius), for a new programmer to get to know how things work and be productive. Months, not hours. Plus, they'll need guidance from the existing team, and development willl slow for some time. 

You can't just hire new developers and be productive the next day.
			
		
	
Seems to me you arent a programmer either, or at least arent much of one.  My guess is if you do work with any sort of code you are either a college student or hobbyist.

I get handed millions of lines of code for existing programs all the time and am told to fix it.  I dont have months to learn it, or a team to show me how it works, I have to read the code, run the program to duplicate the bugs, and find the error and fix it.  If you think that someone who works with code day in and day out needs months to learn a program you obviously dont work with code much.  Thats a luxory we dont get.

newshadow @ 11/25/2001 8:29:22 PM (60% Plus producing grays 1795):
I wouldn't mind a mission with some grays, it would make for some easy kills. However, when I get over half my mission populated with grays it gets more than a little annoying. I went through over ten missions with no tokens. I killed everything in the mission, all missions were set at 50% or above. But I didn't get a token because there were too many grays and not enough xp was awarded. This needs to be addressed and soon. I want my tokens and xp. Thank you.

I know. and it's ALREADY more. But I was referring to when he said that the game is doomed. But, looking at history, it isn't. Games have been worse off, and still managed to iron themselves out. AO is definitely on a better track than those were, so there's no logical reason to just give up on it.

Taebo @ 11/25/2001 10:12:02 PM (Mission cave and night vision bugs... 1801):
No flames here... 

On the cave type of missions, in some rooms there is water. The water is deep enough that you have to swim. Sometimes there is a bridge crossing the watery section, sometimes not.

The water leads right up to the door, where there is a small ledge of ground, then the door. Once out of the water, literally inches from the door, I could not move in any direction. I had to jump repeatedly to get unstuck to get through the door. This happens almost every time.

Also, sometimes when I turn off my night vision goggles, it stays  'lit green', like they are still on. If I do it again (thinking it didn't take the command), the screen goes into SUPER NIGHT VISION, a blurry bright green over saturated version of night vision. Clicking the goggles again, only turns it back to the normal night vision. The only fix is to zone.

I have Windows XP, a Geforce 3, and Detonator 22.xx drivers. Fog is set to Autodetect, but it did it on "off" as well.

Obit @ 11/25/2001 10:26:32 PM (1640):
Bjond, I'm pretty sure that runspeed is handled on the server side. This is why you sometimes "rubberband", because the server cannot keep up with where you're going, so it sends you back where it last kept track of you.
It wasn't always server-side though. It used to be you could use a program called Gear that you could set so you ran across zones in less then a second. They fixed this a couple of months ago.

edit: a small typo

Icaria @ 11/25/2001 11:51:25 PM (1639):
I'm really getting to a point where I no longer know what to do.  I took another mission today, just kicked the main slider up one click and the good/bad to bad one click.  In the mission I encountered several grays (a total waste of time as there are no experience points), maybe three greens, a yellow and FOUR that were orange.  Why in the WORLD would Funcom give us such a spread when the grays eat time for nothing and the oranges now take three or four times longer to kill than they used to?

Well, I got through it and should have been happy when I found a Kodaik in a chest (that's a car, not a camera!) and a fair pair of armored pants as a reward.  But as I was in this mission for almost an hour and a half I was a lot more tired than I was happy.

Has a cup of coffee and decided that as long as I was in Holes in the Wall anyway I'd head east of the Bronto Burger stand to one of my favorite hunting grounds.

Well I was just as impressed as I could be when I targeted a green Torpedo and found myself agroed by two grays that started hammering on me.  I was taking more hit points from the greens shield than I was delivering at times and one of the grays was hitting for chemicl damage while the other hit for energy damage.  So I headed west real quick and zoned.

Came back, worked my way around, took another shot at a green and wound up with two greens and two grays.  Screw that!

So my question is, what do I do now to level?  I used to level at least once a night and haven't been able to level either my stand-alone fixer nor my teamed MA in two nights, or is it three?

I'm not a "kid", and I can't spend 24 hours a day in the game.  As the only upward path is via leveling I'm concerned that I can no longer level fairly quickly.

If we can't level somewhat quickly what other path do we have to grow and prosper?

This just gets more and more frustrating and I found today that because I decided to help by signing on for six months I'm stuck with paying even if I bail.  It's getting less and less "fun" and I see little telling me it will get better.

Strange, just typing this gives me a "wasting your time" feeling.

And I used to love this game so much.  Maybe it's time for therapy!

Constans @ 11/25/2001 11:54:16 PM (1326):
I hope it really is fixed.

My main struggle with the Uber NPCs is when they either attack faster than you, do more damage than you per hit, or cast healing Nanos on themselves. 

I run into pretty much the same NPCs and it is a nightmare, especially when three are in the first room. It can be almost instant death. 

And to comment on the original post in the thread, Fixers suffer from this as much as Engineers, we aren't an Uber Class. (Although I am not going to have a whinge about Fixers like a lot of Fixers seem to do.)

Misophist @ 11/26/2001 12:07:48 AM (1326):

I know an engy who is doing just fine after this min. damage fiasco. His gun is useless now, but his bot, some sort of q90ish guardbot, has so many hitpoints and hits so hard anyway that minimum damage doesn't really affect it. With the right trimmers, this particular engineer never has to worry much about a mob going aggro on him instead of the bot. Hell, as I watched this engineer play on my computer and show me how easy missions were for him, I kind of wished I had rolled an engineer instead of MA, NT, Trader, Soldier, etc., etc.

Misophist @ 11/26/2001 12:15:57 AM (1771):
Yes, RK2 was created to fix the overcrowding on the first server. But I doubt they'll need a RK3 considering how many people are actually on RK2. 

That said, do you not recall the talk about making it possible for characters to cross over from RK2 to RK1 and vice versa? It would apparenly cost the character something, and be a little complicated, but there hasn't been much discussion on it for a while.

So what I and the original poster are worried about is this -- if the other person who shares our nick happens to cross over to our particular server, will there be two people with the same name wandering around in the same server? Or will one of us be given a secondary title to differentiate? That'd be crappy.

MuscularBeaver @ 11/26/2001 1:30:17 AM (1639):
I haven't leveled once per night in ages.  My agent is now level 69, and I expect it to take a total of about 6-8 nights of play to get to level 70.  I've already played her for 3 or 4 nights and I'm just above  the mid-way point in XP.  

Missions are MUCH harder now, and that's all I do, so I don't expect to level very often.  

In fact, I don't even finish many of the missions very often anymore.  Every once in a while I get a really good one, but many of them are either too boring or too hard.  

If the MOBs are mostly gray, then it's just a waste of time.  

If the MOBs are mostly green, then sometimes it's worth finishing the mission.  But sometimes (depending on the type of MOBs) greens and yellows are so difficult to beat that it simply takes so long to get through the mission that it's not worth the effort.  The worst missions of all are the ones filled with rooms that have 2 or more MOBs. It's tedious work having to split them up by zoning at just the right time, so you can fight one at a time.  After spending an hour or two on 3-6 MOBs in a mission like this, I just give up and go to sleep.  

The worst is when the MOBs near the door are simply impossible to kill.  It doesn't even matter if I zone out a gazillion times - they heal faster than I can hurt them.  Those missions I delete quickly.

Nikki. @ 11/26/2001 1:33:09 AM (1753):
I have never seen a cluster of sprinting. You can however find the implants as mission rewards especially the leg one. You can also find them on Mobs Especially on Borgs. They are in game and confirmed just not buyable :O(  Too bad because they arent always empty for the other slots which is bad :O(.

Hossley @ 11/26/2001 1:49:17 AM (1464):
Ya,

In my experience it is back, but not for all Mob types. MA and (incredibly) Doc type Mobs seem much less inclined to chain heal than Adventurer types. Advs are the real pains and even light greens can take a very long time to wear down.

A tip for upsetting a chain healer... Go find yourself a grey or dark green mob with no healing nanos and low HP (like an NT) and let them double team you. Attack the weak mob and it'll act like a nano sink for the chain healer as the healer repeatedly tries to keep its health up. By the time you get to the healer it's got either no nano or very low nano...

Cheers,

Bjond @ 11/26/2001 3:42:02 AM (1784):
I noticed a dramatic increase in the ammount of junk (mostly clothing) as mission rewards since 13.1.  I'd say about 30% of all rewards are worthless clothing.  And, yes, I've noticed that NCU's are completely absent beyond about q30 on missions.

OTH, I also noticed that you can get Stigma rifles as rewards again.  They're incredibly rare -- about like 6 slot belts were pre-13.1 -- but they're out there.

Every patch that alters the item database also alters the mission rewards, sometimes drastically.  IMHO, this is entirely inadvertent.  I don't think Funcom has any control over the individual rarities on items in missions.

Bjond @ 11/26/2001 3:54:15 AM (1359):
It's not fixed.  I can recreate it at will and did so within 5 minutes of checking to see if the 13.1 patch actually did any of the things it said it did.  It's damn easy to duplicate:

. start fight v. multiple critters
. target critter you're not hitting
. when first critter dies, hit 'q'
. observe the can't start fight message
. hit 'q' again
. take it easy
. hit 'q' again
. take it easy
. note that you're not attacking anything
. wonder how long until your next special attack refreshes
. hit 'q' again
. take it easy
. note that brawl refreshed
. hit 'b' and watch the fight start (finally)
. if you don't have specials (eg. agents, traders, some others) time to rezone

Switching targets is horribly bugged.  Someone messed around with the combat code on the client and never tested it (reload now broken, dual wield timing is broken, etc).  If you can find new bugs within minutes of patching, that means it wasn't tested.

Bjond @ 11/26/2001 4:06:36 AM (1244):
The zone/buff/debuff bug on fist+weapon has been around for a long long time.  I think I first reported it shortly after release.  IIRC, I didn't try fist+wep in beta.  This is an incredibly trivial bug for them to fix -- they regenerate the character on zone, there's no excuse for fists not to be part of that.  They regenerate the fist on buff/debuff, there's no excuse not to add a dual fist+wep check at the same time.  These are small changes to existing code.

They've been saying "we're working on it" for 3 or 4 months now.  I don't think they are.  Instead of bug fixes, we get rocks that fly out of our guns, changes to the chat colors, shops that have no items, nerfs to complit & implanting, time-wasting missions that will no longer stack to the same location, and MOBs that have insane AC.  It's obvious they're doing things, but testing and fixing bugs are not on that list.

addona @ 11/26/2001 4:09:48 AM (Bugged eye implant 1828):
Just wondered if anyone at funcom was aware that combining a faded manual marksmanship cluster with any ql eye implant results in a bugged "?" implant and does not give the skill points.IM guessing no one knows seeing as im the only person on Ruby-Kai who uses a bow , but that is going to be a whole seperate threadd about the bows and their inferiority towards all other weapons.

Pants, skirt, and fem. top don't add treatment.  There's another piece that adds treatment, but not first aid -- I reported them all, but I've forgotten which one doesn't add first aid.

BTW, every time I run into someone that says the pants/skirt or fem. top works for them, I ask them to try it and see, but watch their skills while they put the item on.  So far, I've never found someone that could put the item on/off in front of me and watch their treatment go up.

Bauxite @ 11/26/2001 5:17:54 AM (1640):
Heres something else to add, that I discovered with some friends.

Take two people with different runspeeds, we used someone with 150 and another with 80.

The 80 ran along, and the 150 ran along, obviously the 150 got ahead of him.

However, if the 150 used /follow, eventually the 80 could LOSE the 150, he was literally outrunning him and leaving him in the dust once he got 80m ahead or so. (whatever the max viewdist is)

We even stuck tank on the 80 to bring him down to <60, and used a general +30 to get the other guy to 180.

Guess what? Same results...

Now, if it was 50 run versus 500 run, you might get different results, but when its 60 versus 180 and this happens, sure makes you wonder WTF is going on eh?

I talked to a guy in my guild with two computers (and accounts) and he said he had noticed this awhile back. One of his chars would get in a yalmaha just so it wouldn't get 'left behind' on long treks, even though his other char was 30 levels and 100 run more.

Also, once you lose your /follow target, you keep running....quite annoying if your party is going to a far off camp and you need to graba  quick snack, bathroom break etc...

allenfox @ 11/26/2001 5:17:55 AM (Take it easy / missions still horked 1834):
Thought the 13.0 or 13.1 patch notes said they fixed the "take it easy" bug and that the missions were all working now.  Still having the same old lame problems with take it easy and missions not working.  Anyone else still seeing these problems?

Liloo @ 11/26/2001 5:22:04 AM (1640):
Yes spydr that sounds about right.

When I was lower level I could blitz through missions easily with my runspeed buffs.  But, now at my level I'm so fast I lag everytime I change rooms (1038 runspeed).  The run buffs seem to be more pronounced the higher the runspeed is.

The game code base is huge! As far as I know they are hiring so if you know what it takes then apply!
			
		
	
I don't really think AO qualifies as huge.  I think it probably barely qualifies as moderate in size.  It typically doesn't take a new engineer more than a week at the very most to be productive no matter how big the code base is.  When it takes longer, that's when it's time to really think about letting them go before the typical "30 day trial" period is up.  It's a lot easier to fire early than late.

I also don't think they can afford real engineering talent.  In fact, I'd bet they think they don't need it or even that they already have it.  The reason most games are so buggy is that game programmers are scraping the bottom of the barrel -- they earn about 1/3 what you'd have to pay to recruit top 10%.  Then again, most games are disposable products the publisher expects to be thrown away after a month.  You typically don't need real engineering talent for that -- better to spend your talent money on imagination instead: designers, artists, and such.

An MMORPG is not a typical game, though.  You don't want people to use it and toss it.  This is more like a mainstream application. It costs less to get it right the first time.  'Course you could use the AO model and drag it out over years and years while some newbie plays around tweaking the code over and over at the investor's and customer's expense.  Ah, yes, now there's a good recipe for making money!

BTW, as to *applying*, LOL, that's not how things work.  I haven't done that in 15 years.  I don't even know anyone worth hiring that has.  If someone wants to hire me, they need to ask nicely and have an interesting (and lucrative) project.  I think AO would fail on both counts there.

Misophist @ 11/26/2001 6:33:47 AM (1543):
Yes, Muftak. I'm a particularly stupid MA. But I do know of this:

Velocity: Increases the Run Speed of the target by 70 points. Bio Met, Sense Imp 289.

Are you saying there's another run speed buff as well, also called Velocity, that gives +30? Because that would follow the conversation in this thread, and I'm a bit confused. Please clarify.

Bjond @ 11/26/2001 6:34:15 AM (1771):
Actually, the names should be unique across all the servers.  I had to delete my "Bjond" agent on RK1 before I could create a character with the same name on RK2.

BTW, they'll have to do an IP wipe before they can mix RK1 and RK2.  Ka-2 missed out on many of the IP exploits and even valid IP-rings were never available on Ka-2.  IMHO, I expect Ka-2 to close down soon and all the chars be migrated to Ka-1.  The server population on Ka-2 is almost as low as the test server.

Re_animator @ 11/26/2001 8:06:37 AM (Petition problems 1849):

If there is no one on that is available to take my petition then i should get a message saying "there is no one available to take your petition. Please try later"  If the GM can't do anything for me the I should get a message saying "I'm sorry please contact AO/FUNCOM support at www.yadayadayada.com" I sat in front of a store for 3 hours after my 4.6 million credit plane just vanished and my inventory was not full.  I still dont know what happened because i haven't recieved an email back or any advice from the petitions i put in 7 times.

Ah yes, I'm a programmer too. Maybe the programs I see are a bigger mess than what you usually get

MORB @ 11/26/2001 12:54:55 PM (1640):
bjode: I think it's only a timing problem with the client, but it probably don't actually affect your run speed. The client extrapolate your position from the last received info from the server, and depending on the framerate, it does not do it properly I think.
In some place when running in reet form, I teleport forward every second or so, because of this I think.

And in /follow mode, you never run faster than your target, so your run speed is probably reduced to that of the target (if you're faster than it).

Taelyn @ 11/26/2001 4:15:49 PM (1640):
I've noticed it too.  I have an adventurer with both the +100 and reet speed buffs (190).  I can get a top speed of 550 or so.  Despite this, I've noticed that the +100 buff alone seems to do absolutely nothing, its only when I put the reet buff on that I seem to actually move at a different rate.

Of course, this could be the form.  In Leet form, everything looks fast.  hehe.

Im the hired gun thats brought in to fix em hehe.

I used to work at a software company and there were some really good people there, and some really bad ones.  Now I do consulting and I get to clean up after the bad ones... but the pay is good

Scorus @ 11/26/2001 5:27:16 PM (Nano creation tools prices? 1896):
Since other prices have been bugged before, I'm hoping these are also. The Isotope Separator and Neutron Displacers that are necessary to create nanocrystals each cost over 200K at QL25. The other tools are much more reasonably priced, but these two drive the cost of making a nanocrystal over half a million credits. I know they are reusable but, like all AO equipment, they will have to be replaced by the better quality stuff soon.

If you intend Nanocrystal creation to be a viable tradeskill (which you may not, given the number of skills require to do it), bring the cost of these two tools down to the level of the others.

Mr. Bogus @ 11/26/2001 5:37:05 PM (Lost XP? 1898):
OK, has this happened to anybody? I had just hit level 60 and was returning to the outpost in lush fields. I was in my car and looking at a gun I wanted to build the skills needed to wield it. I needed to increase Assult Rife, Aim Shot and Range Engery, which I did. I checked twice, looking at the Req's for the gun and then looking at my skills, before I hit accept. 

But after I hit accept, the XP just vanished. Only one skill (ranged energy) took. The other 2 skills (Assult rifle and Aim Shot) went back the previous settings and I lost the XP. 

Was this because I was in my car? Can FC give them back? I figure if I remove all my implants and then petition FC, they  should be able to tell if I'm short on XP for my level. Since there is no way to give XP away or drop them on the ground, it would prove that I got robbed.

Anybody know if this will work? I worked hard for my XP and would hate to see my main character gimped over a bug.

Tedric @ 11/26/2001 5:51:24 PM (1896):
Agreed. If you want the tradeskill system to ever get used, the tool (and parts) prices have to be reasonable. Currently in order to make a low-level nano you need several "not found in stores" parts + tools that cost around 500,000 credits. It's no wonder that even low-quality self-made nanos are going at prices that only eBay-exploiters will be able to afford.

Mr. Bogus @ 11/26/2001 5:53:07 PM (1891):
Nope but computer literacy does. Don't ask me why but a bunch of my guild mates were in a shop looking at an Air Vic and the price was different (higher) to me then them. At one's suggestion, I buffed my CL and looked again and low and behold, the price dropped. Go figure.

After 12.8 we were told that we would be "guaranteed" a token if we killed all monsters and none of them were grey. Numerous people have reported that when they go on the small missions with 2-8 MOBs, they often do not get a token. I find that I get one about 50% of the time in those cases. You keep asking us to trust you, saying that this relationship cannot work without trust. Yet we keep getting fed incomplete or incorrect information.

I have no problem with mass murder mission cuz i'm a lvl 115 Soldier with a ql200 Nova..


But I do think their should be job specific missions, related to the profession of the player. Maybe a mission for only speeding through for the fixer, where mobs are designed just for chasing.

Or where the mobs are OT police.

Maybe implementing some Grid Guards that check papers and items before you enter, and a fixer holding foodsacks for spiking would have to break this guard...etc..

Specie @ 11/26/2001 6:22:38 PM (Unable to use items or interact with objects/persons 1904):
here i try again

seems my last message dissapeared somehow

Problem:
In a mission it has happened quite often (during fights) that it suddenly is not possible to use items by right clicking them. The same applies to trying to opening chests, loot NPC's/Mobs, etc. It also doesnt work trying to use in item by activating it through the action bar. Nano spells and special attacks work though.

It seems that the only fix is to zone and go back in again. Deselecting and reselecting myself doesnt work. So this is a different bug than the earlier mentioned regarding Nano and First aid kits. 

This happens to me in almost every mission and is very annoying and dangerous. Annoying because the mission map dissapears when exiting mission area. Dangerous because its no fun being along way into a mission area fighting multiple mobs when all of a sudden nano & health rechagers/kits stop working.

So please fix this.

And also make maps stay when i exit a mission area that is not complete.

Nutbar03 @ 11/26/2001 6:23:10 PM (1901):
On the flip side there seem to be an awful lot of mission with GIGANTIC maps.  If kill 30 MOBs and find the item halfway through one of these I always get a token, even though there are 30 more still alive.

Icaria @ 11/26/2001 6:58:03 PM (1795):
I have to agree, I have been trying to gain control of the mission sliders with both my L33 Fixer and my L44 MA.  The spread is way out of the realm.  I also don't want nor need to fight grays, as stated it is a waste of time.  I also don't need to take on dark oranges or reds that do more damage than I can even consider and heal faster than I can do damage.  (I have actually pumped hundreds of rounds into ONE before running out of nano energy and first aid kits and having no choice but to bail.

Saw somewhere they are thinking about adding a "distance" slider to allow that choice.  But why?  The already have two sliders that could be incorporated in to one with the main slider and the good / bad slider.  If I make it difficult am I also going to make it bad?

To me it's obvious they are trying to make the individual mission terminals' dual purpose.  Make the team mission terminals the ONLY way to team missions, have the key duplicator ONLY duplicate team mission keys and then adjust the individual mission terminals to make it real for single players.  Or does that sound too simple?  <chuckle>

Icaria @ 11/26/2001 7:12:39 PM (1849):
Sometimes they are just buried.  I sometimes get replies, I sometimes get a visit from a helpful ARK and I sometimes get ignored.  And sometimes ignoring me is a GOOD thing as sometimes my petitions are made when I am highly incensed!  If I were them I, too, would ignore "Roll this game up in to a tight tube and . . . . . .!"  <smile>

As far as the loss of items, experience points, etc., I have to feel for them as it's difficult to tell those who honestly have a problem with those who will lie, cheat and steal (or sit on a grid or whompa and ambush the unaware) to get ahead as they are either unable to succeed or unwilling to work.  Gee, starting to sound like real life!

I have thought about this a bit and there is no easy answer as to log every move of every player would be a considerable resource hog.  And could YOU pass the test of determining who is trying to play the system and who isn't?  Again, as in real life, we all pay for the few who have no scruples and will cheat anyone to get ahead.

I have also asked myself what it would cost them to just give the items or experience points to the player.  It would cost them nothing but time.  It would cost us, the players, a lot.  Once we saw those who are cheaters getting away with it we might say, "Gee, why not?" and do it ourselves.  That would increase the workload for them and make the game rather without any value to us.

But my question is, just where in the world did you find 4.6 million credits?  <grin>

Mr. Bogus @ 11/26/2001 7:40:14 PM (1849):
I would agree with you on items but XP? How can you fake that? At a given level, with no implants installed, you would have a given about of XP, anything less, would be a bug. Simple math should tell FC if player got robbed or not. There is no way to drop, transfer or sale XP. So if you have less then you should have, you have been bug raped. 

PS, this just happened to me and it hurts.

RoboKa @ 11/26/2001 8:26:34 PM (The game stole my jet! 1921):
I'm a level 81 solitus neutral engineer on RubiKa II.  I dual weild pistols.  I DO NOT buff to equip them or use them, however, everytime I zone one of the guns de-equips.  

So, I was in the wild and I killed something with both guns equipped.  I looted and didn't realize that it filled my inventory.  I was on the way to a mission, so I equipped my Yalmaha and off I went.  This should be no problem because at the border the Yalmaha will de-equip and fill the open slot that it left when I equipped it.  And not knowing that the last loot had filled my inventory or forseeing the problem, I zoned.  Yes, you guessed it, I reached the border, the gun de-equipped filled the slot and the Yalmaha disappeared.  Gone!  Not in bank, not in backpack, not in inventory, just gone.  My Yalmaha!  /petition?  Well they showed up faster than normal, but, of course there was nothing they could do about it (as it should be, persons in positions of power must be above su****ion)!  The GM asked me to make a bug report, so here it is.  

This happened Saturday morning or afternoon (11/24/2001 between 10:00 am and 2:00pm est, I think), Please look into it and get my plane back!  I repeat this gun de-equips even though I do absolute no buffing of any sort to equip it.

These are the offending bugs: 1)If you don't buff to equip it it shouldn't de-equip. 2)De-equipping should not casue the loss of the article or any other article.

Now, can I have my Yalmaha back, please!

Note:  Fortunately, I have been lucky enough to find 2 Yalamhas in missions.  A level 40 and a level 37.  The level 40 was the one that was lost and I am using the level 37 now, so if you check my account and see that I have one, don't think that I already got it back.  I am still short the better one ant I spent extra IP to use and am now flying without security!  I feel naked out here!  Having the first het has completely changed the game for me, having the backup made it better.  But, now, seeing how easily and unjustly is was lost makes me feel affraid to do anything and has basically made the game unfun.  Please help.

Note II: I would have filed the in game bug report (Ctrl-Alt-Shift-F9) but everytime I do, the game crashes!

Now this was weird.

When the servers charshed and came back up again my character somehow warped a long distance.

When I logged in I was in the middle of a sea surrounded by piranhas. Needless to say I died and lost exp. Very annoying.

Notomni @ 11/26/2001 10:46:59 PM (1901):
What I meant was that if you put the bar to good, you will get Omni's in the mission (usually) if your clan. When talking to a GM about this, he told me that if you kill all mobs of the other side in your mission, then you will get a token, grey or not. 

Untested I cannot verify if this is true but this coming from a GM (not an ARK) is probably a pretty good source .

Another thing is in the groups I am most often with the Fixer is the puller. Fixers are great at pulling because of their speed and decent range (despite the nerf). The fixers I play with also have Movement Predictors for the range increase they need.

Soldiers can tank, but pulling is different then tanking.

There is a problem with the difficulty mobs but I posted in another thread about putting the bar on full good to get mobs of the other side of the conflict. This way you get a token no matter what for killing mobs of the other side.

This is a temporary solution, but Funcom really has to put some effort into this. 

On the other hand if they made it perfect you would know exactly what your getting in to. All missions are possible to complete with a little strategy and some tactics (possibly a few friends too)

Did ya ever think that they may have made some changes like this to maps (Galway being so high in req's) for the difficulty of the game. This game wasn't designed for the player to have it easy guys. It's a challenge. Maybe it is a bit extreme but sometimes it's made that way.

Of course it could just be like the Pistol Mastery casting time being way too high, or the Aimed Shot being outrageous pre nerf, but who knows

First of all I've been hearing people talk about how since everyone is using overequipping in AO that it should be added as a game feature. Well, I hate to say it but this as well as every game in existance is at least fragilly bound to reality.

Nelida @ 11/26/2001 11:15:23 PM (1948):
For what other purpose are there nanos to boost nearly EVERY skill but for overequipping?

For what other purpose do Traders have Wrangle nanos but for overequipping?

For what other purpose are there implants but for overequipping?

The whole game was DESIGNED around using armor and weapons over your current level and IP allocation.

And, yes, even nanos can be overequipped to a certain extent.
My Trader chain casts deprive/ransack nanos for a variety of reasons, one of which is to cast nanos she wouldn't normally be able to cast.
There are nanos to drastically buff most nano skills also, making it possible to load and cast nanos you wouldn't otherwise be able to load or cast.

Overequipping is, and has, been part of the game since its creation.

First of all I've been hearing people talk about how since everyone is using overequipping in AO that it should be added as a game feature. Well, I hate to say it but this as well as every game in existance is at least fragilly bound to reality. 

     In reality one is not able to simply become good at something, put on a piece of armor  or weapon, use it, and then when their skill level go down be able to use it. It is a falacy in any universe slighly rooted in reality, as I hope Rubi-Ka is. Personally, the idea that this can happen in any game model is pathetic. I feel that seing someone who is only at a beggining level skill be able to equip an extremely powerfull weapon/armor/implant simply ruins my experience. The fact that numerous people are doing it only makes my feeling stronger.

     For the above stated reasons I wish to make all items equiped over someone's current skill level unusible and simply left in their equipment slots. Therefore one would get no stat or skill benefits from them. 

    I aknowledge that numerous people have put significant effort into securinh weapons well over the pperson's skill level and equipping them, but since this is an obvious exploit I, at least feel that it should be dissalowed and countered. 

   In order to allow such players the abitity to use their higher level friends/donators to their advantage the tutoring skill system could be expanded to allow higher level players to help lower ones. 

Just a few thoughts.

The instantaneous death bug should be top priority, it occurs in two forms 1: You are fighting a mob, taking no damage and bam you are dead. 2: You kill a mob, are a full health and then 10 seconds later you die. I cant possibly calculate the amount of experience I have lost due to this. Its made me virutally stop playing for the past week. 
Treatment kits and first aid that you cant use until you rezone even though you are not under attack. God help you if this bug strikes you when you are deep in a mission and hit with a DOT. Not being able to target MOBS through vine doors when they are open, this has been there since day one. Total BS esp if you are an NT or other first strike necessity profession. Also I got hit with this one the other day not being able to get out of my car and then hit with the spontaneous death bug with no mobs in site. Simply awesome. Missions still suck, up the cash reward already, I still have to spend 20 mins to get to my mission and am now stuck with 1/3 of the reward. Spectacular. Im sure these are just the tip of the iceberg but I can only report it as I see it as an NT.

But since you "doubt" overequipping is a game feature maybe you should read what I wrote. How can you deny that Funcom put in SO many features with NO other purpose but to overequip?

I will say it again, this game was not designed for you.

The missions are the way they are, they set up this forum for the problems having to do with bugs and extreme problems with professions. I have no problem getting to missions, and never have. Sometimes you just have to run a little farther, get over it. 

If the game was a breeze, it would be boring, the difficulty is what makes it a challenge. A challenge is what makes it fun.

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 12:37:03 AM (1948):
Your both wrong, it isn't overequipping it's equipping. This 'overequipping' term is thrown around way to much and makes no sense. If you can use things in game, to equip items, it is equipping..no more, no less.

Then term 'twink' is also thrown around too much. Just because a lower lvl has high armor and high weapons, does not mean that he is a twink. It means he played his character right.

At lvl 115 I have a ql200 nova flow equipped. This is not overequipping, it's equipping. I will attack for much less at this lvl then I will at lvl200 because the guns skills determine the attack rating, and the gun skills are determined by IP. Stop throwing these false terms around, if you play your character right, and with patience, it is easily possible to make a "twinked" character.

Nelida @ 11/27/2001 12:38:34 AM (1951):
1. Funcom has purposely designed NUMEROUS methods of temporarily increasing skill in nearly EVERY skill. What other purpose but to equip beyond your level would all these methods be? I specifically point to MANY nanos that do NOTHING more than temporarily increase skills.

2.  I don't understand how other players play-styles affect you. Especially when ALL of us have EXACTLY the same capabilities. No single player has options that the rest of us don't have. If you CHOOSE not to overequip you can not expect to be as powerful as other players anymore than if you choose to use different and sub-standard types of weapons. 

3. How is using the Tutoring system to TEMPORARILY increase skill ANY different than using nanos, implants, wrangles or any of the other current methods? Do you somehow imagine that the Tutoring system will permanently increase skill? I certainly hope not. 

4. Again...Funcom specifically added skill enhancing nanos to the game. Some of these, such as the Traders wrangle, deprive, ransack, divest, and plunder line increases skills for a VERY short period of time. Please enlighten us as to the TRUE intended use of these nanos if you believe using them to overequip is an "exploit" and not indended by Funcom.

Your arguements, I'm afraid, do not make good sense.

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 12:40:40 AM (1899):
I think you may mean IP hehe, not XP..

XP.. is for lvling, IP is the skills used to equip items.

Nelida @ 11/27/2001 12:45:17 AM (1948):
using HIS term "overequipping" to avoid getting into a semantics argument.
My intended use is equipping beyond the ability to do so without permanent increases in skill. As I pointed out, quite obviously Funcom intended us to use temporary skill increase to equip. Otherwise they would not have created SO many methods (especially nano types) to temporarily increase skill.

And before someone argues that the nanos should be IN USE in order to use the "overequipped" item, I'd like to point out that the Traders VERY SHORT wrangle, deprive, ransack, divest and plunder line of nanos is VERY OBVIOUSLY not meant to be kept in place for the duration of using a particular item. That would simply be impossible in most cases. 

I think that the variation and types of methods that Funcom has given us clearly indicates that they INTENDED us to equip AND use items beyond our permanent skill levels.

This is getting really, really bad!  I just took an "average" mission, so low that it was taken on the Borealis terminal and the mission was in Borealis.

Got there and found three 34-V workers in the main room, tried to draw one and got three.  Took out one on the second zone, took out the second on the fourth zone and then was called away by someone who needed help.

Got back to the mission and found there were again three 34-V workers in the main room only now they were more powerful.  Finally got what appeared to be one alone in the entrance, the ONLY ONE IN THE ROOM.

34-V attacks for 36, 34, 45, 83, 44

I hit 34-V for 94 burst

34-V attacks for 36, 33, 30, 44, 35

And please don't tell me I was being hit by the others as the hits were matched by the actions of the 34-V.

Yeah, this game has become a real carload of fun and entertainment.  What do we have to do, call for a user's strike to get back to a game we can play?

There is no damage being percieved by the client, but a death signal from the server happens because it is keeping track of actual damage being given to the player. 

This is a bug.

Zaal @ 11/27/2001 2:25:20 AM (Back Pack sizes. 1973):
Ok.  Seems to me now that the small, medium, and large backpacks can now only hold a limited number of items.  And funny thing.... each of the said backpacks can only hold the same number of items each.  The limit originally in the descriptions of these items is said to be a weight but now its more of a quantity thing.  So what exactly is my reasoning for buying a large pack when it can only hold 21 individual bullets when a small backpack can also hold 21 individual bullets?

My questions then:

1- Should backpacks be limited by weight only and the finite size of them be disregarded or is there an item mass section in the items database that we palyers are unaware of?

2- If it stays the same as it is now, shouldn't larger bags have more "slots" for more items to fit in the bags?


Fin :: To me this is minor compared to all the other bugs that are prevalent in the game but I thought I would bring it up.

Lagzilla @ 11/27/2001 2:27:29 AM (943):
The most annoying bug I'm currently enduring is when using my nanos to attack (72NT here), is a critter gets close enough to trigger melee attacks, most of the time my nano casting bar hangs on the recharge cycle, forcing me to guess when I can cast again.

The other annoyance is with the use of bewilder-type spells.  All sorts of fun with this one.  I use this in conjunction with root, so I'm not 100% what part is actually failing, but what happens is:  when the root wears off, the monster then chases you down, but doesn't actually do anything.  Targetting the thing for another spell tells you 'target is out of range'.  Turns out that even though it is right beside you, either client or server thinks it is somewhere else.  Many times the monster will 'warp' back to where the original root took place.  Blast it out of existance and the final surprise-- you can't loot the body, because the body isn't really where it is being displayed.  I tested this one by zoning quickly and found that yes, indeed, my monster's corpse had teleported a dozen meters or so and I was able to loot it.

Oh--- and are the monsters SUPPOSED to get double strikes?

Lagzilla @ 11/27/2001 2:29:38 AM (1973):

I have encountered this instant death bugs a few times.

I think I know the cause.

I think Funcom knows them as well.... but I'm not sure why they can't find a good fix.

In anycase... a good way to get early warning of this bug.. is to cast a damage reflection shield on yourself.

U will see damage reflected.. but do not see damage being done on you. That is a sure sign that someone is hitting u and yet your client is not reporting... ie. time to bail out or shout for heals.

Ashuras @ 11/27/2001 2:46:38 AM (1960):
I think Notorian has a serious problem. Are u trying to drive people away from the game ?

Could u at least help or give constructive comments instead of insulting others ?

Icaria... are u saying the mobs respawned ? Or that they hit too damm fast ? Or wat ? Please be more specific. Thanks.

Ashuras @ 11/27/2001 2:52:06 AM (1359):
I have managed to consistently reproduce the TAKE IT EASY bug in live yesterday.

THe worst part is... specials does not work as well. There was no way for me to get rid of it... except to relog (maybe zoning might help... or offensive NFs.... which I don't have).

Here is what I did:

1) Pull a train of mobs
2) Run away from them until they give up chase
3) I will see a few Attacked by -NONE- messages
4) Find any other mobs...
5) Try pressing Q. --> Take it easy.

Damm irritating.

I hope some Funcom DEV reads this board and thread.

Ashuras @ 11/27/2001 2:55:35 AM (318):
Ok.. here's more...

Sometimes I get this bug... even F8->3rdpersonview->MouseClick-to-target-self does not work.

Neither does ESC-F1.

What finally worked was... cast some NF. It seems to get rid of the targetting problem.

Ashuras @ 11/27/2001 3:05:13 AM (Instant Death Bug 1979):
This is a well known bug. Here's is a report one site where it could be reproduced consistently:

The location is Pleasant Meadows, at the shades camp in 1800, 1200.

U just need to target a shae inside the camp behind one of those picket lines.

Then run back.

If the shades get STUCK behind those picket lines. They are so dumb in their path finding that they don't know how to get out.

But.. unfortunately.. they are still doing "invisible" hits on you that are not reported by the client.

And.. tada... u're dead.

If u managed to survive long enuf even though u're being pummeled by these invisible mobs... they will eventually TELEPORT right in front of u. And u will be spammed with delayed damage reports.

The only way I could detect such a bug right now is to use a damage reflection shield. For some reason.. the client could tell that I was being hit.. and thus reported the reflected damage... but it doesn't report that actual damage being done on me.
Weird.

BTW, the damage reflection trick is not fool proof... there are occasions when I still died from such a bug with NOTHING being reported.

Thrin @ 11/27/2001 4:16:41 AM (1979):
I died twice in different missions by an "instant death."  I didn't see any damage being done to me (no messages in window).  But there was a monster nearby stuck on one occassion and the other time I was running away and monster was stuck several rooms away.

Thrin @ 11/27/2001 4:23:27 AM (1960):
I though I was just seeing things but I had something similar happen.  I had a mission with 3 'Waste Anacondas' or something in the main room.  I killed one... zoned..killed another...zoned and then I notced that there were still 3 in there, when there was only one after last zone.

I assumed that maybe two more from nearby rooms aggroed but that would be a first.  

Anyone else have something like this happen?

What happened to you was a little different that what my character experienced.  I didn't loose any IP, it was more as if the accept button was the same as the cancel button.  Your bug is definitely far worse than mine, though.  The only fix for yours is an IP reset.  I still have my IP, I just can't spend it.

Bjond @ 11/27/2001 5:37:46 AM (1784):
I think they have some control, but that what they have control over is a set of IDs rather than items.  My guess is that they provide a set of item IDs that the mission generator randomly chooses from based mostly on reward QL and that they don't make sure these IDs correlate with changes to the item database.  So, when the db changes, the IDs now select a different set of items than they did last patch.

Sooner or later (2 or 3 patches from now), someone will match up the IDs again and you'll see another seemingly inexplicable shift.  I don't give Funcom devs much credit, but you'd have to be a complete ninny to deliberately add a pair of boxers as a potential reward for a q100+ mission.  The devs are pretty bad, but I really don't think they're that inept.

BTW, 6-slot belts start at QL-160, which is pretty far beyond the current QL-125 limit in superior shops.  Also, the lead designer keeps trying to nerf NCU's and belts.  Maybe you're right and they were deliberately removed as a silent nerf.

Bjond @ 11/27/2001 5:51:41 AM (1640):
You can try it and see.  I run in Window mode all the time and often swap out to check e-mail and such while playing (or check AO while working -- depends ).  If you minimize the window instead of just putting it in the backgroud while running, your runspeed goes sky-high.  You can run *through* buildings and other solid obstacles if you don't watch out.  It's pretty dangerous -- you can get stuck in the terrain very easily and sometimes it bugs up your character and you'll start rubber-banding all over like a flea on a hotplate until you log out.  So, now I just don't minimize the window, it's way too buggy.

Ashuras @ 11/27/2001 6:54:15 AM (ADV Morph Bugs 1996):
1) WHen fighting in Morphed form using ranged weapons.... there seems to be some kind of LAGged response. After the fight, we would see streamers of tracers fire (our ranged weapon firing animation) shooting across where we last engaged a mob. 

It looks like just a cosmetic bug, but it does cause some performance issues and seems to slow things down.

2) Wolf and Tiger form, sit down animation/position is bugged.
When I sit... the wolf/tiger remained standing. It's only after I stand up that the avatar goes into the "sat down" form.

This is another cosmetic bug... which I think should not be hard to fix. 

These are NOT top priority bugs, but hope Funcom could fix them if these problems don't take too much time to solve.

Toser Ban @ 11/27/2001 9:06:29 AM (1741):
I had a similar problem a few days ago. I could raise a skill until all my IP was spent, but when I clicked "accept" and opened the skill panel again all these IP were back in the pool and the skill on the level it was before.

After trying it a couple of times I suddenly noticed that I was able to put more IP into my skill than I had in the pool! In fact, when I started to raise my skill I noticed that the amount of IP in the pool went up. This is obviously a bug.

Now, to solve my problem, I just raised my skill for the amount of IP I had in the pool when I opened the skill panel. That worked for me.

In the meantime the problem seems to have disappeared (maybe because I leveled a few times since then) but I will explicitly check for it again later today.

Andai @ 11/27/2001 9:48:30 AM (Stuck in non-damage mode while fighting 2003):
I've done missions with my 60-ish soldier the past week. During the numerous fights i've been in i've noticed that the battle sequence (of miss-hit-miss-hit) gets out of sync every now and then. I end up doing only hits sometimes, with the "miss" shot not present, and at other times i do the miss-hit animations almost simultaneously. The really frustrating thing is that i every now and then end up with a miss-miss sequence, meaning only the miss animation is going through and the hit animation, including the actual hit, is left out completely. 

This couldn't simply be a case of me missing my target could it? It seems strange to me that i would hit the mob as usual and all of a sudden i won't hit anything for 5-7 shots, then my gun reloads and then i start to hit at a normal rate again.

I've tried several different things to get out of this lethal loop of non-damage but the only foolproof way i've found is when one of the specials recycles. If i fling or burst this ususally fixes things and i'm back at doing a miss-hit-miss-hit sequence. Besides using specials i've tried jumping (as this was mentioned as a "fix" in an ancient patch long ago) and it seem to work sometimes, but not always. If i jump between attack animations so that i'm in the air when the shot is fired it seems to set things straight, but if i jump without a shot being fired while mid-air i just land as stand there with my character in a non-combat position until the battle sequence hits and i return to a battle stance (more often than not without me being able to land a hit).

Have anyone else experienced something like this recently?

I was not aware the Dev's were trying to eliminate NCU related items. Considering this game is completely reliant on NCU's due to buffs for equipping things, and also the high NCU doc/ac/attack buffs that the professions aquired. I think that if the 6 slot belts are not reconsidered and reimplemented into the lineup it will be very unfair to those who do not have them now, and those who do will have a substantial advantage.

I was not trying to insult anyone. I'm sorry if I did.

I just wanted to point out that most of the people I know if properly equipped can handle missions. And yes, it is quite easy for someone my level to have ql200 items equipped. At level 112 you can roll ql200 missions so it is pretty simple to see how I achieved this.

No, I didn't want to insult anybody..just point out that it might not always be the games fault

I've known (and been annoyed) about that bug/feature for a long time.  It's just annoying, and I'd rather they work on more important things.  Like fixing the game.

Icaria @ 11/27/2001 3:42:56 PM (1960):
"Icaria... are u saying the mobs respawned ? Or that they hit too damm fast ? Or wat ? Please be more specific. Thanks"

Sorry, thought it was specific.  And the answer is "yes".  <smile> While I was off helping another in the game the 34-Vs seemed to have respawned.  Didn't know that could happen in a mission.  I left with two out of three down and returned to three out of three up.

But my main concern, regardless of what Notorian feels, is the way just one 34-V was hitting.  Note it hit me five times, I fired a burst, it hit me five times and I hit the door!  If anyone can survive a 5 to 1 hit ratio with a MOB of supposedly equal level then more power to him.  I certainly can't, and this was with a level 33 Fixer.

I don't want to become a tweak freak, I don't to spend all my time learning how to cheat the system, I just want a level playing field so I can go in and complete a mission without it being all gray.

"I assumed that maybe two more from nearby rooms aggroed but that would be a first."

Not really, on one mission there were three in the main room.  My son tried to pull one ( an exercise in futility ) and the next thing I knew we were in the entrance room with FIVE!  But that was with "normal" MOBs and with some zoning in and out we took `em one at a time. 

Again last night, my son (level 44 Agent) and my level 44 MA almost didn't complete a mission because of the way the MOBs are able to heal and the way the hit points increase for the MOB while dropping for us, not to mention the way they now agro from a couple of rooms away.

I'm not in to PvP and see no challange in tweaking and buffing and doing whatever I can so I can kill another player.  Been there, done that, have the tee-shirt.  Just want to enjoy the game as I used to.  Hopefully the Wednesday changes will help.

[whine]
MAs are totally gimped in pvp and near complete gimpdom in pvm.   Missions totally suck right now... if I chose a 50% mission with human npc, I cant do them cause of the minimum damage bug, crazy regen bug, and the massive ammounts of hp they have.  If I chose a mission that is all robots or animals, I end up with the full grey robot missions.  I had 3 straight completely grey 50% missions last night.  I did one just to see if there was any greens at all in there.... nope, not a one (I did get a mission token and about 7k xp from opening locked chests and doors hehe).

I dont to pvp because its pointless as an MA.  Enter pvp zone, get rooted, nuked or shot to death, changing area.....

I am finding it nearly impossible to do missions, whicb I used to love to do.

maybe I should throw some IPs into one of my blue tradeskills so I have something to do til Funcom makes the game playable again.  The game has been balanced against the uber-equipped twinks and classes like MAs and caster classes who cant really over-equip are suffering for it.

At least Shadows of Luclin comes out next week.  At least I can go back to EQ for a while til Funcom fixes the damn completely broken game.  As it stands right now, the game is too frustrating to play.
[/whine]

I realize this is gonna fall on deaf ears, but I gotta do something.   I really love the game, or at least the games potential, and I would like to see this become a fun, balanced mmorpg, not the unbalanced, unfun, version of quake that we play now.

that says it all right there.

One of the key reasons the game balance is so out of whack is over-equipping classes like Soldiers and Agents.

Try playing a NT or an MA who cant over-equip to the levels you can and then say that.  MA fist damage is capped... it wont get any higher no matter what you do... how are we supposed to get better gear when our fists are only so effective?  And dont even mention the MA weapons since they are so broken right now its not even funny.

So please, mr L33t gamer, please explain to us how we can over-equip like your soldier?

Icaria @ 11/27/2001 3:59:22 PM (2029):
"I realize this is gonna fall on deaf ears, but I gotta do something. I really love the game, or at least the games potential, and I would like to see this become a fun, balanced mmorpg, not the unbalanced, unfun, version of quake that we play now."

You might be surprised, but that's not true.  While they can't possibly respond to every message I know for a fact they are reading and they are paying attention.  Had a "visit" while online last night and there's no doubt in my mind they are not only reading but they are paying attention.

And I agree with your assessments on missions.  Luckily I team with a Level 44 Agent, and the MA with an Agent seems to make for a good small team as our attack capabilities cover most of the bases.  When my hits seem to drop his are OK and vice versa.  I often see my melee hits capped, instead of varying they will suddenly be 56 - 56 - 56 - 56 - 56 - and then maybe a 96 brawl where they had been from 22 - 218 with higher brawl damage.  Or I'll be attacking for heavy points and noticing him taking all the shield damage with low hits.

But my Fixer?  I'm looking for a Mausser water pistol as I stand a better chance of drowning the little *******!

Chimar @ 11/27/2001 4:06:26 PM (1948):
I would have no problem with so-called over-equipping, if everyone had at least some ability to do it.  Not everyone can equip that uber nova-flow and take out orange mobs....

Icaria @ 11/27/2001 5:11:20 PM (1948):
Isn't the language wonderful?  <chuckle>  I have watched folks saying the same things in different ways making it look like an argument.

OK, let's say that Funcom gave us the capability of wearing armor a little beyond our capabilities.  Question is, why did they then start giving the MOBs capabilities that negate those abilities?

Make it simple.  A few weeks ago I could go out on a mission all by my lonesome, fight my way through in maybe an hour or less, make some credits and considerable experience points.  In that few weeks I have, of course, made my character wear better armor and wield a better weapon.  But now I can't get through a mission at all, in most cases, and when I do the experience points gained is pathetic when compared to just a few weeks ago.

I didn't have to spend a lot of time trying to create a super character then, why should I be forced to do it now?  I made the suggestion they put it all back as it was and play with the mission terminals so the users can do it to themselves.  Capable of taking on three reds and a red mission?  More power to you!  Just crank those mission sliders to the right and go at it.  Want greens and yellows?  Move the sliders 20% to 50% to the right and find the "sweet spot" for your character.  Only got an hour for a quick mission?  Add a "distance" slider to allow taking a local mission for less credits, and a lower reward, BUT LEAVE THE MOBs ALONE!

Make the team mission terminals work and only allow team mission keys to be duplicated to fill the needs of the members of the team.  Or assure all team members hit the team terminal.  Make the team missions more difficult by the number of team members and then allow the same controls as the single mission terminals.

In other words, let the players create their destiny and allow them to play the game they want to play.  Very difficult for a player to complain about a mission they are pretty much fully in control of.  Now that's not saying they won't complain, it just makes it more difficult.  <chuckle>

Hiero @ 11/27/2001 5:41:40 PM (Stupid Root(sp?) whilst zoning bug. 2051):
In a mission in Varment Woods with my Enforcer.  I forget now which mob was attacking (not much help I know)...but I was in the entrance room.  I was getting attacked and my health was getting very low.  So I zoned out...at the same instant I zoned the mob cast a root(sp?) on me.  Still I was able to zone...

However on the otherside of the zone...I was rooted.  I check my NCU window to see how long until it would wear off.  It was empty.  So...I waited, and waited...and waited.  Nothing.  Seems the root was infinte.  Obviously I couldn't sit down...so I typed /quit.

When I logged back in I was okay again.  It weird though.

Was in a mission in Newland Desert, I can't remember what type of mob was attacking me now (not much help I know)...

Anyways I was in the entrance room...and my health was getting pretty low.  So I tried to zone out...but...opps...I left it too late.  Just as I was zoning I died at the exact same moment.  Well the screen all went white.  But when it came back I was standing outside my mission with all my equipment still.  Everything carried on as though I hadn't died.

Weird.  If you need any more info let me know.

Luxxan @ 11/27/2001 6:03:53 PM (1359):
If your special also does not work (I've had this problem), target something you cannot attack, like a fellow player or teammate, and try to attack them.  This will clear the Take It Easy.

Also, if you guys can reproduce these bugs, please, for the love of God, send a feedback with the way you did it.  Don't just assume that everyone else knows how these things work too.  Their programmers have to spend precious time trying to figure out what the heck is going on when all players do is say "wtf my gun desnt wrk WTF" constantly.

From day one it has seemed that the "testing scripts" (if they exist) for the combat code expected everyone to finish every battle they "start or get into".  The code really needs some work in the "run away restart later" area and the "I gave up on that guy I want to fight this guy" areas.

I really wish it was simple to change combat targets like every other MMORPG out there

I guess my post was misunderstood, I can see how a soldier would have no complaints. But when I have to spend 40k to restock myself every few missions with Recharge kits that are twice as expensive as treatment kits I think we nano-based professions have a problem. I wasnt complaining about the distance! I want the missions back to the way they were before when I could actually support myself. I want missions further away! The rewards used to be 3 times what they are now. Thats my gripe. Frankly Notorian keep your comments to yourself. You chose the easy route let the chronically nerfed professions have their say.

I've had situations where that doesn't work either, so I've found the best solution so far is to just manually re-target yourself with your cursor. Do press ESC to cancel any target you have though first.

cman @ 11/27/2001 8:52:21 PM (1969):
Ayabe, he has a point though, give some detail of whats wrong.

The bug he is reporting doesnt work the same for everyone, my Body Dev implant gives me LOTS of HPs, more than a life one in the same slot would.

cman @ 11/27/2001 8:59:18 PM (1784):
i do have a feeling that ncu and belts were removed from the reward table intentionally while they got the comp lit buff nerf in or something.

but we really need em back in the game now

NCU's are almost as vital as armor, at my lvl the average buff me and my teammates run uses over 40ncu's, with a 5deck belt and ql125 ncu's the most u can get is 178 ncu's. 178 dont cut it, we allready have to jack up our comp lit to crazy levels to use em now, but at least give us a chance to use em if we do raise our comp lit

i group with a MP on occasion, she has the nifty +90 nano skill buffs...she can totally fill her NCUs with nano skills buffs alone, of course she has to go *totally* buffless to do it, cant even squeeze in a doc HP buff, she has the comp lit to equip at least ql170 NCUs, and would have plenty of NCUs if she could just obtain em, thats just wrong

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 10:20:33 PM (1784):
So true, the MP I group with has the same trouble for the same reasons. She has a 6 belt but no NCU's to filll it.

Please make this a sticky thread, especially considering the importance of the topic and the fact that it is rarely addressed.

I'd also like to point out that my fellow guildmates and I took the time to map out and note the quality levels in which a player can roll NCU's in the mission booths and now that is for nothing, and there is nothing to show for it. I would sincerely like this to be put very high on the list of things to come in future patches (maybe I should have started the thread in that topic instead) .

I don't know if any of you have ever tried a Doctor mob, but their insane. What you said about mobs regening slower may be true, but the fact that the mobs can heal for 1/3 of their hp makes it a little different.

In a team with the highest doc, highest fixer, 2 soldiers (including me) the highest MP and the highest NT (on RK2) in 1 team, it took us about 15 minutes to kill a Veteran Doctor. As for the other mobs it took us half that time, at the most.

Mobs regening may be fixed, but healing is pretty insane.

Missions are a nice way to get free clothes. At low levels some of the clothes can seem expensive and when you want that trench coat or sunglasses you can always try to get one as a mission reward.  I think clothes are very cool.

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 10:28:26 PM (1784):
Archu it may be great for lower levels, but at my lvl a few hundred credits isn't going to help much, maybe suggesting a level restriction on certain items that can be rolled despite the fact that their all ql1.

Perhaps after the level 20, clothes become much more rare?

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 10:34:37 PM (1960):
Implants, simple as that..

Your attack rating and your damage is directly related to your MA skill, so if you buff MA skill with nice high implants you can easily raise your damage. Yes I understand that you won't be able to hit as much as me perhaps at the same level, but to put it in perspective the MA I play with (135 I believe..) crit brawls for 2k+. Now saying crit brawl might not be that effective because it is a crit, but because he has a 13+ crit nano, and soon able to use the 19+ (maybe 18, I can't remember off hand) he does considerable damage.

Not to mention being able to heal quite well (have grouped many times with just him healing) and the fact that he has very nice MA special attacks which can be bought at Superior Shops like Blessed With Thunder or Bird of Prey etc..

MA's do very nice damage at my level. So I have to equip guns that high just to keep up to them

That sometimes happens when I solo hard missions. The entry room gets flooded with yellow-red enemies. It is very hard but I  try to kill one of them wile constantly healing myself with first aid and nano healings. When one dies or I am about to die, I go outside (heal) and depending on the situation I wait till my burst has recharged. 

Then just back in and kill one. Repeat a few times and they are all dead.

Archu @ 11/27/2001 10:38:04 PM (1954):
That insta-gib has happened to me only once. Not a biggie for me.

Notomni @ 11/27/2001 10:44:22 PM (1954):
Tard, nice vocabulary first of all. Secondly, the soldier has had it's fair share of nerfs too..

Perhaps you don't remember the days when MK shield REFLECTED damage instead of just absorbing it. Or how about when they nerfed both special attacks of the soldier, the Burst and the Full Auto.

And if you mean by missions returning back to normal meaning area nucing through doors (which I hope you don't) then you have no say in what should happen at all.

If you sincerely believe that you should be able to solo missions, maybe you should not have picked a nanomage NT?...Very blatantly in the description it says their lack of HP.

Yes this is a bug that needs to be fixed, but 1 issue at a time. Your profession and the instakill bug is 2 very different topics.

cson @ 11/27/2001 11:21:33 PM (1960):
As far as MAs go at higher levels, they hit very well against non-NPC mobs, but hit minimum damage agaist NPCs. As far MA attacks, you can't buy anything higher than QL125 from shops, and the MA attacks are NODROP so you can't buy it from higher level players. At lvl 90 with QL125 implants, I can crit three times in a row for 1800 each when I'm lucky. If I'm not lucky, I'll be hitting a yellow Bully for 92 ten times in a row with a 200 brawl. 

The best thing going for MAs right now is the crit buff, but soon other classes are going to have it, making MAs kind of like fixers. 

I think Funcom nerfs one class at a time so people will keep rerolling their characters. By making it nearly impossible to level at higher levels, people will continue to reroll and continue to play AO.

Meegor @ 11/28/2001 12:29:45 AM (1960):
why does any post like this turn into a "Im uber , your not " thing.  

 IMHO missions are really whacked right now. ..all kinds of weirdness going on,  and its not just me,  my guildmates have all experianced all kinds of strange things.   I had an instance similar to the original poster,  had me so frustrated, I brought in another one of my charactors (my boyfriends account) to help me clear the main room.  that charactor is  super twinked Enforcer 22 levels higher than my NT.  OKAY here is where it gets strange.  These mobs,  (rookie thugs , atrox) conned yellow to orange to me at 34.  There were 3 of them...2 orange one yellow.   My enforcer comes in,  to my bewilderment,   at 55 they con green to him!!!!!  after a bit of a battle , he manages to clear the room.  Next room , same thing....can you tell me there is not something SERIOUSLY wrong with this picture?????   HOW can a mob con yellow and orange to a 34 and GREEN to a 55???  

OOOH and whats up with the missions terminal giving out CLOTHES  for rewards 6 out of 10 rolls?  

Yes they fixed the terminals giving missions too far away, but in the meantime , other aspects of the system are getting totally whacked.

I am going to start logging EVERYTHING I do in missions and emailing them to funcom.  Maybe , hopefully they will get a clue

ps.  I AM implanted wayyyy above my level,  am solitus , use Nanos  wayyy above my level,  and have excellent AC,  HP and Nano pool due to the implants.  I am NOT  a noob,  been around since beta 4.  I KNOW how to play my charactor.   This is for the guys who will say its ME and not the game.

The last two times I have hunted I have used my L101 MA character to backup Doc's heals if things got too hot for the Doc to handle.  On two consecutive occasions now I have suddenly died for no reason, about 20 seconds after the monster has been killed.  it's not lag,, it's a new bug.  I take no damage from the monster.. I just suddenly die for no reason while I am standing there.  
Last night I lost 500K and tonight I lost 700K.  There is no point in petitioning about this,, I might as well shout at my goldfish as speak to a GM for all the good it will do.  What is the point in me doing direct heals if it gets me killed by a stupid moronic bug ?  I want my money back please.  
This game has been out for 6 months or so now, and it has more bugs today than it had when I played the beta version.  Funcom I really hate you now.  I hate you for spoiling my enjoyment by failing to resource this game in any way that is remotely worthy.
All you want is our money, and it's so obvious now that all you are doing now is firefighting on a sinking ship.

Bjond @ 11/28/2001 1:57:58 AM (1359):
All bug reports and bug e-mail to Funcom is completely ignored.  I posted countless bugs in beta and most of them are still in the game now.  I doubt they have test scripts.  From the quality of code, I doubt the coders even test their own changes and they probably don't have a QA group.  If they do have QA, the coders either never let their own QA know which areas they changed or they also ignore bug reports from their own QA.

Basically, if you find a bug, post it here for the other players, but Funcom won't do anything about it if you send it to them.

Err... the unfortunate thing is... there are lots of players like Notorian around who uber twinked their characters to be able to handle 100% missions.

Becoz of them.. Funcom had to tune up the difficulty level.... the result ? Those who don't twink will suffer.

Icaria, u will have to twink your character a bit... do what Notorian suggested... inplants, overequip, ask for some help from higher levels if u need to.

Also... there are some mobs who fight differently. No matter wat level they are, they hit extra fast. Examples of such mobs ?
Anuns, Lifebleeders, Probes, etc. (am sure there are others, that 34-v could be one of them?)

If u find missions with such mobs... and if your character can't handle them. Just delete the misson and don't waste your time on it.

It's quite unfortunate... especially if u had to run for a long time to get there only to find that u can't complete the mission. Sigh... but I can't think of way around it.

What is up with you Nororian???  This is the THIRD post I have read tonight, where you put down the poster!

Do you work for Funcom?  Or do you get a kick out of just flaming everyone with a comment that doesnt lean positively towards the game?

Skara @ 11/28/2001 6:58:18 AM (1954):
I have only had this happen when I was fighting a monster. Now when I see the symptoms, if I am fighting something I am not too worried about, I will sit it out, use a heal stim, and the combat turns out ok. If the combat is something that would be close anyway, I zone out of the mission.

I don't like it because I lose my map, but its better than dying, then having to travel back to the mission site to finish.

I rarely hunt outside, so if that is your thing, this won't work. But I have not died since I started zoning when I notice it is happening.

-> Hossley: Nice to hear about another interesting NPC. Due to the latest restriciton in Mission distance I don't visit Galway County lately. Maybe I check sometime.

Talking about abusive gameplay - Idiots never get extinct . Can you hear them: I am roleplayer, I am a great roleplayer, I kill everything just because I can, I don't need any reason for it. I am a Champion [ugh, ugh, ugh, scratching under the arms]!!! Brains like peas  (This attitude is faction independant).
So, in the end, Ross might have more than enough reasons to cancel  the amnesty ...?

Serious side note:
Welcome to neutral feelings my dear OT servants. Helplessly watching morons attacking neutral NPCs and guards just because they are bored without any chance to help them.

And these specialists from Funcom nerf sneak and other things because it is a too easy way to get money and xp ... .

So long,

Anyone who doesn't get Galway County as part of their Startup Map Pack, i.e Non-Omni, is in theory, deep inside enemy territory. After all, the Brontoburger factory is there! This doesn't help people who join Omni later on though, but I can see why Clans and Neutral players should have a hard time learning the Sekrit Details of our Burger Production facilities. 

A Broken Shores map would be very useful though.

Hello,

I thought the take it easy bug was fixed but seems it's not. Instead of zoning/log off, or using brawl, just target another team member, hit "q" (will say you can't attack team members), target mob and hit "q" again, and voila.

The main drawback, doesn't work when soloing... sorry.


Hope it helps,

Twink, what a funny term.


I was not aware that playing the game using the advantages  the  game designers implemented into the game was known as twinking.

If I ask for a buff from a friend, is that twinking?..much the same way you ask for an AC buff if your going to tank. Buffs are around, its not like I exploited to do any better, I just played the game with the advantages it has in it.

Everyone has equal oppurtunity to play the game the best that it should be, this isn't twinking, it's playing right.

Don't call me a twink because you won't ask for high buffs, or won't spend the time to make implants. I play this game for fun, and I use every thing I can to make my character good.

Notomni @ 11/28/2001 2:26:50 PM (1969):
Sigh...

Ok first of all, I don't spend alot of time on one character..I spend the most time on my soldier but I have a lvl48 NT, lvl12 Agent (freshman), lvl18 MA (freshman), and my soldier is a Rookie.

Secondly, my body dev plants work fine. Increasing body dev and the HP it directly effects.

Third, because I'm high leveled doesn't mean the games boring. The game is actually much more fun, having a plane, flying around looking at all the areas, having guild members who are the highest on the server and fight insane mobs with. The game is not as boring as sitting around at lvl 50 camping the bully bridge.

No, lilnano, I do not work for funcom. If someone posts a thread that I see is childish, am I not allowed to say that? Also, on those other threads where I allegedly flamed someone, I apologized for the misinterpretation of what I was trying to say. Thats 2, I'd like to know where the third is..

As far as your problem Cub, maybe be more specific like I first asked? Maybe tell us the quality level, or perhaps which type (faded, bright, shining). If you just say "body development implants don't work" and they do for other people, how is this helping your situation?

I'm sure FC would be glad to help if you would be more specific, please do because I do not want the Body Dev implants that I use  that work perfectly fine to be changed in any way.

muftak @ 11/28/2001 2:40:21 PM (2029):
Im sorry to say your wrong about MA's being crap at pvp with the latest changes i decided to check it out . 1st up i face a soilder 13 lvls above me he wanted a duel so i thought i hate PVping aganist soilders but wtf. Oh btw i agree getting rooted does suck but thats part of the game enforcers get the same problem so does all close comabt surrport.


So there i am 62 at the time facing a lvl 75 i completely destroyed him thanks to my heals which i only used one . In fact destroyed him 3 times on hte trott cuase he couldnt belive how he lost.

The way for MA's in PVP to go is BWT or MA weapons with BWT theres not many who you cant beat. With weapons Get a good fast pair like i have and you have an extra 2 attacks same dam as your fists.

As with MA's crap at PVM thats utter BS the only problem i have is with anun tearers.

Missions are great now i still get the odd full grey one but still i get 20k in rewards and about 10k in loot. But now some 50% missions are providng a great challenge did one the other night at 50% in agean about 30 mobs all orange 1 lvl above me Hardened mobs . Took about 1 hour to finish mission but it was fun.

Im sorry to say MA's with The right armor and the right specail or weapons are great now.Ma's in the 1st month or so before the MA love patch were utter tripe.

muftak @ 11/28/2001 2:42:24 PM (1543):
LOL thanks

Oh i agree with you btw there is no MA run buff apart from velocity.

Kinkstaah @ 11/28/2001 2:45:48 PM (IS Martial Arts and 2 hand weapons a bug? 2181):
IS it? IS it intended?

I for one would like to know. It would seem that a *2 hand* weapon couldnt be used with MA.. as well your hands would be busy holding it, wouldnt they?

Is it intended or not? Currently it works just like every other style of melee weapon (or ranged weapon for that matter) in terms of going with MA

IS THIS GOING TO CHANGE?

Before I potentially waste a lot of IP.
My personal hunch is that this MA "Dual weild" will be limited to weapons which have "Martial Arts" as a requirement.

So as such, I am tentative as to whether to blow lotsa IP 
Anyone know?
Might have to /petition about it to find out

Nivil @ 11/28/2001 2:48:32 PM (2181):
I don't see why it would go away. Look at your character. During recharge time he is holding it with one hand. He only uses both hands while actually swinging it. So I don't see any reason why he can't use MA just like someone who is using a 1h weapon. =)

Hunterdroid @ 11/28/2001 2:53:12 PM (SURPRISE!!!!!! ..not 2184):
And we haveto wait yet ANOTHER hour..why am I not surprised..

Nivil @ 11/28/2001 2:54:51 PM (MA + Weapon Bugs: Fix this year? 2185):
Since Funcom won't acknowledge they are even working on this problem (if they have, it must be buried so deep here that it's practically impossible to find), can you at Funcom at least give your ARKs some basic training? Being referred to a fix for a completely different problem that has NOTHING to do with the current problems with MA + weapons does in no way garner respect for ARKs. 

While zoning, debuffing, buffing, leveling...an MA (well, anyone who has over 120 ma I guess) who is wielding a weapon will find that his punches do not register at all. This can be worked around through the tedious method of removing weapons, buffing, wielding weapons, removing weapons before zoning, etc etc. It's a pain. Is it intentional? Is it a bug? Do MAs have any basis for complaining about it? 

Thanks

Silver @ 11/28/2001 3:04:30 PM (Cloaking device unequipable. 2189):
I play an agent and sometimes equip a cloaking device to get a bit more conceal if the mob can see me so I can get an aimshot off. This is what happens.

Equip cloaking device, go into sneak mode, select MOB, use aimshot (wont actualy go off untill the cloak is removed), remove cloaking device and take the aimshot.

Now when I used to do this it worked fine but now the cloaking device gets stuck on and i cant remove it untill i zone.

Btw I dont know if you should be able to take an aimshot useing the cloaking device in the firstplace.

Anyone else found this?

blu789 @ 11/28/2001 3:09:46 PM (2181):
The thing is, in actual practice (forget the idealisms and the philosophy), martial arts isn't all about hands.  It's about neutralizing an opponent, either through offensive maneuvers, avoidance, or turning his energy on him.

With that said, you have 2 feet free, one head free, lots of elbows and knees, and a whole bunch of teeth =).  I see no reason why you can't use martial arts with a sledgehammer, if you had training in such an unusual combination.

Not for long man..

The Blessed with Thunder special attack is bugged. First off, it's not 1/2'd like it should be in PvP, also it was supposed to be nerfed a few patches ago.

It was supposed to be a big hit, then a small DoT afterwards, and FunCom claimed to fix this but they didn't. The big hit does the same damage as the DoT, so it is exactly the same as it was.

Taebo @ 11/28/2001 4:06:06 PM (Mission selector graphics bug? 2210):
I noticed that when I use a Mission booth and set my sliders, I click on the mission button (I'm not sure of the name exactly), and then it goes gray, naturally. The text in the gray button now says "Generate Mission", but it didn't say that at first. It probably used to say that, but it says something else now, that I can't remember for the life of me.

Just a graphic bug.

Dudicas @ 11/28/2001 4:06:08 PM (976):
So umm, Cosmik ya think the drop rate on this stuff will be updated in this patch?  Sure would be nice to actually be able to complete a nanoprogram with all these hundreds of instruction disks I have.

Dudicas @ 11/28/2001 4:13:09 PM (2184):
An extra hour wait period, or have the servers up exactly when they said they hoped they would be and then have them crashing all day while the live team goes out for a beer expecting everything to be okay?  How about letting the servers come up on time but having to have a 24 hour rollback tomorrow because a hideous exploit was discovered, but they had to meet thier scheduled uptime?  Or maybe you would rather log in and have the server crash only to see that when you tried to log back in that all your characters had been deleted due to a bug that could have been prevented if only the servers had stayed down for another hour while it was tested out one last time?

Shut up and go do laundry or something.  Missing an hour of playtime is not going to kill you.  Defrag your hard drive, update your video bios, there's all kinds of things you could be doing besides whining that the servers had to stay down for an extra hour.

Dudicas @ 11/28/2001 4:15:31 PM (2210):
The mission generator has always greyed out "generate mission" until you change a slider after you pressed the generate button.  The only time it changes is when you click a mission and the red highlight goes around it, the generate button changes to "Accept Mission".

Dudicas @ 11/28/2001 4:17:51 PM (2181):
When I first heard about this, I asked the same question and got an email from Cz that stated while it may be reviewed in the future, that it is currently working as intended.  So nope, it's not a bug, perhaps an oversight, but it's not an exploit or anything like that.

My inventory screen STILL reorganizes itself 60% of the time when I zone. Um...didn't FC say this was fixed?

My Token board is stuck at 10. When I got 30 tokens(now I have more) it told me that I need to reach a new title to use it.

Wasn't this a Clan token board issue that was fixed? (I'm Omni)

And also, when I zone into a mission area about 30% of the time AO crashes on me (as of late) Any idea why?

Thanks in advance.

Misophist @ 11/28/2001 5:45:29 PM (Min damage against human NPCs 2240):
Well, after doing two missions, I can safely say that my MA is still doing minimum damage to certain human NPCs post patch. Doesn't matter what level they con to me. Back to bad/money/chaos missions, I guess.

Note: the mobs don't seem to be quite so difficult for some reason, but I'm still hitting them for minimum. Same mobs as before, no change, really. Maybe I'm hitting them a tiny bit harder, but it's still... 59, 59, 59, 59, 59, etc.

Anybody else notice this?

Rookie Clan Hunter: orange, 59, 59, 59, 59.
Rookie Clan Manhunter: yellow, 59, 59, 59.
Rookie Clan Soldier: yellow, 59, 59, 59.
Rookie Clan Engineer: orange, 59, 59, 59, 59.
Meta-Phys: 45, 45, 45, 44, 45.

Mobs I don't do min against:
MAs, Agents, and nano-techs.

LostLogic @ 11/28/2001 5:45:38 PM (Big Root NF bugs 2241):
1. Many times roots will give a success message but the creature will continue to run around normally.

2. If you cast a speed debuff on a creature, roots no longer work.

3. If you blind a creature and then root, it fails sometimes.

4. It seems that many debuffs on creatures will cause roots to fail.

LostLogic @ 11/28/2001 5:49:45 PM (Big Calm NF Bugs 2242):
1. Sometimes when you calm a creature it will immediately re-aggro you even though the calm succeeded.  If this happens once, it will happen from then on out with the particular creature.

2. Calmed creatures will follow you around like a pet.  You cannot get away from them.  When the calm wears off you are back in the same situation you tried to get out of since the creature is right next to you.

3. If you calm a creature and get in a jet, you cannot get out of the jet unless you zone.

4. If you calm a creature that has attacked you and you are standing somewhat close to it, you auto-attack and break the calm.  Please give us an option to turn off auto-attack...please please please please.

5. Casting calm on a "social" creature will cause all of its buddies to aggro you.  Hopefully this is a bug as it makes it very difficult to use calm effectively in missions.

Thanks.

Taebo @ 11/28/2001 6:30:59 PM (2210):
That's not entirely true.

The Generate mission is near the top of the window, and the accept mission is at the bottom, below the sliders.

So Generate is above sliders, accept is below.

It will be along time till they fix and if they do .

i can't see BWT to be on the nerf list as there will be alot alot of angry MA's out there.

I myself am not bothering with BwT as i dont really have parry trained and not wasting ip in it.

Besides the can't use this item bug for rechargers and treatment labs, has anyone else had this bug?

I do a mission fight off 3 yellows sit down to recharge nano and hp's and nothing, no you can't use this item nothing! I can't even loot the remians of the npc's I just killed! But I can use 1st aid!

The only 2 things I have found to fix this is to 

A: zone (which is anoying in a mission because your map disapears so you don't know where you have been)

B: start another fight with a npc (not to good of an idea because most of the time I don't have enough nano or hp's left over from past fight to finsish next fight)

This is a very anoyying bug

starknaked @ 11/28/2001 7:32:41 PM (Swimming bug and solution 2261):
I've reported this elsewhere, but might as well do so here too.

If you die while swimming, you will be ressurected still swimming on land.  And there will be no way to stand up again, zoning won't do it, terminating won't do it, /quitting won't do it.

The only way out is to slowly swim your way across the land to the nearest lake or other body of water.  Once you are swimming in the water, you'll be able to exit it and stand again.

Spetnov @ 11/28/2001 7:43:51 PM (Lost Rifles 2267):
This morning I logged on to equip some armor . I was unaware there was a patch today and was /afk frequently . 

I needed the 25 agi bonus of my Tsaka Rifle to equip my armor .I un-equipped my ql 200 Stigma I had traded with Superflu a few days earlier . Together with my QL 188 Ranee ( rare as hell ) I put them into a bag where I hold all rifles . 
I had cycled through the mission terminal for over three weeks to find a QL 188 Ranee as a reward , all the time staying at level 105 . Finally it popped up and with the help of Kuup I was able to find it in the mission cave . 

Now you can guess what happened . The server went down on me whilst I was getting coffee. 
I patched later today and when I logged on the rifles had dissapeared . I petitioned but they have a 0 reimbursement policy . 

Apart from the trouble getting the Ranee and getting it equipped ( 250k IP to shotgun) it's the policy that bothers me most . 
The GM didnt really listen but just told me to fill out a report and that was that . 

Well thats it then .

Maybe relogging would work or entering and leaving your vehicle.

Nianna @ 11/28/2001 7:57:58 PM (2240):
I'm not sure this is so much due to bugs as due to NPCs that cast AC buffs.

All those types you listed are Engineer, Adventurer, and Soldier profession NPCs I think, so they'll all have AC buffs and cast them on themselves.  At upper levels especially AC buffs may absorb 20-80 damage, which in addition to NPC's normal AC may put your MA attack at minimum damage.  Unfortunately Soldiers and Adventurers are already harder than most because the Soldiers have high damage compared to most (probably due to very high weapon skill, so you take more critical hits) and the Adventurers heal themselves.  I believe like players Soldier and Adventurer NPCs may also have higher hit points.

Scorus @ 11/28/2001 8:01:18 PM (13.2 bug: auto-attack when nanocasting 2273):
A new bug: whenever I cast an attack nano, it automatically launches me into a physical attack (i.e. as if I hit Q). This happens no matter what my a-d slider is on and before I am attacked by the monster, should I get my nano off first.

This was with my MP, but if this breaks charms, mezzes, etc. then this will really mess with crats. Again.

Scorus

Nianna @ 11/28/2001 8:08:37 PM (1973):
The backpacks all do the same thing, as does the book of knowledge.  I think its nice having several different designs to work with even if they aren't different.  If the small backpack was actually smaller it would cease to be useful for keeping equipment organized.  If they do that I want to see more additional large backpack designs so I'll have some sorting options.

cson @ 11/28/2001 8:14:30 PM (2240):
I still don't understand why they can't just bring the HPs of the MOBs down with what they normally should be. There is no "strategy" advantage that a human player has except to zone out or run away. 

Just give the soldier, bullies, etc MOBs normal HPs and not double.

Meetshield @ 11/28/2001 8:17:10 PM (2240):
Yeah, this bug is still there.

I just did a mission and there was a human npc (rookie enforcer) who had a million hps, was hitting me for man than I could heal and I was only doing minimum damage to.  I had to zone 8 times (no exageration either) to beat him.  Sorry but spending 25 minutes of fighting just to beat one mob is ridiculuous.

Biggest pvm problems I see.... minimum damage attacks against human npcs, and the fact that they have 3 billion hps.


/sigh

Taebo @ 11/28/2001 8:31:07 PM (2210):
Update...

Saw a screenshot...

The mission window says "Request Mission" above the sliders and "Accept Mission" below them.

When you click "Request Mission", it turns gray and says "Generate Mission"

Nelida @ 11/28/2001 8:56:05 PM (NOW missions are screwed... 2279):
I'm a level 65 Trader with a ql134 Vektor and...

1. With mission slider on center I get all oranges and yellow with a FEW greys and NO greens.
2. I could easily take out yellows BEFORE today. Now I get owned by GREY rollerrat queens!
3. Yellow and orange C27 Runaways are taking very little damage from me. It's like my damage was cut in half OR their AC was increased dramatically.

This is unacceptable...I can't solo a middle setting mission any more?

Furthermore, I'm sick and tired of camping mission terms passing up crap load after crap load of missions for clothing and implants (combination of clusters I couldn't possible use OR sell).

Well, I was doing min to a doctor, to a meta phys and several other NPCs that are not necessarily tanky types with damage shields. So you could be partly correct. However, this was not the case before 13.0, and quite frankly, it's unacceptable to be doing a constant and LOW minimum damage to mobs I have a hard time with normally. I'd say it's because they're orange mobs, but no, it's not just mobs that con higher than me. Yellows, greens, as well.

It was stated to be a problem with mob AC -- they actually had double the AC -- and was supposedly fixed with this patch. Unfortunately, I believe it's a 40+ problem, and the fact that it was not caught as a failed fix before going live is probably because it's mid-high level problem -- not many people bother levelling their characters on test. And it hasn't affected all professions, either. 

Anyway, I was talking to a level 97 fixer and several others who were having the same problem. This bug is horrible for that profession -- their HoTs can't keep up, and they don't even get the steady -- albeit pathetic -- minimum damage I manage to hit for with my MA. Blah. 

Bug or not, this is a problem.

starknaked @ 11/28/2001 9:08:41 PM (2261):
Nope, I tried entering and leaving my vehicle, that didn't help.

And, you can't relog, because you can't sit down, because you're swimming.  All you can do is /quit, and then when you come back on later, you'll still be swimming!

The only way out is to swim around the city or wherever you are, looking for water to swim into and back out of.

Zaal @ 11/28/2001 9:08:42 PM (1973):
Nianna - you miss my point.  The big backpacks aren't big enough.  They hold the same amount as the small back packs.

Make the big backpacks hold more stuff.

Zaal @ 11/28/2001 9:12:40 PM (2240):
Yes, its still a problem but it's not as bad as before. At least from what I've seen.  Then again I only ran three missions and ran into four whoel mobs that i couldnt hit higher than 3.  (And I had a +5 dmg mod buff running!!)

Dhurdahl @ 11/28/2001 9:13:29 PM (2242):
Good post!  

1) The mobs usually do an extra attack after the calm lands...aka the current attack isn't aborted.

2) This is VERY annoying and a terror in hunts with many mobs. when you are stressed it's almost imposible to see a) the calm land in the usual message spam. b) see it visually among the other debuffs. aka, they don't stop /follow.

3) lol... bug yepp will check

4) not a bug    (but I agree totaly. please decouple agg/def from cast time) and see nr5.

5) Thats a hard one.... does the initial NF hit count as an attack? If yes, then it's not a bug, if no, then it's a bug. I think it's related to nr1. The current attack isn't aborted.

Nianna @ 11/28/2001 11:42:40 PM (Container bugs still there 2299):
The container/inventory arrangement bugs are still there.

Observed Inventory Bugs

Rearranging the order of my bags in inventory mostly worked but sometimes after I zoned several times from Omni Trade to 20K they'd revert to the old order.  They stayed in the new order more often than not, but they should stay in the new order all the time.

Observed Container Bugs

Items still shift down in a bag after rearranging stuff.  I have several bags.  I move stuff around from bag to bag and grab all the items and put them at the top of every bag, then when I come back to the bag later after operating on several other bags my items in the bag are shifted down several lines.  I move them back up to the top, do several other things, then all of a sudden they are shifted down again.

Come on Funcom, you can do it!  Please make them work right.  Especially with all the trades starting to function it just is a real pain in the rear end to deal with these bags.  Otherwise make it so we can see the whole contents of a bag at once so I dont have to keep scrolling down to find out which bag I just opened.

Taldrin @ 11/28/2001 11:57:35 PM (Mission Chests! 2300):
Since logging on post 13.2 I cannot open ANY locked chests in a mission. I spent 5 minutes continually trying on the first chest I came to (at least 100 attempts). All chests that were locked I found had the same problem. Do they now require break & entry to be raised and this is just one of the many things you forgot to tell us in the patch log? Or is this yet another result of improper testing...

Xombie @ 11/29/2001 12:05:10 AM (2300):

I'm guessing that it would be a fix, since that is the only thing that breaking & entry is USED for...

I'll sure add my vote to that.  It's one of the things that is causing folks to lose faith as after being told several times "It's fixed!" when it isn't they kinda lose it.

Now, to REALLY make up for it all they could add a way to letter or number the backpacks so they are easier to deal with.  Or color them or . . . . .

My current skill is 43, it's at that level from what the abilities have raised it to (I'm ip strained enough without wasting ip on this skill). Pre-13.2 I could open any chest with only a few tries, now I can't open any of the locked chests! I don't get any requirements telling me I need so much skill to open this or anything. It's a shame because the unlocked ones are usually the empty ones too

Icaria @ 11/29/2001 12:38:57 AM (1960):
That in itself is a problem.  Any player should be able to go out on a mission or go out hunting without "a friend".  If I start relying to getting "a friend" to buff me up before I go, and that buff runs out at the wrong time . . . . . 

Been doing this since early August.  Used to go on missions alone or with a group and sometimes I died and sometimes I didn't.  But I did NOT have to pack a lunch to go on a mission as I do now. Used to do two or three at a time, can't do that now.  And guess what?  It was not I that did any of the changing that made it so difficult.

New patch is in.  First MOB was one step below me and I took it out in under ten minutes!  Think about it!

Of course, the fun part was when nature called and I curled my character up in a corner with no-one in the room and no-one outside the room in the immediate vicinity.  Came back maybe five minutes later JUST in time to see my character killed by a MOB shooting through the wall.  So now I have this number 10 tin can on the floor . . . . . . <ROFL>

I picked mid level missions, all close to terminal source, most have been deep yellow to orange mobs, few grey, and very lil green.  Also I seem to still be hitting for very minimal damage against the deep yellows and orange, then if I get in trouble and leave and heal and come back they are already healed up again.  Lost cause.

Sigfried @ 11/29/2001 1:22:13 AM (2306):
No just about everyone is.  Some using exotic weapon damage like chemical or shotguns that use the oft ignored duck exp arnt getting it as much.  Also heavily overequiped enforcers and the like arent getting hit by it quite as bad.

Basicly for some reason the damage craps out with MOBs around your level, especialy those that appear well armored in their animations, especialy those apparently wearing low-tech armor.

My engineer always does min damage against adventurer MOBs for some reason.  Even my lv 52 pet does min damage on yellow adventuers.  Since the pet has a high min damage it dosn't effect my class as badly, but without my pet their damage shields do more damage than my high level guns.

Greystar @ 11/29/2001 1:26:54 AM (2300):
This is really a great thing, now chest loot, pickup item and reward are the same QL. Of course chest locks are higher QL too then and you better raise your lockpick next level to get the good stuff

Does this mean because i'm level 46 is the reason why i'm doing minimum damage now?  And if that's the case I have lower level chars I "could" work on until this is remedied.  Does it affect them?

Loot is great.. at 50%, mobs are green and yellow.

Their HP regen had been fixed too. I could zone out and back in and they did recover.. but not as much as before.

BUT... I had not fought any NPCs... only monsters... so I can't tell if the AC bug is still there. But I do ok with monsters (and I'm only using some puny pistols)

This may be great for all the people with the green break and entry skill who can maybe afford the IP for it.  Odd how individual missions have locked doors and you are now forced to choose between being able to complete a mission and being able to raise the skills you need to be competitive.  Nice move make sure the NTs and MPs have more things they need to raise.

If you force people to raise a skill it should really be even across the board.   Since you can't finish most missions without at least opening one door,  your forcing people to spend IP when they are already strapped for IP.  Another great move glad the loot is good I doubt I will ever see any unless they decide to make it less than the dark blue skill I need to raise to open any chest.

Thanks a bunch, glad to see they thought this one out too...

I tried to post on this the other day, but for some reason I kept getting " you are not signed in" and a vicious loop developed.

But yes,many times. Zoning into PvP areas, I run away while equipping car, if attacked, I cannot remove car, heal or exit the game for a fixed, but substantial time.

I no longer have the energy you recapitulate my wonderful lost post but, in essense, having a car is too cumbersome.

I would like car usage to be like this:

Car in inventory- right click--on
Car in HUD- right click-off

Car rules were changed because they were used as get aways in Pvp. I think this solution is outweighed by the new problems it creates.

uhhhh it doesnt take *tons* of BE skill to open stuff...at a skill of mid 300s i open stuff in ql200 missions with ease. It takes very little IPs to get to 300 skill and i open stuff in ql200 missions with that. Hoping to never have to raise BE skill is fine, but dont expect to open chests, its your call whether u want to open stuff or not.

PS: im one of the most IP challenged classes in game, try to keep up with a fixer's nano skills and get back to me about how bad u have it with IPs

Brad, STL/MO @ 11/29/2001 5:13:21 AM (Welcome to "Nowhere"? 2333):
Either someone at Funcom has been watching way too many Twilight Zone episodes, or I just hit the weirdest bug I've seen yet. This is right up there with the "swimming on land" bug.

I was running south through downtown Tir from Fair Trade, when in the middle of the plaza I get the message "Changing areas, please wait." When I finished zoning, it said I was in Nowhere.

I seemed to be on a mostly-featureless flat plain, a giant square floating in orbit. Nobody responded on Vicinity chat, even with /shout. So it occurred to me that I've heard some pretty long distance messages on "Seeking team," and asked around there.

Fortunately, it turned out this had happened to someone else. Following his directions, I eventually found the city of Tir, northeast of my starting position. When I entered the south gate ...

I was just outside Tir, going the other way at the same gate.

Too weird.

Zierow @ 11/29/2001 5:13:23 AM (2240):
It seems to me that if the mobs are Light yellow and lower, my damage does fine.  But as soon as they are Mid Yellow and up, my damage goes to the crapper?  Does this sound about right?

There are missions that you swim to get into also and when you actually zone into the mission you are still in swim mode.  NOT GOOD.  And I ingame bugreported it.

The scan terminal in Newland City is now by the prison.  Straight out of the whompah from Athens and up the hill.  Randomness. (probably trying to reduce town lag by the mission terminals.)

I hereby dub this the "You can't move" bug.

Bailed out of a mission with 4 mobs casting Blizzard of Red Tape etc. on me.  Could not sit to heal, could not move or jump. /quit and /terminate just put me still immobile on respawn pad.  Run speed and inits are normal, no hostile programs running, movement keys appear to be still bound.  I can spin, cast nano's, but not move. Selecting someone and doing /follow give a "You can't move" message.  This continued for 20-30 mins.

Thanks to GM Lucien who broke me free. He teleported me to ARKland with no change.  He then cast a root on me and when it wore off (or he cancelled it) I could move again.

Coupled with the "fixed" mob difficulty levels, it's no wonder large parts of Rubi Ka are ghost towns.  Enough so that I wonder if even the best intentioned developers can afford to continue, and wether I should be paying them while they do so?

Can anyone test to see if the normal SF's work after zoning?

Garnock @ 11/29/2001 8:45:05 AM (2273):
As stated in many other threads Funcom made that happen on purpose.  This is NOT a bug to them  The reasoning for having this happen is in PvP (dreaded scenario for those of us who don't do it) you can nuke someone and they don't know who is doing it unless they see the animation.  Also, the nukes did not trigger an attack.  

So, instead of fixing this on the other side, IE, getting hit triggers you to attack, they "fixed" it on our end.  When you cast, you attack also.  So I guess Izgimmers Last Word goes right out the window, now they know as soon as you start casting it.

Wait a minute, to heck with Izgimmer's.  I have Unstable Hadron, and it takes 9 seconds.  I cast, they see attack while my spell is still charging, and they run up, beat the crap outta me or stay back and shoot me.  Either way, our entire Alpha strike (yeah right) has now gone out the window.

I don't care about PvP, I understand why they had to do something, but this really screws up PvM for my style of playing.  These attacks break roots and charms, and they have a horribly annoying habit of spinning me around and then I run the wrong way and grab a tons of guys just beating the stuffing out of me.

I put my agg/def down for a reason, I DO NOT want to attack at all.

This is a band-aid fix for a problem that should have been handled on the other end of it.

Greystar @ 11/29/2001 10:17:20 AM (2273):
In PvM it is the same thing, mobs see you are attacking as well when you start casting, so soloing mobs with powerful spells might not be working due to interruption. With my MP, my attack spells are all weak and short to cast, so it does work, but if a spell takes a few seconds...i dont know.

WGMelchior @ 11/29/2001 10:18:28 AM (2184):
Why don't they just add an extra hour before announcing the time, and then if they can, make people happy by putting up the servers early. If they can't, they still manage to meet the deadline.

Never promise something you know you can't keep.

Saw glimpes of the "underworld" then message pops up saying "changing zones" poof im in "no where" start flying around and figured out i was in tir....BUT get this start flying toward the nw tir op ..think funny theres no one here. My group was to meet me there, getting tells they were waiting for me. I though how odd. Fly around a bit more, not a soul in sight but i still get LFG messages and such. Well I said heck ill meet them at the borgs so I head North FROM Tir country, from the nw op. I hit the zone boarder "changing zones" then guess what happened.... I zoned into Tir Country just north of the NW op. Either im going crazy or someone slipped me some of those magic glowing blue mushrooms.

MORB @ 11/29/2001 11:29:56 AM (2300):
It doesn't requires so much break and entry... What I do usually, is that when I stumble on a chest that I can't open after a dozen of attempts, I raise break and entry by something like 5 points, and afterward the chest opens without problems.
And (before the patch, maybe it's more now), I had to do this like once every two weeks, so it's not really an IP sink...

MA fist damage is capped... it wont get any higher no matter what you do... how are we supposed to get better gear when our fists are only so effective?  And dont even mention the MA weapons since they are so broken right now its not even funny.

So please, mr L33t gamer, please explain to us how we can over-equip like your soldier? 
			
		
	
Haha, may I laugh? I'm an "over-equipped" agent and with my over-equipped armor and rifle I was *NOT* able to take down a MA 10 (!!!) Lvls *below* me.  Ok, maybe my fault because I played fair and fought 1 on 1 instead of rooting the guy and shooting him from a distance - guess next time I'll just have to do this.  My Doc uses MA to fight, and I love it. Whereas my agent has serious problems taking even one yellow MoB out, my Doc does it easily, even orange ones.  Me and a friend (him a *true* MA) are easily doing missions with orange mobs (red to him, as he is some levels below me). So tell me more about *under-powered* MAs.

13.2 bugs and issues 
Hi everyone. Unfortunately 13.2 has come through with some (albeit minor) side-effects. The Support Team and ARK have been working non-stop to your answer petitions and emails, and now I just wanted to give you all an update on the issues at hand. 

Fixes 
- If you find yourself swimming on land (and unable to stand up), swim into any body of water and then walk out. 
-If you find youself unable to move at all (say, if someone rooted you whilst you were zoning), execute a root nano on yourself or get someone to execute one on you. If neither of these are possible, please petition using the /petition command and a member of the Support Team will help you. 

Bugs 
-We are aware of the problem with locked chests in missions 
-We are aware of the visual mission timer bug 
-We are aware the container gremlins are still there (blast their furry hides!) 
-We are aware the "you have countered the nano program" has not been fixed. 

I hope this helps you out if you have been affected by any of these. If you have, then I apologise. These will be corrected as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your time in reading this, and have fun on Rubi-Ka.

Band-aid fixes is all FC does. Same thing was done with the 40m range cap. And a dozen other bugs and exploits. They just never seem to learn.

Not only that, but they even break what they previously fixed. After 13.0 you no longer lost your "extra" health when zoning. Now we do once more. In the 13.0 patchnote the fix wasn't mentioned. In this one it was stated as "fixed". I don't know whether to laugh or cry. They fix it without saying then break it when they say they'll fix it.

So we're gonna get a THIRD patch where they claim to have fixed the container gnomes? Check it out. It's already listed as "fixed" in two different patches so far. And the fact they also break stuff they *did* fix proves they do not have any structure on how to use their version control software.

I've said it before, I'll say it again, I'm available on a consultant basis to fix it for you. 


(I'm just amazed, honestly. After all this time they still haven't managed to make things right. They keep making the same mistakes every single week. It's totally and utterly pathetic)

Fleh @ 11/29/2001 1:58:30 PM (2279):
This patch broke something atleast...I did a 65% mission and encountered 3 Red mobs in the first room....not only that but i got 4.5k xp for one mob and 6.5k for another (same type) they were both red. Also i didn't see a single mob below yellow...in the whole mission. is this your solution for the game being to hard funcom?

Mascot @ 11/29/2001 1:58:39 PM (2184):
So far I haven't seen FC manage to keep their promised uptime *even once*. They really should just add another hour or 90 minutes to their estimate. After a dozen upgrades where they've failed to make it in time each and every try you'd imagine they'd start realizing they just ain't gonna make it ever.

Santse @ 11/29/2001 2:03:01 PM (943):
Now, AGAIN, upon zoning..my hp's drop by a whooping 300hp! That was fixed and is broken again w/last patch.

I and another Nano-Technician also experienced problems with Team Missions. No generation and no credits withdrawn. We didn't get to test this before 13.2 patch, though.

Maximilian @ 11/29/2001 3:07:21 PM (2338):
If I recall correctly, the team missions are still NOT implemented. The comment about NOT taking it in was in the very first versions of the 13.2 patch notes.

So long,

13.2 bugs and issues 
Hi everyone. Unfortunately 13.2 has come through with some (albeit minor) side-effects. The Support Team and ARK have been working non-stop to your answer petitions and emails, and now I just wanted to give you all an update on the issues at hand. 

Fixes 
- If you find yourself swimming on land (and unable to stand up), swim into any body of water and then walk out. 
-If you find youself unable to move at all (say, if someone rooted you whilst you were zoning), execute a root nano on yourself or get someone to execute one on you. If neither of these are possible, please petition using the /petition command and a member of the Support Team will help you. 

Bugs 
-We are aware of the problem with locked chests in missions 
-We are aware of the visual mission timer bug 
-We are aware the container gremlins are still there (blast their furry hides!) 
-We are aware the "you have countered the nano program" has not been fixed. 

I hope this helps you out if you have been affected by any of these. If you have, then I apologise. These will be corrected as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your time in reading this, and have fun on Rubi-Ka.

Damn i guess its back to newbie loot in chests,
damn i really liked getting useful stuff in them for once.

Maximilian @ 11/29/2001 3:16:47 PM (2299):
Yep, my container gnomes aren't completly eradicated as well. Especially 'Advanced' shops (only leaving them) still cause some minor deranging. It is only a few items, though, that change place (move to the top).

Rather unregularly it still happens, that the content of my backpacks within my inventory gets deranged. This happens especially in mission areas, but I don't have any datails .

But it is much better than before (13.0).

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.s. Nice movie Jersey

Scorus @ 11/29/2001 3:33:54 PM (Auto-attack NOT listed as a bug! 2390):
All,

Check out Cosmik's message on the Funcom Talks About forum. He lists the bugs that were accidentally introduced in 13.2. He does not list the fact that auto-attack now goes off as soon as you cast an attack nano (including roots, charms, mezzes and others which are broken if you subsequently attack the target, which you now automatically do).

Perhaps he forgot to mention it despite the fact that there have been over a dozen threads on here complaining about it, but I'm guessing that this means it is not a bug but a 'new feature' that didn't get listed in the patch notes, again. Or, in Funcom parlance, 'attack nanos were always supposed to work like that and we fixed a bug in 13.2 that was preventing the auto-attack from engaging.'

Scorus

You do have a point, but your B&E is green it wil cost 100k IP to get to 300 for an NT

Team Mission terminals had been wroking in a few zones, such as broken shores via whompa from Trade.  I noticed last night that the terminal stopped working - would get an empty missin window and that was it.

Scorus @ 11/29/2001 4:08:02 PM (Cz, Cosmik, PLEASE answer: 2400):
Guys, I'm begging you. Please answer. Show you have a little respect for your customers.

1) Is the auto-attack after casting an attack nano a bug or a feature? I had read somewhere that you said it was the latter but can't find it in the many, many threads asking about it. If it is the latter, why wasn't it in the patch notes? How do you expect roots, charm, mezz, etc. to work?

2) You have pledged over and over that you will stop introducing new features that are not in the patch notes, yet you continue to do it. This prevents us from knowing what is a bug and what is a feature and causes massive confusion.

3) Will players ever be allowed to enroll in the official clans (Knights, Sentinels, etc.) and Omni departments?

Scorus

JerseyBoy20 @ 11/29/2001 4:16:45 PM (2300):
This whole thing could be great.
Ran 3 missions last night, had no problems opening chests, my problems came more in the form of annoyance after.

Who in their right mind locks a chest with NOTHING in it?
Is the the MOB in the next room snickering as I open it, then yelling "Fooled You!" before he comes in to blast me?

So Chests - Good
Locked Chests - Good
Hard to Open Locked Chests - Very Good
EMPTY Hard to Open Locked Chests - You've GOT to be kidding...

Takir @ 11/29/2001 4:35:41 PM (Scooplets/Diglets etc. Bug 2405):
Scooplets, Diglets, and all those other whateverLETS have a couple of bugs in missions.

1) you can't target them using the Tab key.

2) They never give any experience no matter what color they are.  Not even 1xp ^_^

Is this intentional or is it a bug?

Taelyn @ 11/29/2001 4:40:44 PM (1954):
I was instakilled for the first time yesterday.  I had a damage shield on, and I did get the warning, with the damage shield saying its usual message.  My question is, ok, I know I'm taking damage, what can I do about it?  I was too far from a zone edge to zone.  I can heal myself I suppose, but how long will I keep taking damage?

Another note, has anyone else had a bug where they continue to attack monsters -after- they're dead?  My guy keeps hitting them and I keep getting damage messages.  Its kinda creepy and annoying because I can't get the xp or loot until after I stop attacking.

Garnock @ 11/29/2001 4:40:48 PM (2390):
Scorus,

They did this to fix the PvP, where you could nuke someone with impunity and they didn't return fire unless they manually attacked you.

Of course, NO thought as to how this would COMPLETELY SCREW UP PvM.  (whew, I feel better now)

There ya go.

Taelyn @ 11/29/2001 4:45:14 PM (Two problems noted in 13.2 2406):
1)  The individual mission terminals at harry's in lush fields (the two that are near the two basic shops) still only give you two missions if set on full bad, full money, full easy.

2)  Since the patch, I have been getting booted every hour or two, far far more frequently than before.  And even worse, when I get booted, the game crashes my internet link (when I went to the Task Manager and told it to "end task" on my connection, it gave me the message that it wasn't responding).  Please fix this, this bug killed me twice and disconnected me right after finally finding a group last night.

bumpity..

Taelyn @ 11/29/2001 4:48:19 PM (2306):
The minimum damage bug affects everyone equally.  At level 51, I have a L53 peasant executioner (relatively quick, lower damage weapon) and a L66 rider executioner (slow and powerful).  The rider simply destroys NPCs.  The peasant executioner does minimum damage on almost every hit.  The problem is not with MA's, its with every weapon that attacks quickly.  Because MA's attack very fast, they're hit by high ACs the hardest.  Anyone else that uses light weapons, however, is going to have similar experiences.

So they say the current state of chests is not as it should be?  At least its better than it once was.  It'll be nice to those with green B+E to actually be able to use it for something.  And think....someone might actually want to team with a fixer!  Whoo hoo!

Doctorkain @ 11/29/2001 4:54:07 PM (2405):
They're Omni-aligned, and because you're Omni you have to target them on your 'friendly' spectrum (so friendly they'll punch your lights out!), which is ctrl-tab. You'll get no xp for killing them, and they're 100% a waste of your time. Thankfully they made them actually drop loot now at least.

Put a disclaimer if you have to.  "Whining and crying will not convince us to change this next thing, so get used to it."

Amen and Amen to the comments on EMPTY locked chests... ugh - come on Enno. Why bother putting a chest in a mission/dungeon if its only gonna be empty! It is unlikely that this is on purpose...but in the event that it is:

I normally don't grump about much in AO (I understand that it is an evolving work), but it's just silly to put empty chests in there. They serve no purpose, save that of burning up time on useless efforts (not to mention our buffs are typically running - and every minute costs us in the form of nanochargers). And now they (accidentally) get the bulletproof lock system that even Arnold Schwarzenager can't break open. Ah, but if you do get one of these nightmare-locked chests opened - surprise! It's full of... NOTHING... air... ya, that's right... you just spent 5-15 minutes of frantic left-click/right-click on an empty, locked, pure waste of time. Wasn't that fun?? /

Enno - here is an honest, well-intentioned, simple suggestion from an avid AO player for the randomly generated chests that are placed in each mission:

1. Put chests in the missions only when they contain something.
2. Do not put locked, empty chests in the missions, please.
3. Lock the chests that contain any kind of special loot item. The better the loot, the harder the lock is to pick (that would give incentive to use the B/E skill).
4. Do not put locked, empty chests in the missions, please.
5. Do not lock chests that contain common items (ammo, nano kits, etc.) - I'm speaking for myself here: I usually do not bother picking up ammo or easy-to-obtain loot of any kind.
6. Do not put locked, empty chests in the missions, please.
7. Concession: If you still feel the need to randomly put empty chests in the missions, then they need to be the unlocked ones, so we can quickly open/close and get on with our task.
8. Do not put locked, empty chests in the missions, please.

Really, this has to be one of the only issues/bugs/designs in the game that has become more of a nuisance than an enhancement, IMHO.

Hoping you will consider these thoughts.

Supposedly vehicles wouldn't unequip any more after you zone, but they still do.

Emmily @ 11/29/2001 5:18:52 PM (2242):
Got a response yesterday when I petitioned about the Distracts not working properly.

1)  Mobs get 2 saves vs your calm.  One save, which will give you the normal 'Nanoprogram executed sucessfully' message.  The other save is silent and you will only know if the mob continues to attack more than once or twice.  Virulent Minibulls and Enforcer type mobs are the worst so far to save the second time.

2)  Havent seen this one too much, but they do continue to follow visually for a while.  The server has them in the place you initially calmed them, and they will tp back there when the server updates sometimes.

3)  Just found my Jet yesterday, so I don't know about this one yet (Yipee!)

4)  Bugs the hell out of me too, I just hit Q as soon as I get the 'You have attacted...' message.  That way I don't attack.

5)  Supposed to work that way.  Calms are agressive programs.  If they work the creature charmed wont attack, but all of his pals will beat the *&^% out of you. 

Hope that helps some.

zeroframerate @ 11/29/2001 5:21:02 PM (2370):
I've found that if you change the graphical settings and then exit the game to the Login, it won't save the changes.

But if you exit the game to Windows and let the client task fully end and then relaunch the game, the graphic settings will then be changed.

Give that a try first and see if it works. Otherwise we can just go ahead and modify the .CFG files manually.

Laeni @ 11/29/2001 5:25:04 PM (1954):
Now when I am fighting something and it doesn't appear to be damaging me when I know darn well it should be...I start casting heals on myself. Usually the first heal cast will cause my health bar to reveal the real story.

It's still a pain though because in close fights I time the heals, the first aid kits and the nano kits so I don't run out of all three at the same time and without a reliable health bar this gets real tricky.

Emmily @ 11/29/2001 5:29:56 PM (2279):
My mission distances have gotten shorter => less reward.

The new loot is very kool.

Some mobs are still taking far less damage (Soldier/Enf/some agents).  I mean 250 less damage on crits, and lots of min hits.  Sorry guys, your fix for human mobs didnt work.  

Still viable, and thanks for the Yamaha I found in the first mission I played after the patch!

Um, at level 40 I was using a QL88 shotgun with selfbuffs and QL50 implants only.  I built the implants myself and put them in using only selfbuffs.  I took hours to design and build them (try finding all the NCs you need, that takes forever).  Are you saying I shouldn't be able to use my shotgun because you are too lazy to do the same?  Are you calling me an Exploiter?  Do not defame my name.  

I spend more time than you working on my character.  I am not racing to level 200.  I am tired of all the people who are unwilling to put in the time to craft (yes craft, it takes time, thought, and a plan to make a good character) their character shouting 'Nerf'.   If you wont make the effort to make an exceptional character, then live with a so-so one.  Period.  I think that Funcom is wrong to try and ballance the game for the weak players, but that is not my fault.  

I wear and use all of my equipment with only my own buffs, and use equipment 10-45 levels above me.  That is how my class is designed.  Dont try and limit me by your own rules.

Takir @ 11/29/2001 6:02:22 PM (2405):
That makes no sense.

If they are Omni-aligned and I am Omni-aligned then why do they attack me?

If they didn't attack me I wouldn't bother to fight them.  If they do attack and I am forced to fight, the Tab key should work and I should get experience.

There is no logic here.

It is a bug.

I don't really care how it is fixed.  Either have them not instigate the aggression, or allow me to target as enemy and get experience.  It just needs to be fixed.

Well, sort of. I do notice that I hit lower level mobs a bit harder than some higher, but it seems totally dependent on the class of the mob. For instance, I'll hit a green adventurer or soldier or enforcer mob for 59 constant damage, augmented by low brawls and my DoT Blessed with Thunder, but I'll do the same thing to an orange MOB of the same profession. I do fine against spies, assassins, nano-techs, etc., as well as MOB MAs, no matter what level they are. Meta Phys MOBs -- green, yellow or orange -- seem to yield some strange and low numbers, though. Which seems odd.

Last night, I went on some missions with an engineer, and I was doing 73 minimum damage because he gave me a "sympathetic arms enhancement". But I was still doing minimum damage.

And off topic, sort of -- there was a high level 'crat mob type in the mission, deep red to me, that I did minimum damage to (of course) and also resisted my Blessed with Thunder CONSTANTLY. In fact, it resisted my Bird of Prey, which is QL125 (this mob was level 90ish) as well.  I could NOT attack this mob with my special. Really annoying.

Anyway, seems that min damage is connected to the level of the mob, in some cases, and definitely a problem with the mob's profession, AC and perhaps damage shields, though not in all cases. I don't know what's going on, really, but I'd love to see it fixed.

Also, I don't really think this problem is terribly noticable until after level 40, perhaps after skill caps. At least for the martial artist profession.

Misophist @ 11/29/2001 6:37:23 PM (2410):
My plane unequips while zoning. But a friend pointed out that since it's 60% sense, and I have one sense implant in, I probably don't meet the playshift requirements on the vehicle. However, the plane I use requires 89 air vehicle, and I have 98. I don't really know my base skills, but I think that one sense implant wouldn't affect air vehicle *that* much? I do max sense, but gah. Annoying.

Some people report that they can zone with their plane. I can't.

We should for an org, try to get people to believe us. We'd be like UFO abductees in the 20th century, or something. Our characters could get all paranoid, become the ultimate conspiracy theorists, start digging into other cover-ups -- and then, being paranoid crazies, try to prove that they're all related to this alternate dimension. Could be fun, no?

IRL, I suspect that this happens when you cross a zone or area boundary and the server screws up and can't figure out where to put you. This morning when I woke up, it occurred to me that I appeared at the southwest corner of the square -- coordinates zero by zero, by definition.

1. I have done 2 missions in VW the past couple days and both times for some odd reason my run speed would tripple! Just out of the blue, no specific time but when I zone out it is back to normal.

2. The mirror door effect is still really bad in missions!

3. I seem to see people "swimming" in the GROUND around the VW OP and Tir

4. My Team Speed buff won't buff anybody but myself (this is new)

5. Tried to cast reet on a traded last night and it went through the motions but would not turn her into a bird!

6. There are no QL 50's and 60's Rider Exicutioners (anykind) showing up in the machines as often as other things. I have been looking for 4 days now! That includes constently running from advanced store to the other advanced store in Athen for about an hour.

Playing last night Sparrow Flight Other no longer works.  When someone in my team cast it on me, I saw "Nanoprogram executed successfully" and saw the animation around my character, but I didn't turn into a reet, nothing showed up in my NCU, and my run speed wasn't affected.

The night before last it worked fine.  (Well, as fine as it worked then, with the dropping after zoning).

This is quite annoying.  I had forgotten how frustrating life was before reet form.  (There were lots of bitter jokes about "Jogging Online" last night).

Also, our ADV has a "Team Terrain Knowledge" that has doesn't actually work to buff the team, it just buffs her.  Not sure if that's a reported problem or not.

Thanks for reading.

"Nowhere" is the background outside of city playfields. they stick the surrounding zone out there simply for the sake of atmosphere, without the rocks and mountains and stuff. I think it's a mapping glitch or something. but just find a zone line and hit it, you should end up in a real playfield.

Tiran @ 11/29/2001 7:37:51 PM (2405):
They used to not aggro on you.  This was 'fixed' because it meant you could 'run' a mission for the rewards with no, or very minimal, opposition.

They should, of course, have made them give experience, though, if you're going to have to fight them.  Obviously, they're 'rogue' droids, or they wouldn't attack, right?

Nazu @ 11/29/2001 7:45:02 PM (2405):
They've always aggro'd on me since this bug was first introduced. Could just be my bad luck.

Here's a tip.

Try always setting your Order/Chaos slider on Order. This should give you almost all humanoid mobs. Works for me anyways.

Mustafo @ 11/29/2001 7:52:19 PM (943):
A couple things I saw.

1) double strikes.  Creatures are hitting twice in what appears to be one attack

2) MOB inits way out of norm outside or if you zone and then zone back

3) Auto attack on any Nano run on a MOB

4) MOBs still regenerate at a pretty good pace

5) MOB Con still ranges from grey to orange in even level missions.  (this is not consistent and some seem to work fine and others not)

6) Vehicles still check for skill before implants on zoning.  Cars drop off if you don't have the base skill to use it.

7) attack and nano bars stop or become out of sync with actual value.  Usually happens if you are doing both(see #3) 

8)  getting agro from much farther away especially in missions. 

9) of course stuff still moving in backpacks





I think this is a very stable patch in comparison to the last one.  Still a few issues

And while you are at it maybe you could find those scroll bar gnomes in the shops too.  They just stop working sometimes (very frequently) while scrolling around.  In order to get them to work again I have to open another pane above the shop or close a pane to get the shop window to shift position in order to get the bars to scroll.

Takir @ 11/29/2001 8:05:22 PM (2414):
I know and have experienced the run speed bug in missions.

The conditions that genrate it are, at the least, interesting.

It seems to be the last in a chain of strange events.

1) two or more Human NPCs team up on you and start casting Nano-Net (I have had it with others but mostly nano-net).  As they chain cast, rather than overwriting the one running in your NCU, another one appears.  I have had as many as four of these on me at one time.

2) as they begin to wear off, something weird begins to happen in the computation of your run speed until you end up with very high run speed (I had 1666 run speed one time and could barely navigate through the mission).

After observation, I think the following happens.  Assume you have 100 run speed and the debuff is for -200 run speed.  As the same spell gets stacked on you, the math should be:

+100
-200
-200
-200
-200
--------
-700

Somewhere, some code "knows" those should not stack so you only ever get to -100 run speed (like this):

+100
-200 = -100
-200 = -300 but limited to -100
-200 = -500 but limited to -100
-200 = -700 but limited to -100

NOW they start to wear off.  As they do, there is no code that "knows" those were multiples of the same buff Soooo it goes like this:

-100
+200 = +100
+200 = +300
+200 = +500
+200 = +700

Thus, you now have +700 run speed and NOW your base is at +700 so if this all happens again you will have +1400 run speed

Xente @ 11/29/2001 8:25:24 PM (Quantum Wings *not* fixed 2431):
Quantum Wings does not work properly after you zone, its impossible to take off.  After zoning twce, you're back to walking.

Its mildly irritating that it doesn't work - its extremely irritating that it was placed as a "fix" when it took about 10 seconds of testing to verify that it wasn't fixed

Fekal @ 11/29/2001 8:32:43 PM (2414):
I would 'nt call it a bug, it's more like a bonus.
FC finaly found out how boring this game has become, so they added this little treat to amuse us.

Dont think every body like's it tough, but ones I tried it I want to do it over and over again.

Guess I'm a speed addict.........

Virulent Minibulls and Enforcer type mobs are the worst so far to save the second time.

			
		
	
2 saves?  Hmmm...I really wish they would change that part, or at least change the success message. 

I am level 104 (yes, no levels in a while) and tons of things resist nanos now more than before.  It also seems like calm almost completely does not work on high level stuff.

I cant beleive you &*&*#@@@ havent fixed the minimum damage bug on missions yet. Its been freaking WEEKS!!!!!

I cant do missions because i cant do any more than 7hp damage!!!

I do 60-90 hp damage on everything outside of missions, but as soon as i go on a mission and encoutner human MOB i only do 7hp damage...Im lvl 39 Enforcer.

Ive petitioned, ive done everything. Now im broke, cant upgrade my gear to hunt in better areas and all the old hunting grounds are grey. Nothing fun about funcom.

All my mezz nanos are effectivly useless now. When I start to cast I go into auto-attack, which of course makes the mob attack me.

The point of the mezz line is to prevent combat..

Have you tried just clicking on the down-arrow to the side of the list (scroll like the old way)? That works for me. It seems there's a problem with the way the client figures out how to display a large list of items as it seems: if you try it yourself, you'll find that after clicking the down arrow a few times on the shop window you'll get to a point where the items won't scroll up one line right away. You have to click it twice just to bypass one line of items (and the items will advance two lines just that one time). It's at that point that the wheel scroll gets caught and can't progress further.

Just another bug.

Scorus @ 11/29/2001 10:10:23 PM (2390):
There is another thread now with an email from Funcom that it is a bug. So now we have some people saying that Funcom has said it is a bug and some people saying that Funcom has said that it isn't. 

Didn't someone mention something about better communication with players? In fact, didn't they say that a good 6 or 7 times so far?

Sigfried @ 11/29/2001 10:17:03 PM (2306):
When min damage take effect.  I'm not sure when it comes into play, sometime arround lv 30 I think.  I've got a lower level character and havn't run into the min damage problem against the same kind of mobs that stymy my 42nd level character.

It also seems to be that the armor needs to be at a certain level, its like you hit normal to a point and them nothing but minimum after that.  Not much in between.

I'm not sure what the combat formula is but I don't care for it much.

I dont think the AC on mobs has changed, but I think they changed the combat formulas in some way (probably as part of the attempt to fix PVP) and it relustled in armor being more effective at nearly equal ratios.  So if your armor is junk it dosn't do much, but if its comperable to the attack of characters your level then it has a big impact on damage.

I've noticed that most mobs hit me for min damage most of the time now as well, but since their min damage is so high I don't think allot of people have noticed this yet.  The ones that don't are usualy using unusual damage types like chem or the poison.

You can tell when you hit min damage because all the hits do the same give or take a point.

Hodaka @ 11/29/2001 11:06:09 PM (phantom rifle firing 2446):
I assume this is a bug.  Two things now happen when fighting mobs and shooting them with my rifle.

1)  The rifle almost always fires twice, one is always a phantom shot and doesn't seem to even use ammo.  Definitely no damage.
That one has existed a while.

2)  Suddenly my rifle will start firing fast over and over and over again, but it's another phantom shot.  The problem with this is, I'm getting shot several times in a row by the Mob I'm attacking, and I've even died from this.  After several shots, suddenly one real shot will fire and the effect goes away until the next time it decides to rear it's ugly head..

Both of these waste valuable fight time and could cost a character their life, but the second is really deadly because it's a prolonged amount of time where you're not doing a single drop of damage and the mob is pounding the snot out of you..

I died needing 1k of experience to level in a mission last night to a "gray" because of this bug

Coldstrike @ 11/29/2001 11:11:31 PM (1233):
It's a chest armor that is named a "Cloak".. Live with it.. Put a nano cloak in the back slot or whatever.

Coldstrike @ 11/29/2001 11:14:16 PM (1227):
Yup. Very annoying bug/feature indeed. They should also make it so that *any* version of the MK shield counts as a "higher quality" than every other reflect shield in the game. It blows when I can't cast the MK shield because I got some 15% reflect running that won't auto-terminate to let the Mk shield run.

Is there any work around to fix this.  I have exactly the air vehicle skill required to equip a plane.  However when I zone it always unequips.  I don't have any air vehicle implants at all.  Died yesterday being killed from mob after zoning because of this.  Can anyone help me understand why plane in unequiping.  Only thing I can think of is perhaps one of the abilities that air vehicle is based on is lowered during zone temporarily thus reducing air vehicle by one.  For instance if ability is boosted by an implant.

Subtile @ 11/30/2001 3:39:07 AM (2390):
Below comes my complaint that I've submited today:

For last two days I'm reporting a bug which made the game 100% unplayable for me. After the 13.2 patch, dropping the gun does not enable the melee attacks. To reproduce: Attack NPC with the gun / burst. Drop the gun. Try to do *anything*.
I guess you're making some attempts to 'fix' the situation, because sometimes (rare) the game allows both melee and projectile attacks to be used by the player at the same time (which is also wrong, of course). 

Unfortunately, most of the time it is impossible to do anything after using the gun attacks. The bug is very obvious and can be reproduced easily. I have reported it several times (other people did reported this bug as well), but I don't see this terrible bug mentioned anywhere on your website as an officially recognized bug. ( Even I've reported it *several times* yesterday, with /petition )

starknaked @ 11/30/2001 3:41:36 AM (2446):
Ok, I don't think you're actually losing anything because of this.

Basically, the animation that you see when you see your character firing and hear the gun firing, this has nothing to do with the actual firing that takes place.

The text that you see in the chat window which tells you when damage has been done is a much more accurate representation of what's going on in the fight.

That rapid firing that goes on now happens while your gun is reloading, so that's why you do no damage when that is happening.

Hodaka @ 11/30/2001 4:01:52 AM (2446):
Maybe I'm just hallucinating,but it sure seemed to take *A LOT* longer than my normal reload time.  I didn't time it however, I just died..

I had it happen today, and took someone's suggestion to move around.  I jumped in the air and my normal shot then hit the mob and i kept firing normally again.  I did this everytime it happened and it seemed to significantly cut down the amount of phantom firing that went on..

Guess for accuracy I should dig out my stopwatch to time it.. these are all just perceived times..

The last 2 missions I have done ,with the slider in the middle,
yielded great loot. but the mission was all grey except for 2 greens on the first mission and one (the npc I was supposed to kill) in the second.
I dont know. sure seems like the patch made missions worse instead of better to me. Even though missions arent really my primary source of exp, I'd still like to get SOME exp.

Scorus @ 11/30/2001 5:44:36 AM (943):
Tab targetting in missions has been much harder in the last couple of patches. I can hardly ever tab target through a doorway anymore. I can site target if I can see them but that isn't good enough for a pet user. We have to be able to send our pets in ahead of us and that is only possible if we target and /pet attack. We can /pet hunt but the results are usually disastrous, they will often head two rooms away and draw in multiple monsters or run off after more as soon as they finish with the first.

Zierow @ 11/30/2001 8:51:39 AM (I didn't know how bad NPC's were in missions until today. 2475):
For awhile all the mission terminal would give me was missions for humanoid NPC's.   I'm a level 46 MA.   When fighting the Humanoid NPCs as long as they were light yellow and lower I did decent damage, anywhere from 49 to 90.  If I fought ANY NPC humanoids that were deep yellow to orange I only hit for 49 to 52.  Today was the first mission that I have gotten just for creature NPC's and even when I fought the ones that were mid orange *in a 50% mission btw*  I was doing around 69 to 108 in damage.  That means when I fight NPC humanoids that are light orange my damage is almost halved as opposed to fighting NPC critters.   That hurts.   If they decide to keep it this way I wonder if they could put another slider on that mission bar that would help you stay away from NPC humanoids.  Then again, i'm not 100% familiar with all the functions of the sliders on the missions, so if there is one that controls that, please lemme know, I'd really appreciate it.

Zaal @ 11/30/2001 9:20:57 AM (Annoyed with auto attack 2480):
I feel that if NT's can attack themselves (which they still can) then they shouldn't be put into aggro mode against a mob with their casting of hostile damage programs.  UNLESS it's made so that they can't cast these nanoprograms against themselves.  Self annihilation is TOO easy as an NT.  And this auto attack cr@p forces us into new territory.  Are we SUPPOSED to be tanks now too?  If the mob is ignoring me because I'm not also hitting him with a rock that's not my fault - don't MAKE me use my weapon too.  I DONT WANT to.

End rant.

Remove this auto attack cr@p please.

Over equiping is cheating! The buffs are made with a time limmit! And what is I time limit? Oh, thats something that tells you how mutch time you have left to do something! And someone said "Everyone can over eqip".... NO! Casters have cant over equip! When you fier a nano it allways checks if you have high enough skills. Are you aware how anyoing it is to be slaughtereb by a lvl 10 when I my self is lvl 44? If, by some fu*ked reason, FC desides to make over eq. a part of the game, they have to change nanos so they dont check for skill lvl everytim they get started upp and they have to be faster!
And think of this... If NT were able to over eq. we could do thousends of damage at lvl 10! Would that be fair to you other profs? No it wouldnt! Thats why over eq. is cheating! Its realy unfair and the game isnt ment to be that way! You shouldnt be able to equip anything that is higher lvld than you! Now that I think about it I would like to be able to over eq. as a NT... I could probobly nuke a lvl 140 with my lvl 44 NT if I wanted to!
Let me say this again... Over eq. was nmot intended by FC, therefor it is an expliot, bug and/or cheating! and again... its not meant to be part of the game therefor cheating, bug and exploiting! And if you cheat you shouldnt be able to play! Noone likes cheaters! I hope you guys at FunCom read this!

This happens when your gun is empty. My guess is that your character is pulling the trigger rapidly and doesn't realize until a few seconds later that it's empty

Toser Ban @ 11/30/2001 11:55:39 AM (2438):
Well, I must say although it's quite annoying, it's not really a show stopper for me. I use my mezz nanos as effectively as before, and I use them frequently! You have to get used to pressing "Q" immediately after you start running the program. That works every time for me til now. 

Sometimes it looks as if the mezz'ed mob continues to attack, but thats mostly only one shot (or nano cast) which it probably started before the mezz was landed successfully. So nothing to worry, if you have your agg-def slider that you don't auto-attack when attacked!  

Anyway, I hope FC takes this new "feature" back soon.

What hurts me much more are the non-functional charm-lines of nanos. I was used to charm a mob and use it as an additional pet against other mobs (and that's what they are for, aren't they?). Now that doesn't work anymore (since 12.6 already, me thinks) and makes charms really useless! Even more now, when the duration has been increased - although a good change, you now end with a mob following you around for quite some time but not fighting for you, until the charm wears off and it starts fighting YOU immediately. And you don't want to sit in front of that mob waiting until it wears off to start fighting it again, do you?

Calox @ 11/30/2001 12:16:31 PM (943):
3) Auto attack on any Nano run on a MOB ?!?

so all you casters think nuking someone for 1k is not an attack ?
all you have to do now is overthink your strategy again, imho
e.g. drop you damn pistol, equip a lower melee weapon with 2m range ... or sit back and hug your pillow   (ok i dont play a nt or something, but i did in beta and remeber that i could nuke some monsters while standing right next to them without getting aggroed, i think you want this again ?)

Toser Ban @ 11/30/2001 12:18:05 PM (943):
That has just happened to me (an hour ago):

I was doing a mission in Lush fields, fighting an orange mob (a soft nanoharder). Well, battle didn't run too well and I had to run. When I was 3 rooms away I noticed that the mob hast turned back on my pet. So I sat down and healed and ran back to help my pet, when I noticed the message that my pet has killed the mob already.

Good, I thought, but then I couldn't find my pet anymore! It was still answering on /pet report and the coords said, it's right next to me. But there was nothing (scary somehow ). "Ok", I thought, "it's probably in one of the walls" (as we all know that this stuck-in-the-wall bug still exists ) and moved to the "main" mission room. But still my pet didn't appear and the coords still said it's next to me. And I couldn't target it either.

Next test was what's going to happen when I sent it on attack? Well, it did attack! It said "charge" and reports that it's fighting the mob, but there was no message that the mob is attacking my pet nor any message about dealt damage nor any change in health of the mob.
But when I used a DD nano on the mob itshealth bar immediately dropped down to one quarter (much more than the damage my DD has inflicted), so my pet was indeed hitting it! Btw: doesn't that sound familar to people experiencing the insta-death problem? 

I tried it again with some other mobs and got the same results.
In one situation I was attacked by the mob (who I thought was dealing with my pet), but no message indicated this. Again I sent a DD nano on it, and this time my health dropped half as well. In the same moment I got about 10 messages in the chat window that the mob has hit me for xx damage (again: insta-death problem).

Was the first time that ever happened to me, and I haven't heard it before.

But ofcourse it is!!! noone has said anything else. We are more then happy that the mob aggro on us when we hit them with a NF.

-> Toser Ban: First time I am aware of this is reported for a pet. I had this once happening with a team member. After a heavy fight, I couldn't 'see' him any longer. He was on my team list (white), he showed up on the radar map, but I couldn't see him any longer. The other team mates swore that he stood one step aside of me all the time??? After zoning the situations was back to normal.

Regardless of the reason, FC said it was fixed when it is only really partially fixed.  On my way to EFP with a team, I was the only one had any trouble with their yalm unequipping after a zone, the other 5 people in the team had no problems with their yalms unequpping.  So, 5 out of 6 working properly is better then the stats before, but please, its rather annoying to us in the minority.

If this information helps, I have an implant with a vehicle air skill boost installed.  So I'm assuming maybe the implants still aren't being checked in the proper order.

Please fix this bug entirely.

Okay, so a 5 out of 6 fix isn't that bad, but the fact that they claim to have fixed Quantum Wings the same way is a complete fallacy.  No one I know with QW can zone and keep flying.  This was clearly not even tested before they stated it was fixed, considering all it would take to test would be one flight to a zone line anywhere in Rubi-Ka.

Example: I fought against a light orange mp-npc and i hit him for only 19 points. Sometimes a little bit more, between 20-30; also i only crit once over 3 fights approx. – isnt very often i think...a minimun of once per fight should be a better idea.

3. Some (human)NPCs dont heal slower.
Example: The same mp-npc hits very fast! And he heals himself also too fast for me. I had to zone out more then once. Atleast i couldnt kill him and cried for help... an mp (with to phat pets, one red the other dark orange) helped me out. His 2 pets killed him easily.

4. HP-bug while zone is still here. The first time i zoned into the missions i lost everytime some hps.

5. NPC nanoprogramms work better, also they interrupt ur own more often. Bug or features?!

6. Runspeed seems to work better after this patch. A difference of 100 in runspeed make realy a difference.

The QL of the Bows could be better, but before that patch i was able to solo yellow and light orange mobs. Especially with zoning out/in...

1) Is the auto-attack after casting an attack nano a bug or a feature? I had read somewhere that you said it was the latter but can't find it in the many, many threads asking about it. If it is the latter, why wasn't it in the patch notes? How do you expect roots, charm, mezz, etc. to work?

2) You have pledged over and over that you will stop introducing new features that are not in the patch notes, yet you continue to do it. This prevents us from knowing what is a bug and what is a feature and causes massive confusion.

3) Will players ever be allowed to enroll in the official clans (Knights, Sentinels, etc.) and Omni departments?

1) Please read my reply here.. It is a bug.

2) Sorry, could you elaborate a bit? I'm unclear what you are referring to. Are you talking about the auto-attack (if it was intended) or something else?

3) I'll get back to you on that. I don't have the answer right now. Would be great though.

Thanks for that information Garnock. I know implant checking has been a problem in the past, so your statement does sound plausible. I'll check with QA to see to see what's going on and bring you guys an answer.

Hey Cosmik, can you check out Quantum Wings too?  There is definitely still a problem with it.  Just run it on yourself and zone and I guarantee you'll be on the ground with no QW when you get to the other side of the zoneline.

all you have to do now is overthink your strategy again, imho
e.g. drop you damn pistol, equip a lower melee weapon with 2m range ... or sit back and hug your pillow   (ok i dont play a nt or something, but i did in beta and remeber that i could nuke some monsters while standing right next to them without getting aggroed, i think you want this again ?) 
			
		
	
Calming a NPC should not cause me to attack it.  This sort of defeats the purpose.  I don't care about attacking if I am nuking it, that is acceptable.  But attacking breaks roots(well if they worked) and certainly breaks calm on a NPC.  I am not talking about nukes, heck I hit q alot before I start the Nano.  But I certainly don't want to attack something I am trying to calm.

This is a bug.

2) There have been a lot of stealth nerfs and stealth enhancements. Because of this when we see something in the game that is new we don't know if it is a bug that needs to be reported and fixed or an intentional change. People started reporting and complaining about the auto-attack bug/fix as soon as the patch was in place and yet on your bug list it wasn't there. Since neither it or the upgrade of mission loot were on the bug list, we had to assume that they were stealth fixes even though they were not on the patch notes. All we ask is that the patch notes include everything that is changed, with the obvious exception of details on exploit fixes.

3) This is a yes or no question that I started asking in October. Others were asking it before me, via both the forums and in direct emails. You said two weeks ago that my unanswered questions list, which included this, went to the development crew for answers. The ability to join Omni departments was, at the very least, STRONGLY implied in your literature. Why is this very obvious, yes or no question taking months to answer? How many more upgrades in your customer service is it going to take to get a simple 'yes' or 'no' to a question that a good percentage of your player base is needing in order to make important decisions about the future of their characters?

Invisibility definitely happens with pets. It has happened several times with my crat pet, though I don't remember it with my MP pets. It is often coupled with an odd damage bug where it looks like my pet is not doing damage to a monster but when I hit him all the damage done so far is applied. I like to think that the monster is as surprised by being instakilled as I am when it happens to me. :]

Hopefully this will explain advens that drop reet form when zoning.  My 28 adven has this same issue with zoning and dropping reet form everytime.

Granted its only 11 NP to recast but it still seems dumb that I would have to recast this everytime when I meet the requirements with my implants in.  I would hope that active buffs and implants woudl always be checked for upon zoning.  These are very valid ways of having a prog running or equipping an item.

Zaal @ 11/30/2001 6:11:23 PM (NT attack nanos = ATTACKING - other classes cant shoot themselves - make it fair! 2526):
Ok, before the latest change to auto attack that now makes all casting classes autoattack whenever casting a nano on a mob we could cast these nanos on ourselves as well.  I would have to say that now that we are BEING FORCED to attack physically when we cast our damage nanos, that if you plan on keeping it this way that you remove the ability to cast damage nanos on ourselves.  Other classes can't shoot themselves and I always thought that NOT auto attacking physically with weapons was the fair trade off for the chance of hitting your self in combat.   Not to mention mezz lines of nanos which are supposed to prevent combat.??????  Does this make any sense to you Funcom?

Cosmik?  A little help here please.  This change is wrong.

This can be pretty lethal on higher danger missions when trying to pull a single NPC from a room with multiple baddies as you have to physically enter the room to get the action going...

I could zone with my plane yesterday, if it was over ground. I tried it over water and got stuck in the water like always before.

Before this last fix, my plane didn't de-equip like everyone elses, had to do it manually. Strange.

Taelyn @ 11/30/2001 7:06:03 PM (2306):
The minimum damage on MOBs is outrageous.  No weapon that PC's can get anywhere in game does near the minimum damage of the MOB weapons.  Funcom needs to really rework its combat system.  Of course, they won't, they're busy adding useless features and fixing their own accidents.

Esmee @ 11/30/2001 7:39:03 PM (1951):
Yme if you think that overequipping is exploiting then you seriously don't know how to play the game. it is an inherent part of the game and if funcom didn't mean for it to be than they seriously overlooked something lol.

Get to work. it seems like the people complaining are just lazy.

Breaku @ 11/30/2001 7:56:11 PM (Flurry of Blows 2536):
Flurry of blows is supposed to increase your melee init. for a few seconds... and then its supposed to run out and your melee init. is supposed to go back to the same number your melee init was.


But its not working... sometimes u hit flurry of blows and it actually gives u 2X's the amount that it was supposed to give. That's GREAT! ... cause then i hit like a chainsaw.. 2 hits per sec. But!... then my melee init doesn't go back to its original number, it acutally drops me to a (-) negative melee init... exactly the same amount that one hit of it would give me... So, im thinking that sometimes it acts up and gives u 2X's the amount u need rather than just one dose... followed by 2X's the reduction after..

Suprised im the only one taht ever mentioned it.

Its great for PVP.... but i feel like its an exploit of some sort?... for PVm its sucks cause i have to zone to get my numbers back to the way they are supposed to be.

roodawg @ 11/30/2001 8:00:30 PM (1951):
I've been reading this argument regarding overequipping by you NT's.

First, we aren't overequipping. We are using the best 'quality' items we're able to fit into. The description for the items is QL--- quality level--- not PL--- player level. How old is that rifle? How much damage have those second hand pants had to absorb? Get it. It's the quality of the item not the level of the player.

Without using any implants, buffs or items that add to your skills we still are going to have different abilities depending on the path we choose for our characters. I'm an agent, without any buffs I can still use a weapon up to 10-15 ql's above my PL depending on weapon and where I spend my ip's at lower levels. All I need to do is max out the stats for my chosen weapon and armor and ignore my nano abilities, for example.

Secondly, please explain the purpose, as stated before, of an entire line of nano's in the game that last for only 3 minutes. Per your argument I will need to have that trader surgically attached to my hip to utilize his skills. Skills I pay for btw. The wrangle line only last for 3 minutes. It's only purpose is to temporarily raise a players skills long enough to equip a weapon, make a better pet or, in the case of NT's, learn a better nano. I realize you won't be able to use it after those 3 minutes but that leads to my next point.

Thirdly, provide this entire community with the following comparison. You aren't able to use a nano unless your stats meet the criteria 'when' you try to run it. Sounds fair. You're getting twisted all out of joint about my ability to continue using my rifle even if I don't meet it's criteria when I pull the trigger. So here's the comparison I'd like you to provide. Compare the damage output of your nano's per QL to our rifle per QL. You want to nerf several other classes, "again", because of QL issues. I'll agree to it if, and only if, you'll agree to make your QL50 nano have comparable damage output to a QL50 stigma rifle. Now that sound fair to you?

My point is that NT's are the biggest damage dealer's in the game but are whining because other classes are able to increase their effectiveness. Why?  We aren't exploiting and we're not cheating. We 'are' doing the work to train our characters, to equip our characters and we're going through the pain and anguish to implant our character's.

The "exploits" that allowed persons to "grossly" overequip have already been fixed. The surgery clinics no longer allow stacking of treatment skill and the NCU's to get the huge buffs are no longer available. Without those ncu's you can't hold the buff btw. Not sure if you understood that.

So how about, for once, you people that whine about us other players just shut up and work on your own characters. It can be rewarding, not fun, rewarding to improve your toons. And you NT's  ask for some buffs for your class that allow improvement to your class. Please stop trying to hurt other classes.

Umm, reet form dropping when you zone is the same side effect as the implant's not being rebuilt before off-hand weapons checks and vehicle equipment checks.  That's not a nerf, side effects are bugs.

I just use a coat now, if you havn't raised str then I suggest you go with nano for now.

 I use BodyDev implants, and it seems the health they add is what is lost when I zone. Is it a problem with the BodyDev check?

Hope you guys get this one fixed soon, there is nothing worse then zoning into a pvp area already wounded.

Shaedow @ 11/30/2001 9:57:51 PM (2029):
I agree. I currently have a 37 level MA and most missions are unfinishable due to the minimum damage bug. This is incredibly frustrating and the only way to get any mission tokens now is to team up. I was told by a GM a couple of days ago that it would be fixed by the next patch, but after installing the patch I found I still had the problem. Grrrrrrrrr. Does anyone know any work arounds by adjusting the mission settings?

cson @ 11/30/2001 10:10:45 PM (2029):
Yeah, at lvl 72 with a full set of QL 125 implants, I was clearing QL 100 missions within an hour. I'd level in three hours just doing three missions with all reds. I never had to buy armor because I would get them as mission rewards. I had 5 mil in the bank after buying my Yalmaha and all my implants (and paying 250k to have them built). 

Now at lvl 93, I've the the same old implants. Only way I can level fast is go to Mort and hope that a team will pick up a gimped MA. Don't get me wrong, I look good on paper. 670 Attack Rating, 2700 AC, 2700+ HPs, Vulnerability Seeker. But when a lvl 89 trader next to you constantly hitting for 2000 and a lvl 90 soldiers hitting for 2500+, and you're doing 103 damage, you feel pretty damn useless.

You used to get xp from them way back when, but peeps were killing the juggernauts and slayerdroids right next to the save terminal.

To resolve that issue, you were made not to get xp from same-aligned mobs as you.  

That in itself wasn't a big issue.  The omni-aligned mobs in the missions didn't attack, but, you get a mission full of em, run right through and blammo, you done.

To resolve that issue, they made all mobs in missions aggressive.

So then we arrive at our current state of affairs.  So, not truly a bug, but a highly irritating scene nonetheless.

Most casters CAN buf their nano skills by at least the general expertise amount and most by MUCH more than that.
I play a level 68 Trader and when I'm in missions I chain cast deprive/ransack and then KEEP casting the last ones on every mob so they don't run out. This way I can cast my best mez and health funnel line which are WAY beyond my unbuffed ability to cast...around 200 points beyond my unbuffed ability.

And think of this... If NT were able to over eq. we could do thousends of damage at lvl 10! Would that be fair to you other profs? No it wouldnt! Thats why over eq. is cheating! Its realy unfair and the game isnt ment to be that way! You shouldnt be able to equip anything that is higher lvld than you! Now that I think about it I would like to be able to over eq. as a NT... I could probobly nuke a lvl 140 with my lvl 44 NT if I wanted to!
Let me say this again... Over eq. was nmot intended by FC, therefor it is an expliot, bug and/or cheating! and again... its not meant to be part of the game therefor cheating, bug and exploiting!

Buffs are obviously supposed to be in the game. The problem isn't the ability to buff but rather how much you can buff. It's too easy to stack different nanos + wrangler and all that junk. The only real way to fix this is by putting a full-time skill chec, making these 'buffing' nanos last about 30 minutes, or to reduce amount of buffing + disallow the ability to stack nanos.

Ignorance is bliss. Only caster that can buff their nano skills is MP. I hardly consider Trader a caster, but whatever. NT's have 0 skill buffs for nanos, Crats have 0 nano skill buffs, Docs (I don't think) have no nano skill buffs, Engs (If you consider them a caster) have no nano skill buffs.

Misophist @ 12/1/2001 7:42:51 AM (2475):
Chaos missions have been working for me since they beefed up human MOBs and failed to correct this problem in the latest patch. These missions are only easier because I'm not hitting the creatures for 62 - 62 - 62, and can complete them in a fair amount of time. Other than that, monster MOBs tend to hit a lot harder, and those big warbot type things are a pain in the ass.  But I'd rather that than watch my MA -- who by nature hits light, fast damage -- resort to even lower damage against human green mobs. 

About 75% of the time I get monster MOBs on the chaos/bad/money setting (hidden seems to decrease chance of picking up all monsters), and the other 15% I'll get a mix of humans and bots/monsters, or all humans and scooplets. I delete the latter unless it's for a really good item.

It's the difference between what your computer says and what the server says.  Since the server is the one that does the damage and the inv control, only those shots count towards damage and ammo.  When it string-phantoms, thats a pc-server desync (probably); your computer says you are HERE and their server says you are THERE.  Your computer has no mechanism for checking your location.  It's particularly bad when your computer thinks you are out of range of the mob, and the mob is meleeing you, because it's in the right place (according to the server).  Some shortcut, bandwidth- and processor-saving piece of code makes your computer check to see if you're in range, so if your computer thinks you are at X,Y; and their server thinks you're at D,H; and the distance is all wrong, you can't attack because you're out of range, but the mob can (and does) because they are in range...  It leads to big problems.

I've been asking for a /resync command for a while now (started shortly after the first forum wipe), so we don't have to alt-f4-f4 and reload AO to just get back into sync.  And a resync command would be really simple.  It would just warp you to where the server says you are, as well as warping any critters in view-distance.  Simple as 3.14159265359....

Meetshield @ 12/1/2001 9:11:41 AM (1951):
Today I got a bunch of new implants, buffed MA up real high, and put on a new set of fists that were way above my QL.  Now when I lose the buffs, the fists will stay equipped and I will be able to do much more damage..... /sigh  Not everyone can benefit from being able to buff into a weapon and then still use it when your sklills drop back to normal.  This is why OE is flawed.  It puts certain classes at a greater advantage over others.  MAs are supposed to do the most damage over time, but what good is that if in pvm you only hit for minimum damage, and in pvp you dont stand a chance against rooters and over equppied agents, soldiers and enforcers who can drop you in seconds.  Kind of hard to do much damage over time when you get blasted and are dead in seconds.

I saw someone who came up with a great idea for handling over equipping in pvp, since the biggest problem with it is with people who are at lower levels, heavily twinked so they can own at pvp.  The way you handle pvp over-equipping, is when the check is run to see if you are in the level range to fight a person, it also checks your weapon and makes your pvp level that of your weapon QL (note this is only necessary for players under 75).  So now that level 30 with the QL90 weapon, will be put in the 75-200 pvp pool, and wont be able to touch people near his level who he would destroy with little effort.

pvm is gonna be harder since the mobs are so hard now because of balancing against over-equippers.  Thats a tough one and I dont have any clue how to handle it, but if they leave it alone Im sure you will be seeing a lot more of the classes that are the most able to over equip.  They are already all over the place as it is.  What fun is playing a game with 300 agents, 500 enforcers, 250 soldiers and 20 crats, 40 MPs, 10 Engineers, and 60 NTs?  Thats how they appear to be steering this game.

I dont have any answers, and Im not even sure over equipping is all bad, but it does have some negative consequences for several classes who cant do it as easily as others.  A lot of people argue that some classes should be stronger than others, but the fact is most of those people saying that are playing the stronger classes.  Game balance is achieved when there is a good enough reason to play any class.  Game balance is when no matter what class you play, life should be no more or less difficult than others, or you take away a lot of the reasons to play certain classes.  Game balance is NOT when you have each class balanced on their own strengths against other classes weaknesses.  You cant tune the game based on an over-equipped soldier or enforcer, which is the case in pvm, and say its balanced for a crat or MA also.  Right now it isnt.   Mobs have so many hp and hit so hard and fast that unless you can do as much damage as the over-equippers, you dont stand a chance.  The arguement the offenders use is that we should all spend the time and effort to over-equipp like they did.  That arguement would be valid if every class was capable of doing just that.... but they arent.

Tymbrimi @ 12/1/2001 9:12:09 AM (Deflection Sheild Projectors broken? 2597):
Can anyone confirm whether Deflection Sheild Projectors (little Riposte-based devices you put in utility slot then right click to use - supposedly puts up a small damage reflect shield vs close combat attacks) are currently broken or am I just missing something here.

I have the Riposte skill listed on the item, put it in utility slot and get nothing but "you are unable to use this...check the item description" messages when I right click it.

Thanks,

Bjond @ 12/1/2001 9:56:54 AM (13.2 yalmaha drops on zoning 2598):
Everytime I zone in a Yalmaha, it unequips and removes itself from the quick-bar.  I've heard some say this is caused by implants, but I have no sky-pilot implants.  My vehicle air skill exactly matches the Yal's requirements, though.  Perhaps you should be using a "<=" instead of "<" when rebuilding after a zone.

Reproduce by: zoning with Yalmaha equiped.

Work-around: none.

[This bug was announced fixed in 13.2.  It's not.  Was it even tested?]

Criseyde @ 12/1/2001 9:58:34 AM (265):
I can get into and out of the water okay.  My problem are my pets.  Any room with water that you have to jump to get out of will make my pets stuck.  I have to either terminate them and recast or just wait for them to die if they can't hear my terminate command.  My pets are baloons that float above me... but I guess they still need to jump and dont have the ability.   It's always a disappointment when the mission is in a cave area since my pets stick with me alot better in the office type places.

Bjond @ 12/1/2001 10:05:58 AM (13.2 inventory is not sunny-side up 2599):
My inventory scrambles if I re-order any of the no-drop items and zone.  My bag contents re-order themselves if I just open and close them.  These were announced fixed in 13.2.  Did you even bother to test them?

Reproduce (inv): move a no-drop and zone.
Reproduce (bag): open bag, close bag, open bag.

Work-around (inv): bag your no-drops, /terminate, then pull the items you want out in the order you want them. Don't remove the no-drops.  Scan.  Zone.  Log out and then back in.  Now take out your no-drops (it's better to leave them bagged or banked, though).

Work-around (bag): none.

BTW, that's the first time I've heard inept and incompetent programmers refered to as "container gnomes".  Looks like you missed a few.

Bjond @ 12/1/2001 10:18:06 AM (13.2 MOB level -- 100% grey at 49% 2601):
The MOB level in missions was announced "fixed".  I've not noticed a single change, either at level 62 or at level 18 (the levels at which I most often play).  At both levels, a mission 1 click down from 50% yields a mission 100% full of no-xp grey mobs.

L62, 49%:  95% grey, 5% min. green
L18, 49%: 100% grey
L62, 50%: 95% min. green, 1 or 2 yellow or +1 orange
L18, 50%: 30% high green, 40% even, 20% +1 orange, 10% +2 orange

This is zero change from 13.1.  IMHO, a 50% mission should be nearly 100% even con yellow with 1 or 2 -1/+1 MOBs and there should not be such a huge difference between 49% and 50%.  You might as well just lop off the lower half of the mission slider.

Tighten up the range on MOBs to +1/-1 of the mission QL.  Give a MOB an automatic -1 for each additional MOB in the same room.  If you want to ****e it up, on rare occasion, generate one +2 MOB and make sure he's packing something.

Bjond @ 12/1/2001 10:33:46 AM (13.2 weapon+fist bugs (not fixed for 3 months now) 2602):
Weapon+fist is still buggy after at least 3 months of reports and replies of "we're working on it".  Could y'all maybe stop just "working on it" and *fix* it?

Weapon+fist #1: zone with weapon+fist equiped and fist will no longer attack.  Work-around: unequip/reequip weapon when zoning.

Weapon+fist #2: attack skill debuf stops fist from attacking (eg. deprive or ransack).  Work-around: if you live through the fight with your damage rate halved, zone out and back with weapon unequiped and reequip it after zoning (and retrace your steps in the mission to relight the map).

Weapon+fist #3: if buffed with weapon equiped, fist stops working (exploitable by griefers in 75% zones).  Work-around: same as #2.

Weapon+fist #4: if an MA-skill buff wears off (or really if the MA skill changes in any way for any reason) and you have a weapon equiped, the fist stops working.  Work-around: same as #2.

BTW, from what Funcom has said in various interviews, a new fist is generated whenever the MA skill changes.  However, this fist is not equiped if a weapon is in use.  So?  Equip it.  Sounds like it needs 10 minutes of fixing to me .. not 3 months of "working on it".

Lionel @ 12/1/2001 10:44:36 AM (Fix to "Take it easy" is a masterpiece of coding technology! 2605):
FC has made a step forward in coding technology that will make humankind a lot better... err...

Now seriously, renaming "Take it easy" to "Wait for previous action to finish" (or whatever) is not a fix!! I'm sick of this bug happening over and over!! How many times do you need to fix this bug? Maybe in the 20th try you will get rid of it?

Bjond @ 12/1/2001 10:49:02 AM (13.2 pets follow target OOR and OOZ 2606):
Pets will follow a target OOR (out of range) and OOZ (out of zone).  This is especially annoying, since you can't always recover a lost pet; eg. /pet heal <target>, target runs off, pet zips off after, never to be seen again.

Pets should not leave voice range and if they do manage to get OOR due to bad pathing, they should teleport to the owner.  This would fix about 99% of the bad pathing on pets.  They should never follow anyone but the owner into another zone.

Work-around: none, though you can make a /pet guard macro and quickly target yourself and hit it if your heal or kill target looks to be in danger of getting OOR.

I know they are 2 different things, but Ive never seen the second, only Take it easy.

But now, in 13.2 for me Take it easy has been replaced for Wait to previous... I get it exactly under the same circunstances, and I cannot fight back or initiate an atack until I zone or relog.

psych54 @ 12/1/2001 3:10:29 PM (Some annoying bugs 2625):
Ok here are some very annoying bugs:
1) I cant get any tokens any more, i dont know why but i cant.  I always clear out an entire mission before completing it.  I even double-check because i want to get a token for every mission.  I have 45 tokens now and apparently i cant get anymore of them, even if i kill 100% of the monsters, i get 0% chance that i get a token now this if very very very very annoying.
2) In the beginning u get the chance to choose ur height and with of ur character, the comp says this doesnt affect the game in any way EXCEPT i have heard that yalmaha can only be used by people who are of normal size, now i ask u why wasnt this said at the beginning of the game?  I was happy with my lvl 25 char until i heard that i would never be able to drive a yalmaha, now that is also not fear.
3) why oh why are u guys picking on the Nanotechnician.  I chose this prof because if figured it would be like all other rpg's.  At first it will be hard to lvl (and it is) but when u get to a high lvl u are one of the strongest char (which is not the case).  I acctually heard that the Nt gets worse with every lvl. Now is this true???  I would like to now this so i could cancel my account if it is!!!  Every good rpg needs some sort of magic and magicians should be strong characters, not laughabely weak.  Maybe a good drain spell would work.  It would do damage to ur target and heal u at the same time (usually this type of spell is always present in every good rpg except this one). Also, u said in a patch (i dont know which one) that their would be nanos for the nt that would raise nano and health. Ok, we have got humidity extractor but which nano heals us?  We can use only basic nanos to improve our health and all of these nanos are crap at further lvl's.
4) Which brings me to my next point: why aren't their any superior or advanced basic nanos??????  I find this very strange.
5) Stop messing the game up. I think its good that u keep on patching but please stop changing good things.  It's logical that u change things that bring the game out of balance but what u are doin to NT's is just destroying gameplay for some people.  Why do Nt's have spells which do 2000-3000 damage only to cap it to 1500???? There isn't ANY logic that can explain something like that!!! Please THINK before acting

thanks for listening,

Misophist @ 12/1/2001 5:34:53 PM (2598):
I spoke to the GM Ninzo yesterday afternoon about this very problem. I do not have any air vehicle implants, but I do have a few sense implants (more than I originally thought) and several agility implants. This raises my vehicle skill quite a bit *naturally*, and though AV does not show up as a buffed green skill, my base skill probably does not meet the playshift requirements.

This is a bug. Playshift requirements are not taking into account supplemental implants OR vehicle implants, whether for ground or air.

Nianna @ 12/1/2001 6:54:35 PM (1973):
I understand what you are saying but the reality of it is that we can already carry vast amounts of inventory.  Those vast amounts of inventory mean the server has to store vast amounts of data.  If they do make it so large backpacks are bigger than small ones, they'll most likely to do that by giving small backpacks less slots than they have now.

My bank can hold 100 backpacks and each of those backpacks can hold 21 items (or is it 18?).  That's 2100 items for the server to keep track of.  My inventory can hold about 18 backpacks I think and each of those can hold 21 items, that's another 488 items for the server to keep track of.  Compare this to EverQuest where you can hold a max of something like 80 items in your inventory and 100 items in your bank and you'll see that Funcom's server is already having to do a whole lot more work.

Taelyn @ 12/1/2001 7:08:12 PM (Bug's I've noted (with some details) 2637):
1)  Implants with Bow Special Attack are incorrectly labelled "Poison Resistance.  Long term bug, should be easy to correct.

2)  When you attack an enemy, then move to the range where it says, "Attacked by [NONE]", then move back into range of the monster, you are unable to iniate combat or fight it except with specials.  I noted this several times.

3)  Damage shields don't stack.  Or at least not consistently.  I'm not sure if they're supposed to.  I have a ring that gives me a 2 point damage shield, and the Adventurer Firefly damage shield (which does 11).  Occasionally the shield did 13, but only very rarely.

4)  You are able to go over your NCU limit, in very limited circumstances it appears.  I have 35 NCU and was running the following:  Firefly, Brawl Exp, 1HE Exp, Lesser Wilderness Prot., Free Movement.  I believe these add up to 42 NCU.  No idea what the bug is.

5)  I again ran into the bug where suddenly you are unable to loot corpses or use treatment kits until you zone.  Very annoying, its still quite there, but rare.  It'll be hard to reproduce.  The one time I had it happen today, I healed using the Adventurer's Greater Heal, then quickly sat and used a treatment kit.  Both healing messages appeared at the same time due to lag.  After that I was unable to loot or use another treatment.

6)  Some items cannot be moved to store sell windows from backpacks, but most can.  Next time I'll try to take notes on which items, but it appears to mostly be some weapons.

It's been bugged like that scince release.  It didnt increase 2x for me, but it certainly dropped my Melee init more then it should have.  Zoning Fixes it, but then you zone for each time you use the thing, it gets tiresome.  

The buffing/debuffing was always bugged to some degree.  Some debuffs will return more after it expires as well.  Like that Root that makes your run speed like +500 points when it wears off.  At any rate, the flurry bug was intermittant for me , and usually was ok as long as i didnt switch targets during the flurry, but that was just speculation, I got bugged with it so much i stopped using it.

You can also tweak the graphics down a bit and that will help.

So THATS it?!  I've been trying to get people to tell me why my deflection sheild wasn't working, and nobody even knew what the f*ck I was talking about.  It runs off of parry.

I'm gonna go try to use it w/o a gun equiped.

If it works, I'm gonna /petition (ha!) for my IP back from parry, since the only reason I got it was to save a bit of damage for when the bad guys get close (I'm an NT).  At the very least they could have added that to the description.  AAARRRGGGG

Ahhh - that makes a certain amount of sense.  I'll try that next time and hopefully that solves that problem for me.

I do use ranged weapons but figured the Deflection Shield might be handy when those melee mobs close and start handing me my ass like they always do.  I don't mind unequipping the weapon to activate the shield as I do very little damage with the weapon anyway.

Thanks for the info.

Cz @ 12/2/2001 11:53:25 AM (2623):

Karmantra @ 12/2/2001 2:24:18 PM (2597):
The deflection sheild only works on melee based damage from enemies, and that is probably why you don't see any reflection messages (although I never see messages with this similar to the bracer in another thread). The Riposte skill is also like this where it will only work against melee, and if you are using melee or bare hands, and I think the deflection sheilds I have are based on that stat (not like spydr ranted about parry).

There are two things two of us are talking about here - I'm talking about the Deflection Shield Projector (which is Riposte-based, reflects damage and only works against melee attacks), the one the other person refers to is the Deflection Shield which works against all damage types but only deflects rather than reflects damage, and is Parry-based.

Tymbrimi @ 12/2/2001 3:57:48 PM (2641):

I don't know whether to complain or remain hush hush about it.  It seems the upped the spawn rate, but there is one Medusa that is particularly nasty.  Like REALLY nasty.  Like 3200 hit points nasty..  One of my guild mates /petitioned and the ARK said that it is  "intended to be this way.  It is aimed at multi group high levels to kill." 

Adds a little twist in which Elite Soldier you choose to Kill..   I really hope they keep EFP Med spawn the same as it is now!  Fortunatly my group only got this mob twice, once after we had just started and a second time after a save break.  So my suggestion is to watch that tank, if he goes down after one hit.....  Get in your plane ASAP!

Another thing, I really hope that they implement more hunting areas for higher levels.

starknaked @ 12/2/2001 8:17:46 PM (Pets hopelessly bugged 2704):
Five months now the game has been live, and still pets are hopelessly bugged.

Here are some problems with MP pets which occur regularly:

1. Attack pet won't attack

2. Healing pet won't heal

3. Neither pet will follow you properly or at all

So, every function that pets are supposed to carry out is bugged.  Note that these problems don't happen occassionally, they happen constantly.

After FIVE MONTHS!

All pet professions should be charged half price due the the ridiculously buggy pet system Funcom is punishing them with.

I'm not even an MP, for god's sake, I'm an agent, but I tried out the MP pets and found them to be so horribly bugged they're not worth bothering with.  How can pet professions stand to play this game?

starknaked @ 12/2/2001 8:20:30 PM (2704):
For any Funcom employees who might be reading this, have you actually tried doing a mission as a pet profession?

Just try it once.  Go into one of the cave missions, with the tiny little rooms and junk cluttering the floor and pools of water and acid.  These are approximately 2/3 of the missions we get in this game.

Try it even one time, then tell me how you can justify charging players who play pet professions for this game.  You should be paying them to suffer through this.

This is the same reason range extenders only really become useful after level 50. Oops, my bad. Range extenders aren't useful for anyone now since the range is CAPPED at 40m.!!!!!!!!!

Yeah, it's just wishful thinking, but imagine it. We would be rich! Payed to betatest!

Scorus @ 12/2/2001 10:26:56 PM (2702):

As an engineer, I have both reflect and deflect shields.

I also have 2 kinds of bracers that shields against projectile damage.

Neither kind of damage is reported in any way, and that seems like they are bugged to me. They might add up, but there are problems with them nontheless.

WGMelchior @ 12/2/2001 10:54:36 PM (2702):
I only get get 4k IP per level until I get to level 15. Are you absolutely sure you get 5k with your other characters? Can you check it up again, because you are only supposed to get 4k.

Mephistopheles @ 12/3/2001 12:00:10 AM (Mission Issues STILL. 2717):
Problems with missions as I see them.

All the way Bad Order Money

I did a mission today or tried to...I got pissed after 20minutes of fighting the same mob.

Issues

1. MOBs still heal to fast
2. MOBs have too many hitpoints
3. MOBs dont give enough experience for them taking 20minutes to kill
4. MOBs hit to hard
5. MOBs of your level are way better then you are
6. *pulls out hair*


I am level 100 fighting a yellow MOB in this scenario if I actually was able to kill the mob im sure i would have gotten like 10k exp whoopde dooo dah!  man that is so lame.

I couldnt kill the mob even after I pulled it to the door to attack it and I was using challenger of the gargantula...I was able to get it down to less then 1/4 but since i was almost dead I had to bail. by the time I was fully healed the mob was at more then 3/4 life...man what am I missing here...do you actually expect us to complete a mission...

Some questions I have...

1. How long do you expect a level 100 mission to take to complete 1hour? 5 hours? 2 days?
2. Is doing missions supposed to be a justifiable way of gaining experience?  If so then why do the mobs take 20min to kill each...if your lucky
3. Are missions geared to people who can UBER twink thier characters? if so why the hell is it this way? Your punishing the people who dont have alot of money...and who dont uber twink or who can't...I use 2he weapons with my enforcer I would suspect that one SHOULD be able to do this as a viable option to the game...personally I dont want to be a CLONE
4. Is there really diversity in a game which requires people to use all the same skillsets to actually be successful? BLEH.

Misophist @ 12/3/2001 4:14:09 AM (2717):
I dread getting to this point in the game. Especially with my MA. Bleh, bleh, bleh! The high level game sucks, basically, and this topic has been covered in a lot of threads. I don't look forward to life past 75 for any of my characters, and I level slower than molasses on a cold winter's day due to the high-level game, or lack thereof. 

Along with the high level game are the high level missions, which hardly anybody can solo past a certain point. I don't mind grouping up with guild buddies on a really hard mission, but the option to solo should ALWAYS be present, no matter what level, especially if one is a casual gamer. 

Funcom thought people were levelling too fast, and thus the game must have been too easy. So they beefed up some aspects of PvM. If making the game more difficult past level whatever was a ploy to decrease the rate of levelling, well, I can't say it was terribly effective. Personally, I find hunting to be boring and fruitless beyond levelling, even if some of the high level mobs DO drop good stuff. People resort to it because it's really the only thing to do after a certain point, and they still manage to get a lot of levels per day. 

Rather than be forced into the inevitable level treadmill, I'd like to retain some semblance of self-sufficience as I gain levels -- instead of losing the abilities I loved as a lower level character. 

There's a BIG balance issue in the way PvM is dealt with on a solo basis. Even at level 54, it's not easy. It just gets harder and harder until you're no longer viable on your own. Or barely. I know very few people who solo missions past level 80ish.

The only idea I have to slightly reduce the difficulty of the game past level XX and also keep levelling at a reasonable rate is this: decrease the amount of experience one gets per kill while ALSO reducing MOB hitpoints, MOB heal rate and increasing the amount of damage against human NPCs (I'm still hitting for minimum.). 

I realize this might be an unpopular notion. But honestly, I'd rather be able to solo mobs in missions, complete missions in less than an hour and get less experience than muddle through missions while I take 20 mintues per solo kill, leading to a 2-3+ hour mission. Group hunting would yield less experience, too, but if you're killing red mobs, it wouldn't be that drastic of a difference.

Well, that's all. I agree that the game gets progressively more difficult, and though this may be intended, it has the effect of making the game a lot less fun.

cman @ 12/3/2001 4:54:49 AM (2641):
nice of em to fix recompilers so that they work, and then remove 6 slot belts u need to use em from mission rewards at the same time aint it?

oh and removin the NCUs from mission rewards u need when u eat up NCU slots for nano toys was a nice addition too,

bring back belts and ncu's!

But after zoning in.. I've ended up moving at my SWIM SPEED. Which is damm slow for most pple

Xen @ 12/3/2001 6:21:11 AM (1951):
Well I have no problem with people over equiping, it just shouldn't be permenant.  Buffs running out and debuffs should affect your capability with equipment.

Zuleica said
1. Funcom has purposely designed NUMEROUS methods of temporarily increasing skill in nearly EVERY skill. What other purpose but to equip beyond your level would all these methods be? I specifically point to MANY nanos that do NOTHING more than temporarily increase skills.


Key word is temporarily.  Yet now temporarily applies only to nano formulas and ma/brawl etc and not anything else.

This seems like an obvious oversite on FCs part that they attemped (but failed) to correct back in 12.6. 

I will agree that overequiping is not and should never be considered an exploit, even now.  Equipment should not unequip (like previous attempt) but simply become less effective until a new buff is found or a debuff wears off.

Why is that not fair?

No, you're not the only one.  I lose 120 hp after zoning which, sometimes and randomly I can get back by pressing U and Accept.  The extra problem is I don't have BodyDev implants of 120 but of 28, while my token board gives Max Health of 49, so where the 120 comes from I've got no idea.

 By this status and equip.
 I saw "non hit success 30sec" often against bottom green POD  NPC.
 90% swing animation has no damage.
 Almost 100% case, I need about 5minutes for kill green NPC.
 Need 3min for yellow to POD +1.

 If this at low level, I can upgrade weapon or Implant.
 But this char already maxed level, max ql weapon, only 10-20 skill gain if I can equip ql200 Implants.
 Yes, there is almost nothing to do against this now.

 If this is feature, its too lame design.
 Not feature, there is something AMS bug.

Kinkstaah @ 12/3/2001 2:08:29 PM (2768):
Heh. Mal. Heres the thing.
I also dual weild weapons. I posted it in Game mechanics. Although you swing like crazy, you only actually hit very very minutely faster than a guy with a 2 hand rider warblade.

It sucks. I just want to know whether its intended or not.

Avedis @ 12/3/2001 2:51:58 PM (2605):
I've died in missions because of this piece of incompetent programming. Here's some advice. Manually reload your Flashpoint. When you use the first of your specials, make sure the message comes up on the screen before you move on to the second, then the third. Doing the alpha strike too quickly will put you into bug mode, and just when you thought your burst and fullauto is there to save your life, you're bugged until that mob, or you, dies. 
If you're in a team, target an ally, attack him (in 25%+ zone!), retarget mob, then attack, the bug might have cleared.

Stitchings @ 12/3/2001 3:13:13 PM (Creation of ql200 implants bugged 2780):
Members of my guild have tried to create several ql200 implants.  Some of the implants already had clusters in them, some not.  They were unable to combine a ql 200 cluster with a 200 implant.  They had more than ample skill to create these implants, and people without the skill to create them received "it is theoretically possible" messages containing the required skill.  I have heard that one implant was successfully created, though.

spydr @ 12/3/2001 3:34:14 PM (Not your usual NT range cap rant 2782):
Range extender buffs need to be looked at.  Specifically this one:   Superior Nano Command 
You'll notice how it increases nanoformula range by 67%.  Now, whats the new range of, oh say, Ice Flechette?  Ice flechette has a range of 25m.  Lets do a little math.
25 + (25 * .67) = 41.75
Wowsers!  I guess everyone using this nano was exploiting!  Otherwise they would have never capped the range at 40!


I originally posted this in the NT forum, and bits of it leaked into the meta forum, but considering that there are twice as many Cosmik posts in this forum (and more people read it) as the NT forum (thats right, four is 2x what us NT's got), so I'm hoping that I'll have a better chance at getting a Cosmik reply here.  You know, Cos, getting a real answer on this issue would quell at least 20% of the NT ranting, but probably closer to 50%.

Add a NCU range enhancer that you can buy from the shops and you could get way way higher.  They work really well,  I have heard some NT's had a range of over 80 meters with both the Nano and the NCU range increaser.

Nanogater @ 12/3/2001 3:58:34 PM (943):
Some observations:

1. I do not get xp for mobs killed by area damage nanos, only the one targetted.

2. Still grey mobs in 50% missions.

3. Yalm still uneq' when zoning.

4. Bracers with reflection does not reflect any damage at all.

5. Autoattack when using calm-series nanos.

6. No Int/Psy armor in superiour shops.

7. When is team missions being fixed, and will it include token to all teammembers inside mission area?

8. Mission map sometimes go all black, reappears when leaving that particular room.

9. If zoning out of mission or relogging inside mission, the explored area is removed from map.

10. Getting a tell from someone on 'friends' list removes that char from the list and down to 'unknown' list.

11. Sometimes the calm nano is displayed as being successfull, but mob is still fighting.

12. The reshuffeling gnome is still there, but he is located in some zones in adv/sup shops in Trade. Prob' other zones as well.

Don't remember more right now, all in all a big improvement with the 13.xx patches, (and I am a NT = can't do PvP yet so no ranting on range cap from me, yet) keep it up devs.

Since nicks clearly is NOT uniqe across RK-1 and RK-2, has FC decided to never merge the two worlds?

As stated one of my chars on RK-1 has a 'twin-nick' char on RK-2 (the creator of this char is for me unknown) and Misophist has it too.

The reason why RK-2 'missed' some 'exploits' and/or features is because RK-2 never was there in the beginning. The two dimensions have the same patches so when RK-2 was 'created' those things was removed from RK-1 as well.

Mustafo @ 12/3/2001 4:18:53 PM (2625):
OK a bit of ranting but...

Check to make sure that there was no greys in the mission.  Any greys and it lowers the chance of getting a token.  Bump it up a little if you need, you should be able to handle a 1 or 2 level bump in difficulty.

The size restriction is for nano altered size not actual size of the char.  Normal being the normal size of your character.

While NTs are difficult they are not impossible.  At level 50 I have some difficulty with 50% missions, but they aren't impossible.  I have many friends in my guild over 100 and they are having difficulty, but not finding it impossible. The game just gets more difficult as you get older this isn't just limited to NTs.  Voice your concern on the NT boards as you see the difficulty rising and find other professions to compare to.  Balance is the key to making it fun.  If one profession can do 50% missions with ease and the other can barely do them, then there is an issue.  Do some investigation with friends, and send your feedback to funcom.(without ranting or they will most likely delete it)

Zaal @ 12/3/2001 4:48:56 PM (1973):
I doubt funcom would make the smaller packs smaller.  If they did it would be adding yet another dumb blunder on top of another that Funcom has already made.  The packs being limited to 21 items as it is are rather small already as it is.  I am merely questioning the design behind have three bag sizes and not have them do anything differently.  I have never seen a bag be full becuase of a weight requirement as they have in their descriptions.  

No one has a REASON to spend 9000 above what the small pack costs because it can't hold anymore than a small pack.  As for "server memory" as you call it, whatever database they have for the items, it doesn't take much storage space for them to house the database # of each item in your possession or in your bank.  The amount of space your entire inventory takes up (in the server database of your character)  is probably smaller than the code generating these BB messages back and forth.

ZenBeck @ 12/3/2001 4:57:40 PM (Changing weapons / Specials 2796):
I use a NovaFlow as my primary and a flashpoint for the specials. As of 13.2, changing guns seems to cause problems with my special attacks. Ie full auto, fling, burst. I get the message “fullauto skill available. Change to my flashpoint, wait for it to equip, hit FA and nothing happens. In a few seconds sometimes I will see the shots go off but no damage or even “you hit with 0 bullets” …just nothing, like I never fired it. The skill will then be locked out however. This also happens from time to time with fling and burst as well. The buttons will gray out and I get the “please wait for previous attack to finish” even though I haven’t used the attack in a while.

Thanks

I used to have a very high range when I combined superior nano command and my QL125 range enhancer.  And guess what?  I never used it for PvP.  

But alas, with the nerf, I now have a range of 40m.  I don't even use my range enhancer anymore.

PLEASE FUNCOM, CHANGE THE RULES FOR PvM.  Let us have back our range when fighting creatures.

Oberan @ 12/3/2001 5:44:32 PM (2796):
This is what i find causes it (and im a melee adventurer)

Due to lag sometimes in large fights the mob is not in the place your client thinks. If your client thinks the mobs is in range it will allow you to use the special. But if on the server side the mob isn't within range your special will be used but have no effect and cause a bug sometimes making it looklike you didn't use it.

If your complaining about that just imagine what happens when a melee wastes a dimach which has the highest recharge time of all specials!!!

ZenBeck @ 12/3/2001 6:15:15 PM (2796):
I wasn’t complaining, just posting a bug.    I see the lag and always wait till I know the mob is in range (i.e. the mobs health has started falling.) If I just stick to my Nova everything seems ok. But when I change them for a special it seems to hamper all the special buttons. The button is lit up meaning skill available but when I hit it I get "please wait for previous attack to finish" or something to that effect.

No you cannot.  There are three advantages to wearing a backpack on your back.

1) It gives you one additional slot to put a backpack in.
2) If you die you will still have all equipment that is in the backpack on your back with you (you'll have to go to the reclaim for the rest).
3) You can look different than other characters who cannot wear the large backpack.

Originally I think the intention may have been that only backpacks worn on your back would reduce your weight load so the reason to wear one would be because otherwise putting a lot of stuff in your backpack would cause you to get overweight and walk slow.  Funcom never had time to get weight management working properly so eventually they made it so all bags remove the weight of all items in them.   The adventuring skill is one of the less useful skills.

Oberan @ 12/3/2001 6:36:21 PM (2641):
whats even more ironic is recompilers start at such a low level that by the time you have enough computer lit to wear a 6th slot belt you can use one about 3x its quality

Mineha @ 12/3/2001 6:49:25 PM (2605):
just hit escape, retarget and press q, no need to zone or relog
and "wait for previous action finish" before trying another special 
we're playing an online game, give some time to the packets to get to the server, doesn't hurt to wait half a second before pressing next special.
anyhow, always work for me.

Nianna @ 12/3/2001 7:00:31 PM (2768):
Everybody swings twice as fast as they actually fight.  Why?  I don't know.  I routinely shoot my shotgun twice for every shot that I see hit.  I routinely use every weapon on every character twice for every actual attack.  In dual wielding you are swinging more often so you are having non-attack swings more often.  When your non-attack swing cycles for the right and left weapon come back to back then it looks like you are missing a lot.

Mineha @ 12/3/2001 7:06:39 PM (2405):
What's weird is you guys get omni mobs in your missions.
I'm clan and even if i get my mission from a neutral terminal I only get omni-aligned npc or mobs, or neutral npc or mobs, sometimes both omni and neutral in the same mission, but never clan.

Two things here, there is a 'drain' nano, as you called it.  The Trader has both of them (nano and hp).  
The Health Funnel line takes HP and gives some of it to you.
The Line of Credit line takes NP and gives some of it to you.
The Health Payment line takes your health, and gives to your teammates.
The Lend Nano line takes your nano and gives to your teammate.

We don't get it (I'm an NT, also) but it is in the game.

For the NT health/AC thing, check out the Enfraam's line.  No heals

Because, by default, the more genericsomething is, the worse it is a specific tasts.  I.E. General nanos are, by their very nature, weak.  Although, I agree.  I wish there was a better nano to heal ourselves than the 15-25 one.  After rez sickness wears off, just use the nearest automated surgery clinic to get fully healed and nano'd up.  Be sure to buff first    300c is alot less than the amount you would spend on the health and nanochargers..at least, at higher levels.

Besides, we have the best deal when it comes to using the generic healing nano.  Our humidity extractors (at least, at higher levels) actually give us nano faster than we can use it to heal ourselves.  And even by level 30-35ish, when you first get the 51-per-tic HE, you still gain nano almost as fast as you can use it, so it's actually feasable for us to use the 15-25 healing nano to heal ourselves, whereas other classes would have to use heath packs.

But what I usually do is trade my HE to a doc, adv, or ma to heal me.  They usually jump at the chance.  I buff them, they heal me;  it's a great trade agreement.  Sometimes I throw in crunchcom and range enhancement (if they have the NCU) just for kicks.

Nianna @ 12/3/2001 7:15:55 PM (2405):

spydr @ 12/4/2001 12:20:41 AM (Sparrow Flight biograft broken..again 2851):
first, it was busted to stop an exploit (transforming monsters).  Then they fixed the exploit, and another 'exploit' was discovered (useing them to mission blitz).  So funcom made the spell (amongst others) not usuable inside.  The biograft (or at least, mine) was still bugged.  When I tried to use it, I would get the error message "Invalid Datatype Playfield=0?.." or something really close to that.  With the newest patch, they (or at least, mine) are still busted.

Now it just locks the skill for the right amount of time..but doesn't transform me.  No error message, and it looks like it should transform, but I don't.

AAARRRGGG!!!!

P.S. I'm just about to submit this (copy/paste style) as a bugreport, so don't bother telling me to do so.

I have seen backpacks full because of weight limitations.

Though I havn't seen it recently.  Could have changed it.

Arterous @ 12/4/2001 12:29:15 AM (2623):
You are only going to see 2 points reflect because they are 2 point bracers.. What you will see is 2 separate ticks of 2 points and not 4.  Ok that made sense in my head, so i hope you understand

Humm non-damage swing animation not so problem.
 Problem is "non-damage 30sec".

 "Lvl170 max skilled sword fighter keep missing attack against bottom green NPC 30 sec" is so lame.
 Offcorse during that, npc 99% success hit to me (offcorse maxed evade skill) with awsome minimum damage like 150-200.

 At battle, npc hp 100% > 50% maybe 15 - 20 sec.
 50% > 30% 1 min
 30% > 0% 3min

 I can kill yellow doc with 30% nano left.
 But sometimes green doc almost kill me.

Mine is working since 13.1 (for the first time since I bought it). Hacked biografts are supposed to only work sometimes, perhaps on your attempt it failed?

Greystar @ 12/4/2001 3:58:20 PM (2768):
Not sure if Funcom recognizes it as a bug, but it's a fact that when the mob gets lower in HP, starting from 50% down, everyone hit's less and less. When it gets down to the last few HP, my Fixer don't hit for half a minute either, my meta's spells get countered 10 times in a row and my pet doesn't hit as well...

hobbes @ 12/4/2001 4:40:30 PM (Still broken 2878):
1. The missions with the catwalk over the toxic waste still are difficult to play. When I fall into the toxic waste, I can't seem to climb out. I have fallen through walls into adjoining rooms and such. It is totally disorienting, not an asset to game play. Particularly when are under attack. It seems the monsters knock you down when you jump from room to scaffold, then you have to struggle to get out of waste again. 

If you can't fix this, then these missions should come with motion sickness bags!

2. The flurry of blows will decrease your melee init after it is done. I checked my stats and saw my init. in red and very low. Had to zone out to reset. I don't remember reading that this wassupposed to happen.

3. Some speed buffs stack in missions. While cool, its not fair. My character was running 700 in mission (235 is normal). I don't know how it happened, but it seemed to occur when monsters attemted to root me. It was like a reverse root.

Avedis @ 12/4/2001 6:30:17 PM (2605):
I'm an electrical engineer and I've done a lot of coding in school and at work. 
What makes some of these bugs so maddening is that they seem to originate from such basic mistakes in coding. I think that simply switching the order in which functions are called might solve problems. 
I have an implant to improve my drive air, but when I zone, I'm out of my Yalmaha and on the ground. Here Grimwolf! Dinner!
Seems that the program notices that I have a ql46 Yalmaha in my HUD, checks my basic drive air ability, notices it's insufficient, boots my plane into my inventory, THEN goes through my implants and adjusts my final ability points. 
Now, when your character is reloaded after zoning, you'd think that and easy fix would be to call the functions that adjust your abilities via implants and buffs BEFORE checking your vehicle or other stuff. 
Where I work, engineers aren't allowed to talk to customers, only marketers are. Trouble is, marketers are STOOOOOOOPID, but they're valued for their ability to look pretty and lie. So, we'll never hear from Funcom programmers.

megaram @ 12/4/2001 6:51:01 PM (Flingshot bugged 2907):
Whenever I decide to use flingshot while in battle, I can only use it once. 

Even thought the flingshot option become available and I try to use it, I keep getting a message "cannot use special attack until previous one has completed" or something to that effect.

This really screws up my gameplay as I am used to "watching" for that icon to not be greyed out anymore and redo the flingshot move.

Anyone else notice this with other special attack moves or is it just affecting flingshot.

I tried that man....doesn’t work.

For us Soldiers we are talking about a Flashpoint here. 12.0 sec recharge time. I could go 15 min without using it. Ok...all specials are ready. I equip it. All looks good. Puller brings mob...I hit my FA....nothing. Recharge bar is going but no shot. Finally I see what looks like a FA shot but no damage is done. Ok...lets say I missed. (allot) So now I try my burst... "wait for prev..." hmmm...   try a fling shot. same sh!t...."wait for previous attack to finish" or something to that effect. Ok so now about 20 sec's have gone by and I haven’t fired a single shot yet...  change to my NovaFlow. SPECIALS NOT AVAIABLE. well...don’t that just suck for your team who get a soldier because he can deal a good amount of damage.

NOT!

Being that these are the only 2 guns any soldier can be effective with it is a huge problem.

Hamini @ 12/4/2001 7:15:06 PM (2878):
ive had the reverse root thing happen to me...its not specific to missions, the problem occured when i was rooted when trying to get into my yal...for some reason the run speed of the yal and the absolute value of the root added together and put my runspeed well over 700..when i died, my run speed went well over 1400.. i used /terminate and found my run speed to be nearly 3000...(at this speed its no longer cool, its just hard to get to a place less than 100 m across...when i zoned everything went back to normal..

Etechie @ 12/4/2001 7:48:46 PM (2680):
haha this is AO. 
I cant find anything that mention about such change in the patch msg, its just another ark simply created some BULLSH*T to cover up the incompetence of Funcom.
It doesnt only happen in public hunting ground, I found the same thing in INDIVIDUAL mission too, a green that hit 1k, or a red that hit 3k, its so obvious its a BUG !

oh btw, look at the take it easy bug, have they fixed it ? How many times have they said they fixed it ? I think more than twice. 
And the result is they only changed the text msg, its now 'please wait for your previous attack to complete bla bla bla'

Hamini @ 12/4/2001 8:35:09 PM (2625):
first off..none of these things are really bugs except the first one..just rants, and the first one ive never even noticed

next...the reason there are no superior/adv general shops is that most of the classes get the nanos that would be in the superior/adv general shop..for example Metas and traders get +45 mastery +25 teachings and wranglers useable by lvl 30(or when adv shops start becoming useful to a character)...Docs get +35 treatment mastery(and much later a +80 treatment), soldiers can get weapon mastery skills...and then agents can use FP and use any non general buff in the game.


	
		
			
			
				
I acctually heard that the Nt gets worse with every lvl. Now is this true??? 

			
		
	
almost every class gets worse as you level.....if you think NTs get harder i suggest you try playing an MA from lvl 1-150

whats even more annoying is to see guys on ebay selling 6-slots for $25 a piece, and when you look at their screenshots they have a whole fregin bag full of the things...I think funcom is trying to make up for the enormous money they are losing on this game by selling stuff on ebay...hmmmmm?

zeroframerate @ 12/4/2001 8:55:30 PM (2414):

The exact same thing happens to my Adv using dual Riders.

But only when I'm solo in missions.

If I'm in a group fighting, I hit.  If a group is with me in my mission, I hit.

When I solo....  I hit maybe 1 time per brawl.

Satherial @ 12/4/2001 11:34:07 PM (Why are Android NCU more readily available than Player NCU in Terminals? 2938):
Subject says it all. After those dirty little things were added there's always a total of 1 NCU chip and 3 Android NCU chips in tool shops. Shouldn't it be the other way around? This is just wrong. 

Also on the subject of NCU. Why do you have to make the range so damn wide? I've been looking for 30+ NCU for 2 weeks now and haven't been able to find not one. It's funny how you'll find chips that actually go below their said minimum.

Really pisses me off at times like now where I go into a Superior Shop seeing 32-63 NCU Memory and I check the stats to find out it only gives 27. I mean come on this is bs.

Dimenon, the bodyDev points, I believe give you 3 health for every point of body dev, I think.

 Funcom, I thought you fixed this in the last patch? The fact is, as I stated earlier, is this was working fine before you messed with it. Will/is it being looked into still? This is very annoying when zoning into hostile territory, ie missions/pvp areas.

I'm going to start bumping this one untill the is an official response, as this is my only gripe with the game right now. Oh yeah and the fact that Verilent Minibulls that are grey to me always aggro on me. Going down The longest Road last night I had a train of about 5-6 minibulls 4 hammerbulls 6 scorpiods and three spiders on my ass, It was the funiest thing I have seen yet, but I could not get off a good screenshot. Wish I could have as, it was quite a sight, it looked like I was getting chased by an angry linch-mob.

Krneki @ 12/5/2001 7:32:48 AM (2780):
Some clusters don't have a QL or a modifier at all. The name is the same, but the description is kinda different, those clusters don't give any errors when you try to combine them with apropriate implants. I think it's since the newest patch, maybe 13.1 not sure. 100% screwed up tho.

megamet @ 12/5/2001 4:22:21 PM (map problems 3052):
I have been searching for a map of wartorn valley and can't find one. I searched through all the maps thinking it might be combined with another map and couldn't find it. But to my surprise I noticed that the aegean map also contained one for omni-1 hq which I think should have been the map for wartorn valley. The clan startup maps also contain a map for omni-1 hq. What gives....where is my map.

Lawbinder @ 12/5/2001 4:30:58 PM (1951):
just a few facts about the NT

1. sure NT do inflict a lot of dammage but we are also the class with least hp (Body Dev is a dark blue skill), and I have never been interupted or fumbled with my Enforcer and Soldier.

2. We use Int/Psy Armor. Psy can be boosted above the +12 buff Int cant so we cant overequipt armor (or find it in shops for that matter) 

3. We can only raise one nano skill with Impants (Mat. Crea) since all nano skill implants goes in the same implants (that includes NanoC Init). The same goes for nano pool and body dev. implants.

4. one of the more usefull items for the NT is the NCU Recompiler but sadly that has to be placed in slot6 and u cant find 6slot belts in the game since latest patch (u can get them on the shopping channel for like 20 mil)

5. the range cap (Im sure u all know about it os I will not go into it)

6. We dont have any buffs to increase any stats execpt the expertise buffs

well thats All I can come up with now, so Ill stop her.

Im NOT whining, I love playing an NT it just gets fustrating seeing most other classes gets boosted while NT gets nerfed with every patch

there should be two dimentions.

in rubi-ka 1 we keep things like they are as far as equiping equipment.  we have a variety of professions with their different strengths and weaknesses.  we have buffs, and a variety of weapons and armor of different quality levels.  those who want to take the time and resources and intelligence to figure out how to make their character use the best equipment will benefit and those who don't, wont.

in rubi-ka 2 we will have 1 profession with 1 type of armor 1 type of weapon and 1 type of nano.  everyone will cause 1 point of damage.  but there will be a lot of different clothes.  all mobs will only have 1 hitpoint and give 10000 experience and 10000 credits.  pvp is completely equal for all players and the only thing that is going to determine who wins a fight is who hits first.  oh...there are infinite levels, but it doesn't matter because all of your stats are completely maxed at the begining of the game.

in rubi-ka 1...we have all people who enjoy the game.  in rubi-ka 2 we hae all the whiners who complain about over equiping and game balance.

just a proposal!  how does that sound?

cold @ 12/5/2001 4:53:26 PM (3052):
I have a map of wartorn valley... I believe it's on the aegan map, seems to work fine for me. Do you see the other areas in that zone ?

Zaal @ 12/5/2001 4:54:05 PM (Minimum damage bug is still there I think. 3058):
Still feels like there are some broken MOBs that we still do minimum dmg on.

at 1800 x 4000 in avalon there are three sets of Mobs; Scouts, Nanoshifters and Lasersnipers.  

You can safely kill scouts without the other two sets aggroing on you.  They're dark red to me and I hit them for varying degrees of dmg.

Nanoshifters are also drk red to me and i can hit them for varying degrees of dmg.

The lasersnipers however is a completely new story.  9 every time, and 18 burst.  One guy in our group hit them for 1 every time with a 3 burst.  My pet was even hitting it for min dmg everytime, and luckily his min dmg is WAY higher than mine or we as a group would never have survived.

What's wrong with them - are they SUPPOSED to be that godly?  It feels like a bug thats giving them 2-3 times the AC they should have.

Anyway.  I hope its a bug that gets fixed soon.  Peace out.

Tamanaka @ 12/5/2001 6:17:47 PM (2878):
I think the problem with getting onto the cat-walks has to do with the change to moving into and out of water. You now have to jump to get out of water, but it seems that you can no longer jump in. Generally, when I try to jump out into the water, the games acts as if I have hit a low ceiling and bounces me directly into the water barely past the point at which the jump was started. So in the cat-walk mission, where the cat-walk does not actually touch the ground around the edges of the acid pool, it is extremely hard to make the jump to the cat-walk. This does not seem to happen when you jump from cat-walk to cat-walk, only when you are crossing the edges of a liquid.

KylSawz @ 12/5/2001 9:33:23 PM (2410):
I personally don't see what is the issue.  Why CHECK to see if someone matches the requirements to be in the yal or have QW even running?  You had to have it to get into that form and it isn't something that will last a real long time.  You can't do anything but fly while in the Yal or running QW.

I personally dislike my QW dropping every time I zone.  It means I have to keep my prebuffs refreshed for any zone wall.

Anyway, just my 2 cents!

agentgimpy @ 12/5/2001 11:23:07 PM (Bugs that were fixed(not) add yours here.. 3111):
This thread is for all of you who are still having problems with bugs that were reportaly "fixed" and for those of you who seem to think it was fixed. There seems to be a very inconsistant result, as some people reprt that things are fine yet others(like me) have had problems continue or re-occur. This makes no sense as we all download the same patch.

 I'll start with my favorite, my health still drops after zoning!!

Actually to say still would be wrong as it was not happening before 13.2, so when I read in the build notes that they had fixed the problem, I was confused as I had not had it happen since 12.9 .

Also noticed a new thing(for me) once in a while the sound of my running a nano program keeps going after it's done, and all the zoning in the world wont stop it, just logging seems to work. Very annoying!

Now if they could only get rid of those annoying people who train Meds into your group for fun. Don't get me wrong if you are running for your life that's another story. But to stand there, wait for the group to pull a Med or Two. Pull 2 or 3 yourself (or more) and run it thru the other group. Hmm... actually sounds like fun if you want to get a bounty on your head =) or become part of a KOS list or perhaps you prefer the title of being the top... well you know =)

I suspect that Whartorn Valley is included in Clan Startup maps.

But when I zone north into the valley itself, my mini map disappears.

Yeah, this does seem rather ridiculous.  Given how many other things stay "operative" despite dropping below requirements after equipping, making vehicles an exception is silly.  It actually makes sense that once you're in the vehicle, you get to use it regardless of what changes while you're in it.

Considering the rather large number of problems which appear to be directly associated with this vehicle req. checking, is there really any compelling argument not to just disable all the vehicle/flight zone req checking?  Disabling it would magically make all these zoning problems/bugs disappear (or should make them disappear, given what FC's said is the cause).

Is there really such a seriously exploitable case if players are allowed to remain in vehicles/flight/etc. after zoning if they no longer meet the requirements??  

Is catching that exploit case worth the substantial amount of grief it's causing to all the law-abiding vehicle-using players??

It certainly doesn't seem like the checks (to catch a few) are worth the problems they are causing (for all).

Bauxite @ 12/6/2001 5:15:47 AM (2446):
It is NOT a reload thing, I have two computers and two accounts, and the other computer sees the first continue shooting a dead corpse.

In FACT, it will continue shooting this same dead corpse even while another monster beats the crap out of them. It CAN get you killed while not fighting back.

If you do nothing, it tends to "correct" itself in 30-60 seconds, but thats ages versus some pissed off mean red thing, especially if it would only need a little extra damage to die faster while your group tries to blow it away.

Amazing how many bugs you can notice with two monitors side-by-side. For example, there are NO THIN SOLITUS FEMALES. You can choose thin, solitus and female, but guess what? Everyone else sees you as a regular solitus female on their screen. Didn't bother to check males, but whens the last time you saw a thing sol male eh?  Fat cannot be hidden however.

I have looked at every map in the shop. The aegean map contains a map of omni-1 hq and so does the clan startup maps so I suspect the wartorn map has been substituted with the omni map. It is certainly a bug.

This happens with Burst and Full-Auto as well, so it looks like it effects all specials. VERY annoying and has killed me quite a few times.

Spetnov @ 12/6/2001 1:51:39 PM (ATTACKED by NONE bug still in the game . 3178):
As a  'puller'  I often get too many mobs on a pull . ( game fog , weird aggro etc ) Subsequently I will try run the mobs off  but as from a while ago you will encounter a HUGE problem with this .

You will get the attacked by <NONE> message which was usually a sign of safety . What happens now the mobs damage will stack until it reaches you and deal this damage in one blow. 

Even without a text message of any damage you can just drop dead at the spot. It happens in missions and in the open field to any mob. This was probably created when they tried to fix mob's missions pathing . 

Please review this situation as it is very annoying and makes any strategy impossible.

Wudang @ 12/6/2001 2:30:25 PM (Paid beta gaming 3181):
Even though the game's good, the graphics are excellent and some things are quite well thought out, the game never left beta! I really feel we're playing a paid beta here, paying to test so to speak.

I've played many mmrpgs, but not with so many bugs as this one! And they just keep coming, a lot of features are disabled (mission creation, team missioning, etc) and a lot of other features just don't work properly. Recently, I keep dying when zoning for no apparent reason, which is extremely irritating, as well as my run speed goes up to 1300 when in missions?! Not to mention the list of already known (and acknowledged!) bugs. Not even AC was this bad!

Critters that attack you from rooms away, if you flee from a room they "teleport" back in front of you, attacks that don't work properly, health dropping down, statistics that go balistic, these are the main fundamentals of the game, and if they don't work properly, then surely this is still a BETA for which we shouldn't pay?!

I'm not a high level whiner, I quite happily play with a few bugs here and there, but surely this is taking the piss?

Aldo @ 12/6/2001 2:55:07 PM (My Atrox still drops plane after zone 3187):
And it is still as annoying.

I have noticed one thing.  I have a lvl95 Atrox enforcer, and a lvl 64 Opifex fixer.  

My Atrox, every time he zones his plane drops.   But not so for my fixer.  (my fixer found a plane in a chest, thank God, didnt want to do what I did with my enforcer to get one)  

Anyway, my friend has a lvl 55 atrox enforcer, who has a car, and everytime he zones too, his car deequips.  Is this just a bug with atrox?

Just wondering, because I thought this was fixed.

As far as I know, this is only (mostly) an optical bug. Watch your chat window, if possible. After you pressed your special-key, it will be fired, but due to lack of server synchronization (that's what I heard) the symbols in the task bar are not deactivated properly. After refresh time, in the chat window the message appears 'xxx' is available. Now fire again.

Happens quite often these days, especially when message spam occurs (team/group fights).

So long,

...when you get this bug, sometimes it will clear up by simply hitting it again...

othertimes it will simply freeze out your special attacks until that mob is killed...

i haven't died because of this bug, yet...but i have gone some battles with just using my regular pistol attacks with no fling or burst....it can get very scary at times.

Programmer, "hm...i think i'll take out the 'take it easy' bug and replace it with the 'please wait for your previous attack to complete' bug...that will be cool!"

Virindi @ 12/6/2001 4:02:52 PM (Enforcer Kills Green NPC in Lush Fields Mission 3197):
<< NEWSFLASH >> An Enforcer has managed to kill a green NPC during a mission in Lush Fields.  Joe "Leviathan" Briggs, a level 112 Clanner from Newland said he was "amazed and elated" by the unexpected feat, despite suggestions from Funcom that it must have been a sucker punch which caused the death of the green Seasoned BotHacker.
Joe said, "I normally get killed by greys in missions, so this is a personal best for me.   I was hitting him for minimum damage and he was healing himself faster than I could attack, but after running out of the mission area 47 times, I finally nailed him in the 48th with a 300 burst from my QL190 Novaflow"
Funcom at first refused to comment, although inside sources predict that they will now patch the game to prevent any further exploitation of their combat system. 
A Funcom employee who refused to give his name told me, "Management will go crazy if they get to hear about this.  It's supposed to be impossible to solo green NPC's.  I'm pretty sure they will patch this.  Players aren't supposed to have fun, you know."
Meanwhile, at his Newland home, Joe was proudly displaying the QL23 nanocluster of Swimming dropped by his victim, and has vowed to try killing a yellow npc next if he can assemble a large enough army.

Maxx,

This is more than a visual bug. When this occurs one or more specials simply are not available. I don't use the buttons provided by the game for these specials, I just use the hotkeys. Unfortunately, the specials are not actually becoming available and I can tell the difference in a fight

ragingsyph1 @ 12/6/2001 6:02:42 PM (Is it just me or do damage rings not work either? 3215):
i have some the Rings of Power and have noticed that they dont seem to work. using 2 Rings of Power-Physics that each are supposed to add 4%(or 4 points, whichever its sposed to be) for a total of 8%(or 8 points) combined with a spell that does radiation or chemical damage with a minimum damage of 364, shouldn't the minimum damage be 393?(8% of 364=29.12,364+29=393) or if the rings are only supposed to add 4 points each, shouldn't the minimum damage be 372(364+8=372)? whenever i use those spells and get minumum damage it does not reflect the increase that should be given by the rings, are these broken items as well?

I'm neutral, and Aegan is not in the neutral startup maps, I got it from the general store. If this is a bug, it was introduced recently, since patch 13.2 or 13.0, I believe I got the map just before 13.0.

The health/nano bars are quite often inaccurate on the team display, especially right after my teammates come into view on the team display (because I've just gotten in range of them).  I have to cycle through each one (F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6) to make the bars display the proper values.  It doesn't *always* fail, but I'm not relying on it anymore.  I just /assist mobs for now.

Mdkman @ 12/6/2001 8:46:43 PM (Losing Yalmaha :( 3234):
Well i have too say that this games really sucks bad now... Well u will understand after reading wy i think that....

On thuesday evening at about 20.00-22.00 GMT there where many servercrashes atleast 3.... in that time this happend

In the btween these crashes i had too put my yalamaha in bag... did not have space too pick up items... well that was np.. well i played maybe for 10-15 min more... then  a another servercrash happend... i logged in and i had my BELT in the fast key position....(i allways have Yalmaha on '0' key) hmm... this sucks and i relogged again, that did not help either well i thougt that i had too zone or something.. well i couldent zone at all.. because i was in NO mans land... there where a end of map... well i had no other chance too Terminate myself and lose all XP... well after rezoning i went too reclaim terminal and get my items... i locked all bags and i had no yalamaha......

Well  i made a petition... and after 2 days a GM spoke whit me..... This is the most sad part of this story.......

Well i told him what happend and he would see if he could give yalmaha back... well after 5 min he says this.. (making long story short)

He tells me this......

We can see that u had 1 yalamaha before the crash and We can see that u did not have yalmaha after the crash.... BUT they cant see that i lost the Yalamaha.....??????

Well i told him that Yalmaha is NO DROP and it only can disapear in Crash or bug......

Well he says that he cant do anything about it... because they cant see that i lost the yalmaha.. ((((

Well im not stupid.... and in my ears it sounds like this

(The GM just told me that i might have been Exploiting or Duping the yalmaha and therefore cant get newone back...)

Well this is the sick part of AO REALLY sick!!! this game is soo Exploited and Duped that GM's have given up on honest people.... 

Sorry for my bad spelling 

Well thats it.... 

Does the game suck? well u now what i think

Zierow @ 12/6/2001 9:23:31 PM (2907):
I seem to remember reading a post about this bug...  

If I remember right, and i'm putting it lamely, that it's caused by visual effects being off.  When a mob is shown at a point but really isn't there.  Then when you commence the special attack it's often wasted because the mob really isn't there.   I could be wrong.   Also I noticed if you try using a special attack during reload you lose it as well.  This one i'm pretty sure of.

Zierow @ 12/6/2001 9:32:13 PM (2446):
I play both an Agent and Soldier as well... and both experience phantom fire.   

I can't really say it's a lag issue, because I really don't lag.  Hard to say it's a bug, because it's really never hindered me.  It's more like an extra effect that shouldn't be there 

The reason it throws me off because I've noticed a bug where when you reload now if you try using burst or fling you lose it with no damage applied.  And with the phantom fire, it's harder for me to notice when i'm reloading.

And I can't confirm that the phantom fire slows my reloading process either.  Both seem to reload at thier estimated times.

That's just my take on it.

I had the same thing happen to me, only less strange. I had my jet in my inventory, also hotkeyed on '0', logged off for the night. When I logged back the following day, it was gone and my hotkey was bare. Very odd. I petitioned also and got even less of a response than you did, basicly, "sorry, but we cannot return lost items at this time". =|  

Much like you, I was very upset and was thinking of quitting the game - I think at the time I stayed because I had good friends that convinced me too, hehe.  Well, months later, I have another jet ***knocks on wood*** and the game is more enjoyable to me now than ever before! Don't give up, the game *still* has great rewards, both in materials and in people! =)

When pressing "I", you look into your inventory (i.e. your pockets)
In your pockets, you can cram a ridiculous amount of backpacks in there, which you can open by right-clicking them. I carry 11 backpacks myself, little or no IP invested in adventuring. Only backpack I actually wear, is the pioneer backpack, because of the bonus I get. In certain cases, I find it useful. If tutoring worked, it would be evenmore useful. But I digress.

Reminds me a little of Diablo, where you wasn't strong enough to wear an armour, but you could easily carry lots of them with youin your inventory

Misophist @ 12/7/2001 3:54:03 AM (3187):
My opifex MA has a few sense and agility implants and this ups her air vehicle quite a bit, I imagine. Planes have playshift requirements and are not checking for implants, even implants that are specifically for air vehicle. So the plane is dropped every time I zone. 

So, it has nothing to do with your breed, but rather the implants you're wearing to boost the skill, intentionally or not. Int/Sense/Agi/Air Vehicle.

Cosmik @ 12/7/2001 4:27:42 AM (2410):
From the 13.4 patchnotes (if you already hadn't noticed):

When zoning to an indoor playfield with a vehicle equipped, it will no longer drop to your inventory, but be disabled. It will then be marked red in your wear view. When you enter an outdoor playfield again, it will automatically be enabled.

So there you go. The fix is on its way.

Misophist @ 12/7/2001 4:29:56 AM (3058):
I spoke to an ARK about this when the last patch went live. She said there had been many reports that this bug was indeed not fixed, passed the info. along to her supervisors, and I haven't seen a thing about it at all from Funcom. 

Well, because this annoys the hell out of me, I took some screen shots of the instances where I was hitting minimum damage.

This mob was yellow: http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit...27/2360327.jpg

This mob was green -- any greener and he would have been gray: http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit...40/2360340.jpg

And lastly, this mob was yellow: http://faceweb-004.facelink.com/edit...62/2360362.jpg

All I want to know is this: should I get used to hitting for this über amount? In other words, is this intended?  Let me also add that I hit normally around 100-250, my brawls are 600+.

Dat's cool. But... I always un-equip my vehicle no matter where I zone because the playshift thingie doesn't take my sense/agi implants into account. Was something mentioned about this? Sorry if I missed it.

I don't see anyone here complaining about their vehicles not re-equipping when they leave indoor playfields.  In fact, I don't recall seeing ANYONE complaining about their vehicles not re-equipping when they leave indoor playfields.  Was that really considered more important than fixing the 'outdoor playfield zoning causes vehicle to de-equip' bug?

I DO see lots and lots of people (myself included) seeing their vehicles de-equip each time they zone from one outdoor playfield to another.  I suspect we outnumber the people complaining about 'vehicle de-equips when entering indoor playfield' by quite a bit
	
		
			
			
				So there you go. The fix is on its way. 
			
		
	
The "fix" described doesn't seem to address the bug most people are complaining about.  

Any word on a fix for the problem mentioned in this thread (and a couple of others), namely vehicles de-equipping when the player crosses between OUTDOOR playfields?

MrWaddles @ 12/7/2001 6:11:53 AM (PLEASE fix ring/bracer descriptions (or fix the items)! 3284):
Last I recall, Cosmik or Cz had verified that rings/bracers were only supposed to add their value in points of damage, not in percentage as the descriptions stated.

So...

Can somebody PLEASE fix the descriptions of these items to make it clear they only add _points_ not a percentage to damage?  It would appear that changing an item's description should NOT be a particularly complicated, or side-effect-inducing change, and it would stop some particularly bad deception that's occurring in how people are selling these items to other players.

I saw someone bidding 3M for an 11% Power-Melee ring, and it turned out NOBODY in the auction realized the ring added 11pts -- they all believed it added 11 percent (except for the seller, I'm pretty sure he knew EXACTLY what the ring's capabilities were). It's simply a situation where the bugged descriptions are NOT a "generally known fact".

P.S. If, contrary to what I (and others) read from a Funcom rep on the boards, the rings ARE supposed to add a percentage to dmg:  Is there any chance that will be fixed in the next five or six patches?  It's been broken dang near forever, along with everything else which related to modifying dmg by "percentage" in-game.

MrWaddles @ 12/7/2001 6:34:03 AM (3234):
Funcom, when items disappear during periods of server instability, it's rarely due to player duping/exploits.  You know perfectly well the crash/database problems are usually responsible for losses.  It's time to be honorable, admit mistakes, and take some accountability (by giving items like planes/cars/etc, which otherwise couldn't disappear for 99%+ of the players, back to the players who lost them).

LESS THAN 1% (if that) of your customers ACTIVELY attempt to dupe/exploit in manners that would cause those kinds of disappearances.  Yet you're treating EVERYONE as if they were.

If a person reports a loss of a NODROP item, such as a Yalm, then in the VAST MAJORITY of cases it's buggy server software or server hardware instability caused it.  Return the item to them.  Only if they are FREQUENTLY reporting such losses (and you KNOW there weren't associatedly frequent server/database problems) is it fair to start accusing people of exploiting/duping items.

It's bad enough already that we have to deal with the ridiculous NODROP restriction preventing resale of vehicles, this kind of treatment just goes over the line in terms of treating customers poorly.

Every time GMs say "We can't, you might have been duping/exploiting", they are accusing a paying customer of cheating, and punishing them for cheating, without any chance to appeal or question the decision or punishment..

That doesn't really seem like a good approach to attracting and keeping players, particularly ones who just lost items which required LOTS of effort to afford in the first place.

Edited because initial post seemed a bit too harsh on reread.

I had some fighting yesterday (as everyday) and checked for the effect again. Megaram, Meka and all the others are 'right'. It is more than a visual effect.
Sometimes it just doesn't show when the specials are gone off, but sometimes they are simply blocked. Well trying to fight without my Fling is not that decisive, but my Burst does contribute to my damage output (well, sometimes)!

Somebody else got an official statement or comment on this, like 'We are aware of that and working on it'?

Ok, my greatest dream in AO finally came true when one of my chars found a ql 32 Yalmaha in a mission chest )  This was prior to the 13.0 patch.  My flying skills were way too low at the time, so I only tried flying after 13.2, with my ql 90 flying implants installed... and it was everything I hoped it to be, and then some!

*Except*  The damn thing de-equips when zoning, and the button disappears from the shortcut bar   I've already died twice by getting aggrod when zoning like this (Upper East Stret) and I can tell ya, it suxxors.  My Kokaik behaves like it should.

I remember reading the patch info lately that Yalms would no longer de-equip like this, I guess that's not entirely correct.  Anyone else having the same problem?

I reported this by e-mail and using the in-game bug-report, but 4 days have passed now without any feedback from customer support...

Bothead @ 12/7/2001 10:07:26 AM (3187):
I have exactly the same problem on my nanomage Fixer, so it's nothing to do with breed/class.

If what Misophist says is true, that flying implants arent checked when zoning, they are worthless (bright and shining ql 90) along with the other clusters I installed in them   That's a bug Funcom need to fix, what would be the point of Flying implants if they're not checked?  Bah, I used all my IP on nano skills, cannot up flying without leveling again.

Vehicle skill implants are not at all worthless, without them you could not equip the vehicle in the first place. However, it is a bug when they are not added in zone-checking, but it is only a 'frustration-bug'  you'll have to re-equip every time you zone (as I have to do).

Buffs have a timelimitt for a reason!! If they were ment to stay on for ever they would'nt have a time limit, that sounds logical right?

2)
I would not complain about OvEqu. if everyone could benefit from it, but not everyone can, like most casters!

3)
FC are the desiners of the game and they agree that Ov.Equ. is cheating....

4)
The way it is now casters that cant over Ov.Equ. are useless!

5)
Did I hear someone say anything about NT do more damage? That would have been true if there werent Over.Equ. I pvpd a green character ones, he shot me 2 times and I was dead! My best nano that does allmost 600 dmg and 9 seconds to fier(there is allso a big chance of it not working at all) narely scratched him!
Thats what Im talking about when I say cheating, you cant say that that is fair!

6)
When FC fixes the Overeq. "bug" the people who use it will seriously feel it(I know they will fix it soon)

7)
Every class should have strongs and weaknesses! NT do lots of damage, but have realy litle hp... I dont know about the other profs.

8)
I say this again, you people dont seem to understand it anyway... Buffs have a time limit for a reason! THEY HAVE A TIME LIMIT!!! 

9) If casters that are fully dependant on nano formulas were able to overequip they would use upp all the nanopool in 1 single shott that would probobly take 10 seconds to fier(we would alreddy be dead by then)

I could go on and on, but it would get realy boring...

Ulakai @ 12/7/2001 1:02:05 PM (Missions and Mobs still Broken 3308):
I thought the last patch was ment to  sort out the mobs in missions, but it hasn't.

Im a 62 AD with q77-85 armour and q 78 Riders, Not amazing but still above my level - and I struggle to solo human mob greens, they still chain heal, i hit for minimum damage - its taking me hours to complete default missions if i get a yellow or orange in one i have to run back to the entrance and keep zone fighting them, taking 10 - 20 minutes a fight. Now i like a challenge but im sorry this is going too far now. I wouldn't mind so much if the missions paid more than a measly 17k - for taking 2 - 3 hours to do a mission i would expect at least 100k - the only way it seems to make money now is on completing a mission is to go and spam the shopping chans with the items you find, so i can waste a whole evenings gaming trying to complete a mission then selling the items. FROM 1 MISSION!!! - and because of this i daren't go hunting to level because missions will get much harder and i wont be able to afford new weapons and armour.

PLEASE SORT THIS OUT FUNCOM GAMING IS MEANT TO BE FUN NOT A CHORE!!!!!!

ZenBeck @ 12/7/2001 2:19:48 PM (3308):
I spent the last 4 weeks farming gray mobs solo in the wild trying to scrape up every credit I could muster. I was finally able to get a QL94 NovaFlow to replace the QL 56 I have had since I was lvl 55. Im now 64. I then needed implants up the ying yang to equip it and with a little help I was able to do so.

My gun is now 30 lvl's above my own. A necessity for any one thinking about 50% missions.

Last night I sit at the mission booth looking for a mission that will give me that secondary weapon, needed for the "big hits" to take out a yellow or orange mob. For the Soldier, Nova Flow for a primary and a Flashpoint is a must. 

After spending 1984 credits...look at this! A lvl 64 Flash point as a mission reward. SWEET! It pays 17k and is only 3 zones away. Not great cash but hey...Ill take it.

Lots of greens at first then yellows. That what I expect in a 50% mission. Then I find the yellow Claw that just dosent seem to notice I have a 1600 armor class. "WACK-WACK" 153-153 "WACK-WACK" 153-153. Hes hittin fast and hard. Ill get to the point.

It took me 2 hours and 45 minutes. 94 QL50 treatment packs. 112 first aid stims and I lost count or ammo spent. I finally beat this uber mob down..."GREAT" He yields 400 some credits and no loot. 

Oh...I didnt mention that I can no longer open locked chests and doors? Thats right, I tried 50-100 times on the 5 locked chests I found. No go. Nice...being that I never had to put points into the skill now required to open them...Ill never have the ip to at this point. Oh, sorry...back to the point.

After all this I find the mission item, by passing some of the mobs due to the fact I am out of first aid packs and treatments. I pick it up...the mission completes. I even got a token. COOL! Wait...what the heck...  NO FLASHPOINT. I have the room in my inventory...what the...   it was a "find the" mission and there is the adventurer nano in my inv. and I got the cash and the token but... "NO FLASHPOINT FOR YOU!" 

To sum it up...all the time and supply’s I used just to get the item I worked so hard for never showed up. Disappointed....thats an understatement. 

Summation:

1. In order to do 50% missions you NEED to over equip by 30 or so lvls.

2. Even over equipped in armor and weapons you will still find that "uber" mob that either disregards your AC or has an AC of his own that can only be defined as an exploit.

3. Dont count on getting an item form a mission. Camping the booth for what you want might just p!ss you off.

Sorry so long...thanks for reading my vent.

Nanogater,
I depend heavily on my plane NOT de-euipping when I zone.  I cannot tell you how many times I have zoned into Upper East Stret or harder zone and get insta-aggroed and killed within 10 seconds, all because of this silly and unnecessary bug.  Frustrating? Yes, I give you that, but that's not the point.  Point is I die, losing valuable time and XP, nevermind the effort of customizing my expensive implants in which I could gave used different clusters than Flying.

How would you like if your armor de-equipped into your inventory whenever you zoned?  Damn nuisance, right?  Thought so 

Funcom:  I've reported this bug twice (e-mail and feedback form), but haven't heard anything from customer support. Not the best way of handling my frustration, Funcom... a simple confirmation and thanks for reporting a bug is all it takes.

I have noticed one thing.  I have a lvl95 Atrox enforcer, and a lvl 64 Opifex fixer.  

My Atrox, every time he zones his plane drops.   But not so for my fixer.  (my fixer found a plane in a chest, thank God, didnt want to do what I did with my enforcer to get one)  

Anyway, my friend has a lvl 55 atrox enforcer, who has a car, and everytime he zones too, his car deequips.  Is this just a bug with atrox?

Just wondering, because I thought this was fixed. 
			
		
	
Same problem for me as well...

Misophist @ 12/7/2001 5:54:35 PM (3187):
The fact that I have to re-equip is bad because: if I zone into 25% or a mayhem zone, I have to get over latency (5-10 seconds or more, depending on how many people are around), equip my plane (10 seconds) and do it all before my 15 seconds of invulnerability runs out. Which is quite impossible. 

It'd be much easier if I could just zoom away after I got over the latency, rather than wait around while I'm open to attack. I know this was the way of things before the patch, but gah, it IS frustrating to see people zoning with their plane while I absolutely cannot because of sense and agility implants.

Misophist @ 12/7/2001 6:38:28 PM (3058):
I'd love Cosmik or anybody to take a look at those screenshots I posted. There are a few things to take note of:

- The mobs in question don't always have damage shields.

- The mobs that have this high AC or whatever are not limited to "fighting" NPCS such as enforcers or soldiers, because I've run into this problem when fighting MPs and traders (as you can see in my screenshot w/ the swindler).

- A meta skill debuff or a deprive/ransack skills from a trader drastically decreases the min damage I'm hitting for, thus making it even more difficult to survive fights against some MOBs.  You can see that I'm hitting the trader for an incredibly low amount, and he was green. That's because he cast deprive and ransack skills. 

- This problem is most noticable for people who use light/fast damage weapons, such as fists, some melee/MA weapons and Maussers, Novas, etc. A person using a hammer will not notice this so drastically, nor will a pet-profession (I'm thinking engineer) be affected badly because their pet has a high min. damage. 

- All mobs hit us for their maximum minimum damage, all the time, every time, no matter how high our AC is. Meanwhile, I can't really call the damage I'm dealing truly "minimum", because it changes depending on the mob I'm fighting. It hovers somewhere between 50-70 post 13.2. 

- The non-human mobs, with low AC, have more hitpoints than human NPCs (seems that way), yet I'm hitting them for 100-250 on normal hits, which makes the fights go so much faster. They hit me harder compared to human MOBs, but again -- they don't last as long because I can deal a normal and satisfying amount of damage in return.

- Since human mobs are such a pain, I do chaos missions which result in 50% - 100% non-human enemies in 2 out of 3 missions, and they're much easier than the painful and lengthy process of killing ALL human mobs. Yet I don't want to be stuck with these mission slider settings for the rest of my MAs AO career. Generally, the better mission items go along with bad/order/money, which yield all human mobs, and that equals a nightmare for me. 

Anyway, those are all the important points I can think of for now. It'd be nice if this could be addressed. People don't seem as vocal about it, so maybe success of the last patch varied, but for me, the "bug" is still alive and kicking.

Mustafo @ 12/7/2001 9:19:38 PM (3178):
yes it happened to me 3 times last night very very annoying.  Not seeing any damage and then poof your dead.


It does seem to be related to distance, if you get out of range and then it follows you back into range.

Mustafo @ 12/7/2001 9:41:51 PM (943):
saw these bugs last night


Hit atrox soldier NPC for less than minimum damage using compressed shockwave.

Phantom death where no damage is shown, but you are being hit.
This seems to be related to getting out of the range of something that is attacking you and then back in.

MOBs warping to you.  I had this happen at least 4 or 5 times last night where I would be running along outside and stop then poof the thing I had been outrunning is now running at me from in front(not behind) and attacking me.

MOB levels still not fixed in missions mobs ranged from orange to grey in 1 mission all grey in the next and nearly all green in a third.  better but far from fixed

double hits by mobs.  This does not happen consistently but for some reason some mobs are getting two for the price of one.

Scorus @ 12/7/2001 9:45:42 PM (Another sudden death 3367):
Okay, so I'm walking through the mission, minding my own business. My healing pet is centered directly on me, my attack pet is following. I walk into a room with full Health, a green shoots me for ca. 30 and I keel over dead.

This has happened before. When it was reported I was told that I had been taking damage from a mob and it just wasn't reported. I very much doubted that explanation because I am very methodical in my mission clearing and there were no mobs except the one that I had just started fighting. This time there was a healing pet that would have been healing me had I been taking damage. On at least one of the previous occassions my pet was guarding me and should have engaged the stealth mob (unless it is also invisible to the server).

It always happens on the first shot from a new target and it always happens when I am at full health. This time I lost 20K XP. The only reason I'm not REALLY upset is that I had already recovered the mission-only nanocrystal that was my main reason for being there.

Breaku @ 12/8/2001 12:13:56 AM (- TEAMing for IC or ESSENCE 3381):
Sometimes i team up with a doc or enforcer to get a ic or a hp 

Then when i leave the team... although im already out of it .... it still seems to think im in it.

let me clarify....

after i leave the team... all of a sudden it says.... "nano program succesffully completed" ... and im healed. by who? by the doc that game me ic.

Once i asked for a hp buff from a doc... let the team... 2 secs later i get IC on me... i asked him waht the?.... and he says "oh" i just casted on someone else.  Wierd.... i have to log out to get out of the team.

It frustrates me the most when u do this... and then u go fight in pvp.... someone in your range and it says u can't attack the person because someone is higher or lower in level. And i know its cause im bugged.

Anyone else know what im talking about? Is there a ETA fix for this?

Another is... bezerk rage.... if u zone with this still on, you will zone on the other side with a (-) negative run speed. You have to zone again to unbug it... 

These aren't MAJOR bugs.... and CAN be avoided... but just thought i'd throw it in incase the dev team was bored.

Bruteon @ 12/8/2001 1:42:06 AM (Battlesuits 3389):
ok, almost nobody uses battlesuits because of the following

1) 200% nano cost increase
2) weapons do not show on hands
3) attack damage occur in spurts/become inconsistent

1. this is fine. unfortunately with the implementation of professions, EVERY Profession is reliant on nanos. I expected at least one or two that could not use nanos, but i was wrong. Every profession requires nanos to play. nanos do not just act as a slight boost to ability/effectiveness, THEY DEFINE THE PROFESSION!!!! even weapon based professions (enforcer, soldier) are defined by their profession specific Nanos <---- fundamental flaw in the "loose" malleability of characters. (but i like the nano penalty... kinda went off topic)


2. This is a problem. so i switched weapons, but i'm  not sure i switched... so i end up having to look through my character sheet to figure out what weapon i'm using.... beside the fact that i look like i'm swinging my bare fists, even tho they're really dual weapons.

3. attacks seem to stack up, and then suddenly pop. for any weapons, dual or single, 2 rounds of attacks will be crammed into one, followed by a long pause. for dual weapons, 2+2 attacks, roughly 4 attacks at the same time, and 2 for single weapons. Although the damage over time is the same, this is buggy because i dont know how much damage i'm doing most of the time. then wam.
 

i just want to see more people in battlesuits. but as is, since all professions are reliant on "on the fly" nanos (stuff executed during combat)... battlesuits and tank armor are a thing of the past ;(


funny, i just gave away 4 nano cloaks to my guild. and had an entire hunting group (doc, soldier, crat, nt, ma, enf) all clad in nano armor. my nt will now wear a string bikini to distinguish himself.

Aenear @ 12/8/2001 1:45:16 AM (vehicle bug: not possible to unequip (after being attacked) 3390):
There seem to be actually two bugs with the vehicles: 

* First bug: When attacked I suddenly can no longer unequip my vehicle. This does not happen all but most of the time - and it is not even possible to unequip the vehicle when the attack stopped. 

I have to zone using the second bug to get rid of the vehicle or I can zone inside a building - both methods might not work anymore after the next patch, so this first bug might become a gamestopper for me.

* Second bug: I use implants to raise my vehicle ground skill to the necessary level - and everytime I zone the vehicle unequips. This seems to be the same problem which was solved in the 13.2 patch for secondary weapons: 

Fixed a bug that caused secondary weapons to unequip when switching playfields. Basically, when re-building the character after zoning, weapons were checked before implants were, thus when trying to place the weapon, the implants would not be taken into consideration and you would not meet the requirements.

Breaku @ 12/8/2001 2:23:02 AM (3389):
not only that .. but u cant morph, can't use your jet, car etc.

Cant put on other armor.... at least they fixed it so that u can weaer your merit board. cant fit through doors in missions.

it shouldn't be called a battle suit ... it should be called PVP suit. Cause there is no other reason your gonna wear it. If your doing missions with it... then your gonna have a hard time.

I use to think they looked cool... but now i just think they're plain stupid.

Neryn @ 12/8/2001 3:54:09 AM (3058):
Nice screenshots Misophist!

At least you were out-damaging the mob. I have this same problem with my lvl 35 agent, except oftentimes its a losing battle. Just recently in a 50% mission, I ran into an yellow/orange mob who was sporting one of those über damage shields. The fight went a bit like this.

You hit über Mob for 21 points of projectile damage.
über Mob's damage shield hits you for 18 points of damage.
You hit über Mob for 21 points of projectile damage.
über Mob's damage shield hits you for 18 points of damage.
über Mob hits you for 45 points of projectile damage.
You hit über Mob for 21 points of projectile damage.
über Mob's damage shield hits you for 18 points of damage.
You hit über Mob for 21 points of projectile damage.
über Mob's damage shield hits you for 18 points of damage.
über Mob hits you for 38 points of projectile damage.
....and on and on until I have to run for my life with the mob still at 3/4 health.

As you can see, I was only gaining three points damage on the mob versus what he was reflecting via the shield, and the mob was getting in decent hits besides. 

First aids were a waste of time and only prolonged the inevitable. 

My agent would normally do anywhere from 30-120 points of damage per hit with his ql 49 grippo, and occasionaly get 300-400 crits in as well. Not with these obviously bugged mobs. 

In fights against yellows and greens I only fair somewhat better, simply insert me doing say 30-35 points per hit damage, instead of the 21, in the above scenario and its about the same raw deal.

If I think of it next time I encounter one of these, I will be sure to grab some screenshots too.

Neryn @ 12/8/2001 4:28:55 AM (3178):
Yes, it does seem to be very much related to range. I have had this happen to me out in the wild when hunting too, and have posted about it before.

I play an agent, and thus often use aimed shot to initiate combat. Every once in awhile, I fire off aimed shot and the mob takes off in the other direction for awhile, instead of coming straight for me. If they run out of range, and come back in, the fight will proceed with neither me nor the mob appearing to take any damage. That is to say, it appears neither of us are taking damage until one or the other falls over dead, seemingly out of the blue, according to our health bars. 

Now, the interesting part is, assuming I was the one that lived in the previous bugged battle, is that the next mob I fight, the very first shot I do to it, I get a whole screen of spam that I hit (the new mob) for line after line of damage. It seems the damage reports from the previous fight are now taking effect, but now are applied on the new mob. Sometimes the mob shows he is dead, according to his health bar, from all that old damage being applied to him, but I still have to keep hitting him until his real hp’s are drained away. This tells me there is at least two counters going on for health, as the phantom damage obviously didn’t effect the mobs actual health, only his health-bar and the damage reports.

This in itself wouldn’t be so bad, but my health bar is bugged from the previous fight too. As soon as the new mob hits me, say for 35 damage, my health bar finally updates and I can go from what appeared to be full health, to almost dead. On a couple of occasions, the first hit did kill me, thus the insta-death phenomena.

I have learned after a few untimely deaths, that if it appears you are not taking damage from a mob during an extended fight, cast a heal spell, or do a first aid on yourself anyway, as this will reflect what your true health is. At least this way, you can tell if your about to die or not and possibly have a chance to walk away.

Whatever the causes, this should be addressed and should be a top priority. Every single game based upon dealing and receiving damage needs some system of recording and displaying that damage so the player, in real time, knows if he should continue the battle or make a run for it. This is the very essence a game like this, and it is futile to play without it working correctly, 100% of the time. It may not keep your client from starting and logging in to the server, but I, as I am sure many others do, consider it a Game Stopping bug. If you have no idea what your current health is, or that of your foes, in battle, how can you possibly call that a working game??

Neryn @ 12/8/2001 4:40:15 AM (2549):
Yeah, I have noticed this too. My token board and implants only add a small amout of hp's to my total, so its not life or death for me, but it is damn annoying.

TemplarRed @ 12/8/2001 4:48:39 AM (1951):
Here we go again... one would almost believe that many of these people calling for nerfs are players who truely feel the opposite of what they say, & they're just trying to discredit the 'nerf over-equipping' arguement by sounding foolish.

'Fragile' being the key word, here.
Extremely fragile, in the case of equipment & the use thereof.  This game would suggest that a battered, rusty, second-hand, flea-bitten, pox-ridden, unwashed, & all-around-plain-yucky firearm (just one example) if easier to use than a brand new one in perfect condition?  
Hobbes, I loved the example that you had cited, also, lol!
Reality?  Umm, no.
Not that I have any problem with this system.  I like it as it is.  It makes a certain level of 'twinkage' difficult, but not impossible.  This system was not put into place to make anythig more realistic, & that's fine.

Today I got a bunch of new implants, buffed MA up real high, and put on a new set of fists that were way above my QL. Now when I lose the buffs, the fists will stay equipped and I will be able to do much more damage..... /sigh Not everyone can benefit from being able to buff into a weapon and then still use it when your sklills drop back to normal. This is why OE is flawed. It puts certain classes at a greater advantage over others. MAs are supposed to do the most damage over time, but what good is that if in pvm you only hit for minimum damage, and in pvp you dont stand a chance against rooters and over equppied agents, soldiers and enforcers who can drop you in seconds.
			
		
	
Oh, come on now... MA's are perfectly capable of stretching their limits with the armor & implants use (just like everyone else).  Besides, MA's rock, just as they are right now.  A well-equipped MA is just as useful an addition to a team as any well-equipped Agent or whatever.  And there have been quite a few MA's going about with PvP titles lately.  Plus, you don't need to shell out millions of credits for ammo & weapon upgrades!
I won't deny that roots are the Achilles' heel of MA's.  This is game design, not a 'flaw'.  Different tactics work better against different professions; nano skill debuffs are more effective against NT's & Docs, but far less effective vs. pet users, for example.
I team with a number of MA's regularly, & they are absolutely killer.  If your MA isn't up to par, I'd take a closer look at how you're building him, or how you're equipping him.  And if you get rooted often, I'd advise increasing nano-resist.

Wrong again.  Since the base ability implant/clusters sometimes overlap with the nano-skill implant/clusters, many NT's (among other professions) have two sets of implants:  One for equipping armor (the base ability set) & one for general use (the nano-skill set).  Use the treatment machine, a med suit, & a Doc buff to outfit the strongest implants, & use essence, iron circle, feline grace, etc. to help with the armor.
Also... for whatever reason do NT's run about with those pillows?

Thats what Im talking about when I say cheating, you cant say that that is fair!
			
		
	
I can say this is fair.  There are NT's running about with PvP titles.  Therefore, it is possible for an NT to excel at PvP.  In fact, I see characters of every profession with PvP titles.  Docs might be the rarest, but I still see them.  If you want your character to excel at PvP, then you should try approaching someone of your profession who has a title, & see what they're doing that you're not doing.

Yes, you're right.  The time limit is how long you have to equip that high-ql gear.  Or whip up that super-pet. 

As a Trader, I don't use wrangler buffs exclusively for weapon equipping.  I've wrangled Engies so they can make bigger bots.  I've wrangled MA's so they can run a muscle booster buff (or whatever variant), & then in turn, equip better armor.  The list goes on & on.
  
My point?  Weapon-users aren't the only people who continue to benefit from temporary buffs after they wear off.  Additionally, every profession depends on their nano-programs, both in PvP & PvM.  Every profession is a 'caster', to some extent.  All is fair.  Not perfectly balanced (perfect balance won't ever exist unless all the professions were exactly alike).  Just fair.  Or fair enough, at least.

Looks like all it did was guarentee Funcom $90 bucks of my money ($30 for game + $60 for 6-month subscription) for their "Beta" product.

The reason missions are sooooo difficult now is because fc had to make all the mobs stronger due too all the over equiping that was happening. Beafor the patch i was able to solo 70-80% missions... now im lucky if i can get through a 50%. They pay nothing now to boot so its incredibly difficult to make enough money to over equip like you have to to actually be any good. If funcom had simply put in the no-over equiping patch as planned the missions would most likely be much easier now as they would undoubtly lower their toughness...  but nooooooo... we like having our lvl 200 guns at lvl 80.... so now everyone is hurt... funcom looks bad and i cant get enough money to buy a simple nano formula. i hope funcom grows a backbone and decides that implementing the no-overequiped weapons IS the best and only way to go!. it would make everything easier on everyone and the game balance would be superb... quit hiding behind your ql 200 gun and try to help funcom make a good game.

Hi there.

I just recently purchased a yalmaha and was all excited untill i pulled the mouse towards me to go up and realised my plane was tilting downward.

I checked my options and inverted mouse was ticked, and it does play inverted when not in the plane and in first person, but as soon as i get in my yalm it swaps.

I think it's kind of stupid that of all places when flying the mouse is not inverted. Whens the last time you pushed forward on a joystick to make a plane go up?


Anyone else out there find this highly annoying?

Would be great if someone from funcom could give me a response on this.

Cheers,
Consuelo.

The prob is that it still doesn't check the implants before the yalm when you zone...*fix* up your vehicle air to where you can still use it without implants. easy as that. my ql31 yalm requires 85 VA skill...don't tell me you can't afford that no matter how blue your VA skills is...

I personoly dont care about over equiping armour, everyone can do that so its more or less fair, but weapons, NT use nao formulas that check their skill everytime they are fierd!

starknaked @ 12/8/2001 10:52:39 PM (Camelot has basic stores? 3451):
Ok, so what's up with this?

Camelot, an outpost in Avalon, surrounded by level 80-100 mobs, has a basic medical store that sells quality 10 and 20 treatment kits and stims.

Why would anyone who comes to this outpost ever want to buy such low level junk?

If there's gonna be a medical store, it should be an advanced one, so players can actually buy stuff there which they can use.


And for that matter, why does it take like 450 comp lit to grid into avalon, when you can just whompa right in?  This makes no sense.  Anyone who has comp lit that high doesn't go to Avalon, they fight in other places.  Avalon is for level 50-90 or so players, who certainly don't have 450 comp lit.

I am a 93 NT and I too was quite bummed about the range nerf.  I use the 67% range increase instead of the 57% increase because it theoretically gives me an extra .75m...

Thats right baby....  feel the hurt on that 75cm...  (Thats about 29.5 inches to those in the US and the UK.)

At this point, I have my QL 200 Range increaser sitting in the bank just on the WAY off chance that FC resets the range boundry to something past the 41.75 meters or whatever I get with the 67%...

I would like to add that Melee range needs to be looked at for MOBs and for Players.  I have gone without the range buff and been hit by Melee combat while the Target is out of range for my nano.  

I am of the opinion that the 217% range increase that was originally possible was a bit gross, but I think that the 40m cap is also disgusting.  If I am fighting anything with a 40m rifle, how am I going to win???  I think that people that whined about the unfairness of the NT range were just too lazy to invest in things like nanoresistance.  I have a fixer, (level 64) who owns NTs cause his NR is maxed...  I guess no one has thought about how useless an NT is if all of the nanos he throws out gets resisted.

Shout back

Sorry, Cz, etc.  I'm just upset at these bugs that have been with us for 3 or more client patches.  I hate seeing new functionality added to the game when there are so many basic bugs that need attention.

You're not losing customers not only because you lack content - you're losing customers due to the bugs that don't get fixed.

starknaked @ 12/9/2001 4:53:10 AM (Sympathetic Shielding Barrier problems 3475):
While useful, this has got to be the most annoying nano in the game.  (Ok, there are a few others that are annoying in the same way)

Instead of just casting it once and having it add 150 or whatever to the armor class of everyone in your group, this nano apparently autocasts itself over and over again every 22 seconds.

Meaning that, first of all, your screen keeps getting spammed with this stupid nano casting and running out all the time.

Secondly, it constantly gets in the way of any other nanos you might want to be casting.

And I don't know how it works normally, but if you're an agent under false profession, it takes 10 seconds for this thing to cast.  What that means is that for 10 seconds out of every 22, you won't be able to cast other nanos because this thing is busy casting itself.

And I can't cancel it!  Once the bureaucrat or whoever it is in my group casts it, the stupid thing just keeps recasting every 22 seconds on me whether I like it or not.

Can this be fixed?  Either make it like a normal nano which lasts for 1/2 hour, or AT LEAST have thing thing only autocast every 5 minutes, instead of every 22 seconds.  Christ!

Crin @ 12/9/2001 5:04:05 AM (3411):
This is actually kinda funny.  When I first got my yalmaha I had the exact same problem but I was so happy to get it that that I flew it over Rubi-ka for a couple of days. Now when I play my character it feels weird.

Cyrian @ 12/9/2001 7:49:53 AM (3234):
I lost a kodiak as well.  Had it equipped, but it wouldn't let me unequip it.  So I took it out of HUD1 and put it in my inventory where it promptly disappeared.  I tried zoning and logging to no avail.    Also lost some equipment that I had just traded today when we both got kicked at the same time.

Zierow @ 12/9/2001 12:03:59 PM (Just wanted to report some bugs.... 3497):
I started a new agent today.  And here are a few bugs and issues I just wanted to throw at ya.

1.  Phantom Firing- Speaking as an agent, this is a real pain in the butt.  Having only 5 ammo at times it is constantly phantoming.  This is causing issues in a couple areas.  One being it seems to take longer to reload with the Phantoming.  2 If I try to use any special skill while it's phantoming, I loose that skill for that turn 100%.  And it's hard not too prevent that because of course it's fireing.  The only way to prevent is to keep track of your shots. *yeah right*

2.  Mob Regeneration - At early levels, Mobs regeneration is way out of control.  When I had the beginner weapon it was damn near impossible to kill anything.  At times it was regenerating faster in battle then I was killing it.

3.  Missions - At level 7, I'm starting to get missions taking me out to Stret West Bank.  And i'm doing simple missions that have always kept me close to home before.

4.  Petitions - Sometimes it can take up to 6 to 8 hours to get a petition answered.

5.  Battle Mode Stalling - A few times, right in the middle of battle, I just stopped attacking for no reason.  The mob on the other hand continued to attack, I had to re-engage the mob to attack again.

6.  Cave Missions - When you fall into the water.  It's a pain sometimes to get out of it.  Also Mob will get stuck in walls while attacking and they inflict double damage at a time.  Engaging Mobs in swim depth water is also a pain.

Some of these you may know.  Some you may not.  Others you may not care.   But there they are so far.

Zierow @ 12/9/2001 12:17:43 PM (Feedback on Over-Equiping.... 3498):
I was thinking..... With the state that AO is in, with the poor NPC balance, countless bugs, and min-damage issue.  It seems that anymore we are "forced" to over-equip just to play the game.

I never used to over-equip in the past, just didn't need to. Was happy with what I was doing.  But as things progressed it just led to the said problem.

I'm curious as to what others think.

starknaked @ 12/9/2001 12:39:18 PM (3498):
Well, yes.

As for armor, I hardly think it's any sort of a problem or that it should ever be changed.  I mean, whoopie, I overequipped and with the use of buffs I got armor 10 levels higher than I would have.  That means it adds 150 more in armor class than it would have.

So now instead of hitting me for 150-200, with criticals of 400,  mobs are hitting me for 135-185, with criticals of 385.  Wow, big difference.

The difficulty in getting out of water is unbelievable. I've had to go into 3rd person mode, jump, sit and do all sorts of acrobatics just to climb on to the ledge at the door.
It truly makes me leery of doing missions in caves, etc. We won't even mention the ramp over the slime one.

bizahh @ 12/9/2001 7:43:12 PM (Stuck in green swirly room! 3517):
After I took my first mission, I got trapped inside the mission's dungeon. There is a dead end room in the dungeon that has a strange dark green swirling stuff. It goes horizontally inside its own room with three doors leading into the room. I went inside the room to see what the green swirly was all about, and when I tried to leave the room, I couldn't. There was a kind of invisible wall blocking all the doors. So now I'm stuck in the first dungeon, and I've tried everything I can think of to somehow get out. Has anyone else had this problem? How can I fix it?

spydr @ 12/9/2001 7:59:10 PM (3517):
I don't think I've seen that kind of room...but I know how to get out!

/terminate

Thats the easiest way.  you'll have to deal with the loss of xp and whatnot, but hey, it's only 3 minutes out of your in-game life (rez sickness).

/petition

Thats the harder way.  just remember that it drops out of the queue after 4 hours.  good luck, soldier.

----

some other things you can try are walking backwards (it worked for me, once), jumping (both in-place and through the 'walls'), side-stepping, sneaking...  Basically, try other methods than just running staight at the invisible walls.

Zierow @ 12/9/2001 10:11:27 PM (3058):
I agree with Misophists last statement here.

MistressJade @ 12/9/2001 10:15:26 PM (3458):
Absolutely!

Do you need proof of this Funcom? Do you need someone to prove to you that you are losing customers for just this reason? 

Well here's your proof. I have been playing for 3 months. 

Today I was trying to run some mission, because everyone knows you have to for money. I kept getting jumped by these scooplets that I couldn't hit, couldn't target, and couldn't see. Hmm... Seems like this has been going on for quite a while. Too long for me.

Between that and all the other crap I have had to deal with with your game, I quit. I am done. No more money from me. You can take your game and stick it sideways Funcom. 

I am not your beta tester!

Oh, out of curiousity. How in the world do some of these bugs EVER make it past QA? You do have a QA department don't you?

Get a clue. And welcome to a free market economy. I hear DAoC is fun.

hobbes @ 12/9/2001 10:48:55 PM (Please read and fix 3524):
Gameplay bugs:

During mission, during normal appearing combat (brawl and fast attack work), I lose ability to heal, use parry or flurry of fists. Have to zone out of mission to reset. RepeatX3 different opponents.

One of these was my target, who aggroed me very early in mission. Got a token anyway, but he should not initiate combat, especially so close to front door.

The problem this presented was that I could not heal in mission and there were many more monsters remaining and I needed xp. Well, too bad, had to zone and lost mission.

In my car I used first aid, no problem. But after being attacked in car, I could not use first aid, could sit, but could not heal. Could not de-equip car. So I just headed home, losing health I could not replace, by each aggro (Avalon is not friendly).

Once inside Camelot, I could not save my game. With the tip of my car on insurance terminal it said I was too far away. "Sat" down, still in car and exited. Usually, it will initiate exit, then say "exit aborted", then you have to reset your computer to exit.

My thought on cars: click on in inventory= equip
                                 click on in HUD        =unequip

I think the change in equipping cars to avoid PvP "getaway vehicles" did more harm than good.

I have described BASIC gameplay that is still flawed. Before you add two prominent tail feathers to Reets and shorten their beaks by an inch, please make the game playable.

Khayne @ 12/9/2001 10:58:45 PM (Implant bug! 3529):
I recently put in an implant of Matter Creation and Nano Pool.

Seems the sdditional Nano Pool cluster did NOTHING!!? I tried removing it and re adding it, i tried zoning, but nothing happened to my nano pool.

This is clearly a bug. Could it be looked into?

godthe bugs!!!! @ 12/9/2001 11:00:15 PM (ok this is getting on my nerves 3530):
DAMMIT, ITS BAD ENOUGH SOME OF THE MISSIONS i GET, BUT THIS LAST ONE WAS THE LAST STRAW.  Ok, there are 3 enemies in the main room, fine noe problem, I can draw them out one at a time.  They heal superfast if I accidently get more on my ass and have to zone, thats fair.  WHAT SUCKS IS WHEN I COME BACK IN THEY ARE EITHER BACK IN THE MAIN ROOM WHERE I HAVE TO START ALL OVER AGAIN OR THEY ARE ALL IN THE FRONT ROOM WITH THERE INITS 4X AS FAST AS THEY WERE.  This makes missions undoable if you make even the slightest mistake and is very very annoying.  Why raise the init, what kind of **** is that?

Khayne @ 12/9/2001 11:08:27 PM (3517):
I was grouping with a friend of mine, and we vere doing fine. We came upon this room with 3 doors and something swirling just beyond the doors. My friend went through the doors and couldnt get out. He petitioned, but nothing happened for over 2 hours. In anger he quit.

This is a problem, and im careful when im in that room. I never go near those doors... There is nothing beyond them anyway so there is no point going there.

I sympathize though... Hate beeing stuck in graphics!!

was justfighting out doors and its not just when zoning, it appears it also happens when they break combat, oh joy.

Taldrin @ 12/10/2001 12:24:13 AM (Cyborgs... 3535):
I'm not sure if this is a bug at all but it needs to be looked at. Previously all human mobs were using 2 handed weapons and martial arts at the same time. This was declared as a bug and fixed, except for cyborgs it seems. I would not mind if they used 2 handed weapons and martial arts too because they are cyborgs, and are supposed to have superhuman abilities. The problem is that they are effectively doing two attacks at once, martial arts has it's own recharge timer, and so does the weapon. This leads to some insane damage rates from the borgs if you get close enough for them to use martial arts on you. A friend on mine in a team was killed by a corporal that spawned next to him, before the rest of us even turned around. Hit him like 6x in under 2 seconds.

I found one method which can consistently get me out of the water.

1) Jump
2) While in the air.. move in the direction of "land".

Important,.. for step (1), it's a vertical upward jump.. don't try to move and jump at the same time.

spydr @ 12/10/2001 3:58:31 AM (3458):
at first, it was omni mobs showing up in omni missions.  no biggie.  They didn't attack you (if you didn't attack them).

Then, due to exploits, they made it so that same-aligned mobs do not give you xp.  no biggie, they didn't attack you (if you didn't attack them).

Then, due to some incomprehensable reason, they made it so that all mobs aggro in mission (rather than just eliminating omni mobs from omni-missions).  Big biggie.  aggro means that we have to kill them.  no xp means we just wasted time (the biggest resource of all!).

BooYah!

Ulakai @ 12/10/2001 4:11:14 AM (3524):
All i can say is i get exactly the same problem when attacked in reet form (please can i have heals back too in reet form, please, begging now)

Ulakai @ 12/10/2001 4:23:27 AM (3411):
Perhaps we dont play inverted

Ashuras @ 12/10/2001 4:25:07 AM (3458):
I forgot to mention one thing.

If your objective is to get a token.... it might still be worth doing the mission even if they are filled with these bugged mobs.

I've found that they count towards getting a token.

The green ones are easy to kill and gives a decent amount of $$$. Plus I think they drop lots of NF instruction discs nowadays.

Misophist @ 12/10/2001 4:28:16 AM (3458):
If I encounter these buggers in missions, I delete the mission and return to my favorite Omni mission terminal for another go. Unless it's for a decent prize, of course.

I also delete a mission if it has too many human mobs in it. I use the --> chaos option in the mission slider, to encourage non-human mobs, but sometimes that doesn't work at all.

Much time is wasted when I arrive at a mission only to find I'll have to go through hell to complete it. Much easier to delete and try again. But this SHOULDN'T be the case.

spydr @ 12/10/2001 4:31:02 AM (3411):
also, by default, most full 3D games (flight sims, decent, ect) have inverted mouseing.

Misophist @ 12/10/2001 4:34:20 AM (3058):
Thanks for the support, Zierow. 

I had been rendered speechless by my frustration and anger.

Honestly, I really wish something could be said about this. Did they actually fix the problem or just tell us they did to make us shut up? Or is this FC's way of making the game even more difficult than it already is? 

Very uncharitable thoughts, I know, but Funcom has been silent about this obviously unchanged issue since the last big patch. And now I'm left with my own speculation. Never a good thing.

Bloodriegn @ 12/10/2001 7:27:25 AM (3535):
Ya i petitioned about this once about a week or so ago.  Your right that it was declared a bug before when NPC mobs both shot at you and punched ya.....but as you said the cyborgs do it now.

So maybe it can be clarified, is it a bug or 'as intended'

Thanks

megamet @ 12/10/2001 8:15:46 AM (3497):
I have noticed that pets get stuck at the same place at the ledge in the water rooms. I can never get them out because they can't jump out so I just have to terminate them and recast them in the next room. It is a real pain I hate those missions.

Hremic @ 12/10/2001 9:35:49 AM (Bow -> Martial Arts 3561):
As a level 45 Martial Artist, I have just spent/wasted a lot of money and ip on a new bow. I'm wielding this weapon mainly because of its Aimed Shot ability, which I hoped I could use in hunt, to pull one and one enemy to the group....

But there're problems. When I have fired the Aimed Shot, I immediately unequip the bow, to finish the target off with my fists.
My character goes into battle position, and starts hitting the target, without doing damage.... Neither MA, Brawl, Dimach or Attack of the Snake do work after using a bow. The enemy, though, keeps hitting me for the usual damage....

The problem is there even if I start a new battle (after fleeing cowardly from the enemy), and does only drop off when I zone (or log).

I have friends who have experienced this too, and as this is the only ranged weapon available for Martial Artists, I would like seeing this problem fixed.

While talking about bows, I would also like to know what the h... Bow Special Attack is good for. As far as I know, the character does little other than waving his right hand to the enemy, while no arrow is fired.

Will FunCom look into Bows, and make them possible for the Martial Artist to use? I hope so.

Criseyde @ 12/10/2001 10:35:26 AM (2584):
The guard thing happened again to me as I was running back to Tir.  It was with a different character.  What kind of bug is this?

Also, another problem is that both these times I petitioned for help but they never answered my petition!  It counted down.  Got to 5 and then disappeared.  I have waited up all night for an answer and now they just ignore me.  Why are there all these problems?

Acies @ 12/10/2001 10:53:15 AM (2584):

Neryn @ 12/10/2001 12:53:09 PM (Mission Completion Pending 3577):
Last night I spent nearly 3 hours on a mission, died twice in the process, to get an item I wanted. I made sure I cleared all the mobs out, went into every room a second time, just to make sure, before killing the mission objective. When I was fighting it, a message pops up saying "you must have two invertory spots free to get your mission reward, mission completion pending."

Ok, I empty two spots by putting some junk on the ground while still fighting the objective. I kill it, stand around waiting for it to decay, waiting for my reward. Nothing! My mission key and icon are gone, i walk outside th mission entrance, I get the "You are in the correct area..." message, but cannot get back in. I head back to town, click on th emission terminal I got the mission from a few times, also nothing.

I hung around in-game an hour afterwards and still never received squat. No reward item, no cash, no exp, no token, no nothing.

What I want to know is why you even bother putting such a message in for? Might just as well say, sorry pal you f***ed yourself because you didn't contantly check your inventory to make sure you kept 2 open spots, so no reward for you. Why the hell can't you put the reward and token in our bank boxes if our inventories get full???

zeroframerate @ 12/10/2001 2:21:46 PM (3435):

show me one thread where it is stated by funcom that over equiping is a bug?

it's not a bug...it's intentional.

there was a discussion by funcom of making equipment suddenly not work or un-equip if you didn't fit into the requirement sometime after patch 12.6.

there was such backlash and threats of people leaving that funcom rightfully dropped that idiotic idea.

Yme...your 10 points are more like 2 points stated over and over again.

your two points are this.

1) buffs have time limits
2) casters can't over equip

--------

1) buffs have time limits...so what?  the biggest buff, the trader's wrangler, has only a 2 min time limit...but what other purpose can it have but for over equiping weapons?  that is the only viable purpose for the nano.

2) casters' cant over equip...bullcrap.  lots of casting classes have nano-skill buffs that increase their nano-skill abilities.  so they cast the buff prior to entering into battle...when it runs out, they recast it.  also, they have the same abilities to make implants.  Also, no one is stopping casters from equipping higher armor.

again...those who don't like or don't understand how this game works should go to the rubika dimension where everyone is the same...i like the option of using better equipment and trying to "out-do" the other guy.

I have to say few things.

Last Night i was with my group 

We were all between 59 and 65  , with a level 73 Soldier. We also had an healer.
Another group  in 45-55 come in.

WE WERE COMPLETLY WIPED OUT.
We found a Mob with 28k Hp. I recharced my full nano up to 4 times.

Lots of Bugs like ,  Bewilder nanos not workin , target out of range  etc etc.

10 Players more than 45th level Wiped out Without chance.

Thinks this dungeon and its critters need a very good Fix or this place  is for 70-90 oriented group (with ql 40 items and 300 credits per loot mobs) ?
The fix should correct not only the bosses hp but also of the others Mobs.

I wonder to see how the new dungeon with  30-70 level range is...

Mustafo @ 12/10/2001 4:50:18 PM (Basic computer terminal in clan special shops? 3602):
Anyone notice that all the computer terminals for sales in the clan special shops are all basic?  Seems a bit odd to have a basic terminal in a clan superior special shop or a clan advanced special shop don't you think?  

Is this the same for omni?

Would love to see the appropriate level terminal in these shops instead of the basic one.

ragingsyph1 @ 12/10/2001 4:59:53 PM (3215):
i would like to find out if theyre broken or are weapon only and if it turns out theyre not for nano formulas

1) thats pretty lame, it says damage types, not weapons

2)again pretty lame, yet another example of NTs being the in game ankle grabbers

3)theyre all yours Maximillian,altho i'm Rubi2(what a mistake that was). whats your character name and i'll send you a tell.

That was for looting when your inventory is full.  I'm not sure that also applies to "inserted" items like rewards and tokens.  I hope it does, but it would be logical and that alone means it likely won't be implemented that way.

Ugh.

Mustafo @ 12/10/2001 6:46:57 PM (Nanos executing but nothing in chat 3618):
I ran into an odd problem yesterday using trader nanos.  Both health drain and ransack would execute and I would see the graphic, but I would get nothing in the chat window.  NO "fumble" or "countered" or "successful" or even "recharging" just nothing.  This happened alot yesterday.

I was also getting an huge amount of these same nanos countered.  On one occasion I was countered at least 5 times in a row by a green MOB.

Anyone else seeing these things?

Well, currently the Overflow window appears when you are going to get your mission reward(s) and do not have 2 free main inventory slots.

MaDezzie @ 12/10/2001 10:07:29 PM (3529):
I have two high body dev implants on my soldier.  I thought these were fixed, but I assure you they aren't.

When I initially installed them I got the increase in my HP, sat down, used a treatment kit, healed to full.  Zoned out of the shop, and my health was no longer full.  So I sit down and use a treatment kit again, and its not healing me.  So I zone again, try to use another kit, still no healing from it.

So I use my HP buff, then heal myself, and I finally healed to full.  Heh, then I zoned again, and I was no longer at full health.

Granted this isn't a 'game stopper' but it's incredibly annoying.  I'm assuming this is attributed to implants not being checked when you zone (kinda like the yalms unequiping).  Whatever the reason, it needs to be fixed please.

MaDezzie @ 12/10/2001 10:09:50 PM (3602):
Yes, its the same for Omni.  Doesn't matter if its a superior special, or advanced special shop.  The computer belts in there are usually one of the LOWEST ql's in existence.  

I agree, it makes no sense.

MaDezzie @ 12/10/2001 10:19:08 PM (3594):
I myself was in the Steps of Madness just yesterday, and I'll explain why you received the 'target out of range' messaging.

Because there are so many of those stalactite/stalacmite rocks billowing up from the ground in there, they seem to form some kind of invisible barrier between you and the mob you're attacking.  So if there is one of those 'rocks' in between you and the mob, you're gonna receive that out of range message.

Its the same in some mission rooms with desks, or chairs that stand in the way of you and the mob.  So even if you are at eye level with the mob, if there's an impassable object standing between you, you can't attack the mob, or target it for that matter.

I think this bug came up with 13.0.  Not sure though, maybe someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

Oh, and yes, I have to agree about the dungeon level.  The mobs inside are ridiculously overpowered for levels 40-50.  My team of 40-60 didn't have a prayer in there.  Supposedly the mobs in there had their HP's reduced, but IMHO they weren't reduced enough.

Scorus @ 12/10/2001 10:51:06 PM (3594):
And if you have a pet around those stalagtites and stalagmites, FORGET IT! My pet often can't find me to heal me even though we are almost right next to each other because of one of those.

This was part of the 'don't shoot through walls' fix, I'm pretty sure. It appears that an obstruction is an obstruction in AO no matter the height and we have a choice of whether we want MOBs shooting through all obstructions including walls or not being able to target and such through all obstructions including desks and stalagmites.

starknaked @ 12/11/2001 12:46:41 AM (Caves inside buildings! 3664):
Why is it that I get a mission, I go out to a building off in the world somewhere, enter the building through a door, and inside is a CAVE?

How can a cave be inside a building?

Aren't there enough horrible cave missions in the game without making more of them inside buildings?

And how can a cave have a locked door?  The "doors" are made of vines!  How can vines be locked?

I lagged into one of those rooms. Once I had control of my character again, I was stuck inside, and there was no way out. 

It was off hours so I petitioned. An ARK arrived and zoned me out. He told me to be careful around those rooms, because this is a known bug.

The only way to get rid of a Yalmaha is to intentionally delete it. They saw he had it before the crash, and didn't have it after, HE DIDN'T DELETE IT DURING THE SERVER CRASH NOW DID HE!? What a friggin moron that GM must be.

Duuuuuuuh he lost it in the crash give him a new one.

*Bump*

zeroframerate @ 12/11/2001 4:07:55 AM (3058):
Of course the damn bug is still in there. You didn't actually expect Funcom to actually FIX anything, did you?

Hell, they can't even prevent your inventory from re-arranging itself. What makes us think that they could possibly be competent enough to fix something like the minimum damage bug?

zeroframerate @ 12/11/2001 4:10:03 AM (Missions still ruined by incompetent programming. 3673):
50% mission are impossible due to the many bugs that are out there.

Even better is when you move the difficulty slider one tick to the left (literally one pixel), you get greens and greys only.

/me sighs.

Isisnorfret @ 12/11/2001 4:10:17 AM (3197):
lmao

Isisnorfret @ 12/11/2001 4:22:12 AM (2768):
Yes!! I've noticed the same thing. I have a lvl 100 enforcer with a 162 haxor, 588 attack rating. Sometimes I hit good, usually the mission starts out good, but after a while I start missing more and more untill I get about 1 hit per brawl. I like to do missions as much as the next guy, but standing there and missing 15 times in a row (I've actually counted that many misses in a row, and thats not counting the double swings, 30 animated swings, 15 blows that didn't land) just sucks.

It happens against any POD, in missions or hunting. It happens to almost every Medusa I fight. The rest of my group will be pounding away, and I'll just be swinging and never hitting.

I think that it might be some factor of initiative, I never noticed anything like this untill my melee init got over 500, and using rage / flurry of blows sometimes seems to make me hit more / less.

zeroframerate @ 12/11/2001 4:24:28 AM (3197):
So true.

Isisnorfret @ 12/11/2001 4:37:52 AM (2717):
I'm sorry but I don't see this as Funcom's fault.

I was doing lvl 100 missions at lvl 85. Right now I'm a lvl 100 enforcer, and I can do 50% missions without a problem, and thats using 2h edged (where's the +86 to 2h edged buff eh? no fair). It usually takes 45 mins to an hour to clear out a 50% mission, and thats dealing with the bug where I don't hit most of the time. 

Running Challenger is your first mistake. So you get a little extra damage for a minute, what is that compared to healing 108 points every two seconds? You are much better off running Mongo Bash repeatedly, (keep those nano kits handy.) Second, if you have to zone (which I never do unless I get more than one on me) don't spend much time out of the mission. If you have Mongo running then you will start healing as soon as you zone out, use two health packs (I use the ones that give 612) and in the meantime mongo heals you for 1000, so thats 2200 hp you heal in 30 seconds. Run back in and the mob will only have gained back like 1/8th hp.

If that is still not enough to solve your problem, maybe it is your weapon. If you're swinging something that is faster than 2.5/2.5 then really consider getting something else.

Etechie @ 12/11/2001 4:52:32 AM (3058):
Theres one of the reasons pet class rox. Pet min damage is uber !
Against a high AC mob, a soldier with q200 novaflow does consistent 30 damage and only crit once every 6 shots or so. A pet does 400-500 min damage and it just hits as fast as a soldier does.

Drhealth @ 12/11/2001 4:54:56 AM (2584):
I had one funny encounter too. I make a new MP character. Upon spawning in the backyard, I was happily uploading my first pet NF and summon the pet. When the pet appear, the guard just said the usual "I have enuff of blah blah blah.." and kill me. lol, get killed the very first minute into a new char.

Isisnorfret @ 12/11/2001 5:02:18 AM (2717):
Another thing..


	
		
			
			
				Are missions geared to people who can UBER twink thier characters? if so why the hell is it this way? Your punishing the people who dont have alot of money...and who dont uber twink or who can't...I use 2he weapons with my enforcer I would suspect that one SHOULD be able to do this as a viable option to the game...personally I dont want to be a CLONE
			
		
	
2h edged is fine... but being well equipped at your lvl isn't about having money.. the items you need to over-equip at your lvl can't be bought in stores - money becomes kind of useless actually. If you want to succeed you have to have friends, and you have to do a few group missions now and then to get the good items you need. The challenge of having to group with people to find the items I need is what keeps me playing this game.

It makes perfect sense to me that missions would be geared towards people who work with others to get high ql items and help each other equip them.

Not to sound like a bastage or anything but I think you can chalk your problems up to bad decisions along the way :-) But its not too late, especially with all the IP you get per lvl. Get in groups to get yourself a good weapon (none of that Sword of Sir Galahad crap either, something good like a longmoon) and some good armor, and go have fun soloing missions.

No no no, if you are using a fast weapon then the game is going to seem much much harder than it really is. Get yourself a slower harder hitting weapon and you'll do much better. Stun batons are like the worst weapon in the game... truly terrible.

Kneebreakcer @ 12/11/2001 8:04:37 AM (MA issues (yet again) 3688):
Just wondering if we can finally get ANY kind of response on the various Martial Artist bugs that have been with us since day one that Funcom doesn't seem to want to address.  Come on Funcom, tell us SOMETHING on these issues...

1.  Misc. weapons.  If you wield a weapon and your MA skill changes for ANY reason (i.e. buffing, debuffing, etc.) you lose your fist attacks until you unwield the weapon.

2.  Weapons and zoning.  If an MA is wielding a weapon and zones the MA loses the fist attack COMPLETELY, even if you unequip the weapon.  The only fix is to zone.

3.  Bows.  The bow special attack is still broken since release.

(for issues 1-3, how is it that only ONE profession in this game has issues with wielding weapons like this???)

4.  MA specific weapons.  Damage is less than what we can do with our fists AND they prevent you from using special attacks such as Blessed With Thunder, Bird of Prey, etc.  Essentially they hurt the MA to use them.

5.  Attack of the Snake.  All versions above QL 100 do NOTHING.  They've been broken since release.

6.  Bird of Prey.  The quality levels are far from being set right.  A QL 124 that I'm looking at right now has requirements as follows:  Martial Arts from 163, Dimach from 129.  So a level 30 MA with minimal implants could use this with no problem.

7.  Flower of Life.  What is this attack SUPPOSED to do?  All it does is harm the MA using the attack.

8.  Blessed with Thunder.  Funcom keeps saying they're going to nerf this because it's not working right.  Huh?  This is the only special attack that's really worth using and is what makes it possible for me to solo EVEN con mobs at level 86.

9.  Fist nano programs.  I'm currently using Fist of Fire which has the following description:  "Surrounds the fists of the target with fire, increasing BOTH melee and Fire-based damage by 13 points."  Well, I NEVER do fire damage.  Nor did I do any other types of damage that the other Fists programs claim to give you.

10.  Subconcious Guiding.  Now this is an interesting one.  It's supposed to increase chance to crit by 8%.  On myself, this seems to be accurate (no way to really tell since I don't know what my base chance for a crit is), however, on a Soldier that I group with it seems to increase HIS chance to crit by at least 50%.  He and I are constantly amazed at how often he crits compared to me when we both have this buff on (and he's 15 levels lower than me).  He crits at least 5 times for every crit I get.

I know there are other issues as well but this is just what I can think of off the top of my head.  Please Funcom, give some idea of WHEN, or even IF you ever plan to fix any/all of these MAJOR problems.

Cosmik @ 12/11/2001 8:05:03 AM (2584):

dirtboy @ 12/11/2001 8:24:44 AM (locked into implants 3692):
Just went on a shopping spree and got myself a few new nano clusters and combined them with a few implants I had from missions.  Now it seems I cannot swap, or remove any implants I have.  I meet all the requirements, but they just won't come out.  I am a level 15 agent, and I have a level 4 waist implant.  I wanted to replace it with a level 14 waist implant I had made but it won't go in when I use the surgery clinic.  I even tried to just remove the implants I had, no luck.  Thought it might be the clothes I was wearing, so I stripped.  Still won't come out.  I tried this in 3 different stores in three different cities, no luck.  Even logged out and logged back in to see if it would fix itself, but it didn't.  Now I am out of money.

Cosmik @ 12/11/2001 8:37:56 AM (3517):
I've been a victim of the "Green Swirling Mist from the Deep" too. I'll see that it gets looked into.

spydr @ 12/11/2001 10:12:27 AM (3692):
That happened to me with an eye implant.

I'm not entirely sure how it fixed itself, but I was having a heck of a time getting it out.  I just forgot about it and leveled a bunch.  About 5-10 levels later, it came right out (or rather, deleting it finally worked).

To delete, right-click-hold and choose the 'X'.  Confirm.

I lost my Kodiak the other day. When I logged off it was equipped, when I logged on again it was gone. I suspect it was because my inventory was full. Anyway, I petitioned and after a few responses from support when I was offline, first an ARK then a GM appeared in front of me. I was transfered to a "safe place" by the GM and I got my Kodiak back  Unfortunately, I had already bought a new car, so now I have 2 Kodiaks of the same QL. He wouldn't give me a credit refund. Too bad I can't trade the Kodiak, it's NODROP.

muftak @ 12/11/2001 3:05:53 PM (3688):
I can answer some of yor qustions.

your number 2:

If you zone with weapons on unequip weapons and buff your MA skill again. If you get deprive skills on you take weapons of and wait till end of de-buff and rebuff MA skill again, Works everytime for me. An ark told me once its to do with the way the fist are caulated seeing they dont exist. You fists get molded into the weapon and the game wont know you use the fists as well.

your number 4 :

My weapons are great i use them all the time. At the moment with QL60 acroblades im donig 70 to 72 damage ontop of my fists 70 to 350 damage. So what if you cant Use MA specails the damage balnces it self out with out losing any nano vital for healing during battles. The only this that would out damage the MA weapons is BWT seeing this has a way higher damage dealing power. But once i get my QL100 blades ill be out damaging that.

the rest i agree with you on.

hobbes @ 12/11/2001 3:07:29 PM (3197):
Now there IS a bug. Can't wait for the new patch to fix it.

I'm thinking of reporting you as an exploiter cause I can't imagine how you could have fairly accomplished the feat you describe.

Etechie @ 12/11/2001 3:32:29 PM (Problems being looked into ? 3739):
Ive petitioned a lot of bugs, "We are aware and looking into the problems", thats the answer funcom officials always give me. Take a look at the NT's board about Funcom reply to Garzu's email, Garzu listed like 10 problems, same response to every problem, you think most people will accept such reply ? 

If you want to keep your customers, get what customers want first. Stop spending resources into things like chat interface. Customers want a fun, non-crash, non-bug game ! 

A NT or Doc who is getting agroed more than a tank does is NOT fun. 
An Engineer who tired of fighting and cant do much tradeskills is NOT fun.
A soldier supposedly to be a killing machine has HARD time killing a green is NOT fun.
A guild with 40 members thats trying to raid 2HO crashed 4 times in a row in middle of big fight is NOT fun.
.
.
.

Well grouping is pretty fun, but killing after killing = boring, story lack of content, thats really not much to do in AO !

Id suggest Funcom to make a new top 10 priority list and give EVERY single of them a ETA ! And show everyone you can make the game better !

Oberan @ 12/11/2001 3:49:57 PM (3197):
what i want to know is why and how an ENFORCER equipped a q190 novaflow at that level. And how that enforcer was able to level when spending ip in so many dark blue skills to use the thing

(remember enforcers are melee soldiers are ranged)

Biffstatsnugly @ 12/11/2001 4:52:52 PM (3197):
Guess you could do it would not be that hard even if he only had 125ql implants. Being a enforcer he is not the norm.... that is for sure. But with alittle work and the correct buffs. ie. riot control, mastery, etc. would gimp you as a enforcer though i would think.

Biffstatsnugly @ 12/11/2001 5:09:07 PM (3594):
I have to agree i ran into steps when i was a lower level. around 65lvl with a full team of 60-70 lvl characters. Once you get into the dungeon towards the back of it where Neleb is you normally get dropped by 3 mobs (which are extremely grey) which all where hitting me for 400 hp damage??? 2200 ac's here. how does a 30-40 handle this place? Maybe the MOB got some lucky hits on me and crited me 3 times in a row who knows. I will admit that all the mob's where not hitting this hard just one type which looked like a bubble? Do not recall the name off the top of my head sorry. 

Anyway after losing half a 60 lvl party to a floating bubble, we regrouped and tried our hand at neleb by running literally thru the whole dungeon with mob's in tow. finally get to neleb's to die to him and 2 dragonclaws which where packed into his room with a few other hp inflated mobs. Point of the story. I am now lvl 80 and going back with a 80-104 group tonight to give it another shot. We have some experience with Neleb's so we are bringing 3 enforcers w/hammers and a doc. Need the high damage for the high hp mobs more then the speciality class's. Way too hard for a 30-40 group to make alone.

Shinji @ 12/11/2001 9:17:36 PM (3594):
I can just advise u to take a tradet with ya who can debuff the AC ofNeleb. Then killin will be much easier =D

godthe bugs!!!! @ 12/11/2001 9:26:32 PM (1951):
Should overequipping of weapons be allowed? of course, the buffs were put into the game to do just that.  But if they were meant to permanently raise a skill then they wouldnt have a timelimit on them!.  You should be able to overequip to your hearts content, as long as you have skills buffed up high enough to use it.  I mean come one here, if it takes a certain amount of skill to use a weapon and then your skill level drops, you should at the very least start doing minimmum damage since you dont have the skill to weild the weapon anymore!  Wanna do normal damage levels again? then get the buff back! otherwise use a lower QL weapon in the mean time.  Is overequipping a bug/exploit? No.  Is the ability to use the overequipped weapon after the skill buff runs out a bug(not exploit)? yes!  It is not an exploit because funcom allows you to keep the weapon in hand and use it at the same level, but it is definetly a bug.

godthe bugs!!!! @ 12/11/2001 9:33:35 PM (damage levels 3783):
ok, I usually dont put on my armor and weapons unless I am out hunting or in a mission.  Now yesterday I went into a mission and was going to buff up and change, when all of the sudden this bloodcreeper ganks me!  It wasnt a big deal, it was green and I was fast getting my armor on, but I noticed two things as I slowed down to think about what was going on.  First the fact that there was a mob in the first room was kind of disconcerting because I thought that room was supposed to be empty and that usually where I get dressed and buff up.  Second was the fact that when in my guild clothes, and in full armor the mob did the same damage.  Sure my armor class raised over 700 points from almost nothing, but that didnt seem to have any effect.  Buffs armor and all damage done was the same.  even when I finally remmebered in all the commotion to turn my agg/def bar all the way up to Agg I still did the same damage levels as did the mob.  The only difference that me getting suited up made was 1: I used my gun instead of fist, and 2: I attacked faster.  Anyone else notice anything like this?

Taldrin @ 12/11/2001 9:36:58 PM (3594):
We managed it with a full team of lvl 60s, but we had an eng (me) and a meta. Pets play a large part in defeating these mobs as they have high hit points themselves, well engineer pets anyway  .

In the last room while we waiting for Neleb to spawn again I decided to check out this wall of crystals. Jump in... STUCK!
Before I had chance to say anything 2 of the team had also jumped through and got stuck themselves. Petitioning did nothing (as usual). I was 33rd in the queue for over an hour, by which time we called upon a mass suicide 

2nd time I went we were half way through when a team of grey omni's charged in behind us and demanded we leave. We got all kinds of abuse from them, even saying they'd petition about us  Calling it their spot because it was in omni forest. [sarcasm] Now we don't see omni's at the cyborg dungeon do we? [/sarcasm]. Bottom line, if there's another team there come back some other time or fight for the rewards. Don't ***** at them because you want the whole dungeon for yourselves.

I reckon a full team of pet classes with at least 2 metas could handle the SoM at the stated levels.

He is right about not trying it when there is another team there. My team was doing fine pulling one at a time in the SoM dungeon and then another team pulled a big group and we were toast. Unfortunately it will probably be another year before you will find the early dungeons empty.

Yes.  While I still wear armor to feel "safer", I have seen no difference between wearing armor or not wearing armor...

To test this the other day0 I:

Fought a green mob in plain clothes (MA Trader)
Zoned out
Put on a BATTLE SUIT 2k AC
Fought him again

No difference.

I have also testing this in similar situations.

Now, with a 2k battlesuit, the mob should have been doing 200 points of damage less per hit.

Didn't make a difference, though...

should I just stop wasting my money on armor or what? hell If I stay away from PvP areas does this mean that I can just go everywhere in my guild outfit and save all my money to get a yalmaha? man this is getting more and more depressing as I stay the only decent thing left is the role-playing I do with my guild and I could do that in a chat room.  Though of course there wouldnt be any pretty toons to look at, but then again since I dont have an uber box everythings fuzzy anyways.


Glad I just signed up for the EVE beta... maybe theyll pick me since I have beta tested this game for the last 5 months.

Zaal @ 12/11/2001 11:08:44 PM (3692):
Sounds to me like you weren't using the surgery clinic to take the implants out.  You need to be "supervised" by a surgery clinic when swapping implants.

hobbes @ 12/11/2001 11:33:05 PM (3783):
I've posted on this before. It seems that changing armour only changes the numbers on your display, but does not effect the damage you take.

I have noticed that the Evade close combat skill reduces the # of crits and amount of damage.

I finally saw tank armour today and checked out its profile. I noticed it reduced Evade close combat, I therefore doubt this stuff is very useful.

But seriously man, how could you expect something like armour to actually work when nothing else does.

Zaal @ 12/11/2001 11:35:35 PM (3783):
Good lord.  Does anything work in this game?

Zaal @ 12/11/2001 11:38:27 PM (3058):
Bump.

And Cosmik, I remember a while ago that you guys took steps to make battles go faster.  That's defintely NOT the case with this minimum damage bug still here.  12.5 was still by far the best build of the game.

hobbes @ 12/11/2001 11:40:13 PM (Flurry of fist/ lethargy of fists. 3790):
With flurry of fists I noticed it added 150 to my baseline melee init. for a few seconds. Then it subtracted 150 from my baseline for the remainder of the fight. The only way to correct is zoning.

This is not news, ok. Was mentioned weeks ago. Why don't you fix this, ok.

Please, don't respond to this, I might think you care.

blu789 @ 12/11/2001 11:44:33 PM (3790):
This is an old bug, and it happens with weapons also.  I think it's from beta 4.  I can't recall how to recreate it consistently, but it happens.

DOH!!! forgot I'm a fixer, of course I cant do anything!!!!


nope, just figured out the one thing I can do very well:

Have uber gimped NT's own me.  And not to mention I do a fine job dying to green mobs.  I dont even think super-overequipping could save me since armors broke.

4 times in 30 minutes. On one occasion it killed me. I know you guys have top men on the job, but this is unreal. It isn't my ISP; I'm on cable and it never drops, you guys just decide my ten minutes is up and boot me. I'm not alone with this issue and it's not the first time it's been brought up. 
Fix this before anything else. It's not much of a game if you can't play it for longer than 10 minutes without being booted.

I always wonder why I get caves in the middle of Rome.

And the "unlocking vines" thing has often crossed my mind -- I mean, I beat the crap out of large, metal A-5000 Elite bots with my bare hands. You'd think I could slice or punch open a vine door with little effort, but nope, I have to unlock it.

Morgl @ 12/12/2001 2:54:21 AM (Couple of bugs. 3814):
Well, i'm just mentioning a couple of bugs that i've found in AO that have been bugging me(no pun intended).

Bug #1.
Treatment clinics.
Sometimes, after I die, I use a treatment after the res effects are gone. However, after the first one, sometimes the second one, The treatment doesn't heal me for much, or anything at all. Only way to fix it is to either camp out, or zone.

Bug #2.
Scooplets.
These little buggers do tend to beat on you fairly quick, and when you kill them, they don't give any experience points. You can loot them but you get nothing else.

Gold @ 12/12/2001 4:08:48 AM (At level 101, I SHOULD be able to take ql 180 missions. 3820):
But, incredibly enough, something doesn't work in ao.

I get MAX ql 151.

Ofcourse, I checked 3 different towns, 8 different terminals (I've talked to ARK/GMs b4). I check team missions terminals...(lol, well, I know it doesn't work, but I have like I said talked to ARK/GMs b4).

Now, this is ofcourse a known problem amongst the players. People had this problem long b4, alot of people have petitioned about it. That u can't take missions at high level, when others your level (and under) can take high missions.

So, I petitioned...and the ark (nice guy, no complaint there) said that well, HE had seen it b4, but he wasn't sure that Funcoms developers knew about it. He asked me to bug report and write here.

Ofcourse, I lost all my belief in the intelligence of funcoms developers LONG ago...my fav is still Avalons "weapon" shop. Prolly the easiest thing to change...but last I checked, it was still armor. I petitioned, bugreported etc etc about that like...eeh..3 months ago. Anyways, he said that Funcom actually DO read here every now and then. I guess it's alot less to read now that 90% of the players have left the game.

So, if the people from funcom wants to know more about this bug (I kinda hope they know about it...hope is the last thing that dies I guess) u can write here, contact me in-game, or email me. I will (unlike you) answer as fast as possible, and give u all the information I can possible assemble.


Now, that said...just a question...That memory-leak u introduced 3 (or was it 4?) patches ago...any special reason why it was implemented, or just so we can't zone too much without having to reboot? It's extremely annoying and if it's intention was to get people to leave ao, I don't think u have to go to such extremes. I mean, people are leaving every day? I actually created a char on rubi-2 a month ago...hehe...I checked the population on different servers when I played there...I used the whompa between nlc and oa, and 33% of the population changed from nlc to oa. Was really weird, cuz I didn't see any1 else there. Guess it was just...me.

Final words: Funcom, I hope u can read between the sarcasm and scorn and find my for others obvious problem, and then actually FIX it...without destroying something else please!

I am not gonna play my lvl 101 agent for a while now...and unless u start to fix ao, I won't be playing my other chars either.


Another extremely fed up misgruntled ao-player.

Kneebreakcer @ 12/12/2001 4:29:48 AM (3688):
If you zone with weapons on unequip weapons and buff your MA skill again. If you get deprive skills on you take weapons of and wait till end of de-buff and rebuff MA skill again, Works everytime for me. An ark told me once its to do with the way the fist are caulated seeing they dont exist. You fists get molded into the weapon and the game wont know you use the fists as well. 
			
		
	
So what you're saying is that if I'm fighting a mob that deprives skills on me at the beginning of a fight I should just run or die since I can no longer use my PRIMARY attack???  You're saying this isn't a bug???  I don't doubt what the ark told you, but  bad that's like a car manufacturer telling me not to use my turn signals on my brand new car because they short out the engine.  That's not a feature.  It's bad workmanship.


	
		
			
			
				My weapons are great i use them all the time. At the moment with QL60 acroblades im donig 70 to 72 damage ontop of my fists 70 to 350 damage. So what if you cant Use MA specails the damage balnces it self out with out losing any nano vital for healing during battles. The only this that would out damage the MA weapons is BWT seeing this has a way higher damage dealing power. But once i get my QL100 blades ill be out damaging that.
			
		
	
So what level are you?  At level 86 I do 120-650 mele damage with my fists, not counting brawl which I hit for up to 1300 with (and this is with only implants that I've built my self and armor I've acquired on my own since I mostly solo).  Add on to that 200  damage every 10 seconds consistently with Blessed with Thunder.  So I should wield weapons that, just like any other weapons can cause me to lose all that damage when my MA skill changes by even one point?  I say again, it's not worth it.  I fight way too many mobs that cast debuffs and since I like to fight yellows and oranges it would be suicide.

I realize I'm kind of ranting here and please don't take it personally.  I just get frustrated when someone tells me that something that is obviously broken works just fine.  I don't care what the justifications are (of which there haven't even been excuses from Funcom, much less answers), I just want the problems that have been here since day one fixed.  Especially when the programmers are spending time adding in "important" new features like additional chat channels, changing the colors of chat text and adding new nightclubs.   Sure they're nice to have.  So is a fancy custom paintjob on a car.  But of the car stalls every 20 feet, it kind of defeats the purpose.

Etechie @ 12/12/2001 6:34:59 AM (3811):

Nano Pool Implants for some reason don't work since beta (feature?!). They do indeed increase the nanopool in your skill table, but it doesn't increase the max nano. It doesn't work on my engineer, it doesn't work on my enforcer and guess what....it doesn'tm work on my crat either. it's usually just Bright spot in the Head implant i'm interested in

Mascot @ 12/12/2001 12:38:07 PM (3529):
What strikes me as hilarious is the fact that FC fixed this in a previous patch without documenting it. Then in the patch after they documented that it would be fixed, and turns out they broke it again instead.

Brilliant version control, FC. Are you guys positive you don't want some help on that? I supervise version control for multinational projects on a daily basis so I do have some basis for saying with 100% certainty version control is a total mess at FC HQ.

Mascot @ 12/12/2001 12:53:07 PM (3234):
Woot? You actually *got it back*? That's the first time I've heard of AO not adhering to their "if you lose it it's gone forever, we won't reimburse you" policy.

Is this an official change, Cosmik/Cz?

muftak @ 12/12/2001 1:57:49 PM (3688):
I didnt say it wasnt a bug i said it is a BUG. You should still be able to skill something with just the weapons that what i ment to say. Ive never had deprive skills at the start of the fight ever alllways when hes half dead.

im LVL 66 btw and you dont lose your damage with MA skill cuase it dosnt drop the MA skill it drops your attack rating.

Ok with buffs i have 480 MA skill about 220 peicing skill i put the blades on and the Attack rating drops from 480 to about 380 but i still hit for the same with my fists. If i could use BWT i would but i never trained Parry skill from the start and im not now in case they fix BWT.

I fight yellows and oranges all the time on 50% missions and never have a problem only against those damn anuns and A-4000 elites.

I want the MA fixed as much as you do the bugs have been there snice day one ,some have been fixed and some are along time coming. I love the MA weapons my BOP has been retired snice i got them doing 140 damage every attack round on the fists has made it alot easyier. But as you say your lvl 86 and im 20 lvls off that so my opions could change. I just came to state what i know about the weapons not taking a dig at you at all.

starknaked @ 12/12/2001 2:35:30 PM (3529):
Cosmik, we've been reporting this bug for months.  This is nothing new.

starknaked @ 12/12/2001 2:40:47 PM (64 ncu/ 6 slot belts don't spawn 3876):
Hello, Cosmik, are you aware of this?

NCU memory units and belts no longer appear as mission rewards or in chests, at any quality level.

Because the only way to get q125+ items is in missions or as loot, this means that 6 slot belts and 64 ncu memory units can't be obtained anymore.

Is this intentional?

How are high level players supposed to buff themselves up when their buffs all take up huge amounts of NCU space and they can't get the necessary items to raise their ncu space anymore?

ManicMiner @ 12/12/2001 3:34:42 PM (3692):
I had this lately, I was at an automated surgery clinic (the same one that I had used previously, successfully) and I was unable to remove or add any implants even though I had the necessary requisites to do so.

Basically it was a waste of credits, waste of time and left me wondering what to try next!

zeroframerate @ 12/12/2001 4:42:50 PM (Minimum damage bug still present. What I experienced last night: 3893):
I went a-hunting in Lush Fields at the NW Mine (near the Outpost).

I was melee-ing and brawling REDS for more damage than I do to human GREEN mobs. It was ridiculous and I was shocked. Made me think I should do more RED hunting instead of fighting against the invincible human GREEN mobs.

C'mon, Funcom, make this game playable for us.

Nietya @ 12/12/2001 5:34:23 PM (3820):
thanks for the fixer comment, that's flattering...

as for the memory leak, I don't know what you're doing wrong, but on a p2-350 with 280 RAM, I can play this game for 8+ hours straight over multiple zones (over 8 at least) without a problem at all...  so, maybe it's your system, not theirs...

and the thing in avalon, well, if it takes 2 minutes to fix that, that's 2 minutes that could be spent on something more important, of which there are many.  even if it took 20 seconds (which I doubt), that's still a priority issue.  personally, I see most people approving of the ignoring of stupid/trivial bugs to fix big issues.

So your level 101 character can't get QL180 missions?  Well damn, my level 51 player can't DO level 53 missions.  Try playing a fixer.  Again, it's called priorities.  You playing your uber-ultra-twink-min-maxed-overequipped-agentofdoom isn't as important as entire class types that can't run missions EQUAL to their QL.

Just a thought.

Yes, and the fixes after 12.6 were also pleasant. I didn't really have a problem with my MA until the minimum damage bug appeared. It made something that has been a problem before even more noticable and annoying. I.E., the fact that martial artists have always complained about minimum damage past level 100. 

But 13.0 introduced plenty of folks to the world of min. damage, not just MAs.

zeroframerate @ 12/12/2001 7:13:23 PM (3893):
Maybe I should be expressing it as a human mob AC bug.

But it's weird that I hit for 49 damage consistently against human GREEN mobs when I hit for over 60 (and the damage will vary) on RED monster mobs.

Course those green human mobs with those damage shields put out more damage than those red monster mobs.

dirtboy @ 12/12/2001 8:49:45 PM (3692):
I was definitely using the surgery clinic.  I was standing right in front of it, and when I tried to remove the implant and it failed to come out, I clicked on the clinic again and got a message saying I couldn't use it until my 5 minutes was up from using it seconds before.

Just another voice in the wilderness.  I too get the random
disconnects.  For a while, it seemed like it was during high traffic
times; then I created a char on RK-2; and played during low traffic (at times, RK-2 seems *completely* devoid of other people... : ) , and still, the disconnects happen.

Sometimes, I get a few minutes of play.  Sometimes, I get hours, and am able to log off normally.  But the disconnects are happening frustratingly often, and interfere with gameplay a *lot*.  Missions are bad; but hunting with a team is worse.  

Please, please, please, please fix this.

Should overequipping of weapons be allowed? of course, the buffs were put into the game to do just that.  But if they were meant to permanently raise a skill then they wouldnt have a timelimit on them!.  You should be able to overequip to your hearts content, as long as you have skills buffed up high enough to use it.  I mean come one here, if it takes a certain amount of skill to use a weapon and then your skill level drops, you should at the very least start doing minimmum damage since you dont have the skill to weild the weapon anymore!  Wanna do normal damage levels again? then get the buff back! otherwise use a lower QL weapon in the mean time.  Is overequipping a bug/exploit? No.  Is the ability to use the overequipped weapon after the skill buff runs out a bug(not exploit)? yes!  It is not an exploit because funcom allows you to keep the weapon in hand and use it at the same level, but it is definetly a bug. 
			
		
	

I have to agree.  Why else is there a time limit on the stat buffs?  The idea that you are supposed to be able to equip a weapon 50 levels higher than you if you can just manage to get the stats high enough for even a second is just laughable.  It would be an interesting idea if there were no time limits on the buffs; only for things like the Heals over Time; and obviously hostile "buffs" (ransacks, i.e.).  That way, you could have your super uber mega gun equipped; but you would have to give up your reflect shield, your extra health, and your boosted run speed.  Indeed, I think I would enjoy that game; there would be an element of strategy in your choices.  NCU becomes your limiting factor; and there is also
a reason to cast some of those older, smaller nanos.  Hurm.  The more I think about it, the more I like this idea.  If I ever make my own game... 

As it is; you get yourself mega-buffed; over-equip; and are done.  Buffs wear off; all you have to do is not accidentally un-equip.  No thought has to be done at all.  

Obviously, there is a very strong attraction to being the most powerful person in the game; to have *THE* best weapon equipped.  Otherwise there wouldn't have been such an outcry against it when there was a proposal for making weapons and armor not work when the stats didn't support it.  (*cough* Okay, that and the likelihood that it would have introduced an unimaginable world of bugs... *cough*)   And indeed, the desire to be ultra-powerful compared to MoBs [especially at the lower levels] is so high that I seriously doubt that any proposal FC comes up with will be acceptable to the vast majority of players.  

I forget the exact phrasing of the various tutoring devices, but their phrasing always gave me the impression that *implants* were supposed to be the things you could boost yourself to use, and get a permanent effect.  Unfortunately, the AO interface allows weapons and armor to be used the exact same way.  I believe this is an unintentional side effect; but only FunCom really knows for sure.


As to one of Borraces points:

"2) casters' cant over equip...bullcrap. lots of casting classes have nano-skill buffs that increase their nano-skill abilities. so they cast the buff prior to entering into battle...when it runs out, they recast it. also, they have the same abilities to make implants. Also, no one is stopping casters from equipping higher armor"

This recasting of which you speak, isn't this *EXACTLY* what those agains overequipping are saying is just fine?  If you have the buffs to equip whatever gun or armor, or to cast a  higher nano, fine.  But when it wears off, *you have to recast it*.  That is, once you can no longer use it, you can no longer use it.  When you can use it, you can use it.  Simple, fair, even.  


My only real problem with overequipping is that if the game is balanced to deal with overequipping; those who do not overequip suddenly can't play, or at the very least, have a much harder time.  There is also the PvP aspect, there is simply no contest between say, the doc who has an overequipped shotgun by 30-40 levels, and the poor little soldier who equips just the best he can using his own personal buffs.  And honestly, that's just silly to me.  And far far far worse when it's the other way around.

Heh.  And think about the *trapped* locked vines...

I've also noticed occassionally in missions, I'll come across a locked door that I can pass through.  It doesn't block passage at all (not sure if it blocks line of sight).  But I can get a quick 90-100 xp by turning around and unlocking it anyway; so the game obviously realizes there is a door there.  Go figure.

Nietya @ 12/12/2001 11:36:09 PM (1951):
Jesus, people, think about this one.

I overequip.

I want them to change it.

I'd be ok if I was given a warning and told to get gear that I could wear of my own volition.

I'm ok with losing some fake money in a fake world (but keeping the gear that I worked and paid for) in order to make the world a more balanced place for ALL classes.  MA's, NT's, everyone.

I'm a fixer, so I suck, even though I overequip.  What I suggest would gimp me more, right?  Wrong.  If Funcom did something to address overequipping, I'm sure they'd tone down mob strengths as well.


This isn't about dedication.  This isn't about choosing one playstyle over the other.  This is about you people that paid a trader to wrangle the hell out of you, paid an enforcer for the str/sta buff or 2hb buff, paid the agent for feline grace, paid the fixer for... oh, that's right, MINOR SUPRESSOR (lol, sorry, had to fit that in)... 

You would lose money.  That money represents time you played this game to earn it.  Is that right?  No.  But is it right to leave things the way they are?  With EVERYONE but the mega-uber-freak overequippers unable to stand toe to toe with a green in PvM after level 60?

Choose the lesser of two evils.  Funcom ought to.

Again, I reiterate, I overequip.  As much as I can.  I'm a level 51 fixer that can take mobs 2 to 3 levels higher than myself, thanks to my phat overequipping prowess.  But I pray for the day when Funcom makes this unrealistic unbalancing unbalanceable crap stop.

FIX IT.

And fix the human AC's while you're at it.  I do 180-250 dmg average to a creature.  I do 75 damage average to a human.  They give more or less the same xp, bang for my buckwise.  I delete missions with humans in it.  I delete missions with these idiotic scooplets in them.

So..... I'm having to play the game in a way you didn't intend in order to enjoy it.

Please address this.

Odd...

I never get disconnected.  On my 1.4 t-bird with half a gig of ram and a geforce 2...

Or on my p2-350 with 280 RAM and a geforce 1...

Both on earthlink DSL.  Perhaps it's your provider?

I've been disconnected a total of one time, on my beast machine, in the last three weeks.

Nietya @ 12/12/2001 11:48:03 PM (3893):
Heh, there's the ticket... green human mobs compared to red *monster* mobs.  Try attacking a red human mob.

Then delete the mission/move to another hunting area.

Killing creatures is the only way to reliably get xp/money for your time... human mobs are screwed up.

Dimenom @ 12/13/2001 1:51:22 AM (Since Tuesday, more disconnections 3962):
Since Tuesday 11th November, I've had higher ping and lag, and more disconnections than over the last month.  It happens everywhere: in cities, travelling to missions and in them with just me and a bot.

Disconnecting 5-10 minutes after logging in is annoying in cities and very annoying in missions as I may lose the bot if I dont log back in soon enough (and then have to take the time to trim and buff a new one, in which time I could be disconnected again).  So far this hasn't happened during a fight with a mob my bot couldnt finish off, but I'd hate to be on my own and then die.

Lagging during a fight means the mob stores up hits on me or the bot but I can't, neither can I heal leaving me close to dying a few times.

Due to these problems I've nearly stopped playing for the time being as I spend as much time waiting while the client notices that I've been disconnected, then unloading the client and logging back in, in the hope that the bot hasn't dissapeared as I do actually playing.

I don't want to start blaming anything without any proof, but... I hope this isn't related to the database update you performed the day this started.  Whatever this is can you please fix it soon as I'm enjoying playing an engineer (much, much more than a nt)

Ashuras @ 12/13/2001 3:10:19 AM (3962):
Hey.. so I'm not the only one!

It is damm strange.. after that downtime... I can even get disconnected while zoning into a mission cave.

It had not happened to me for such a LOOONNNG time...

Did u guys change anything ? Or did the player population increased a lot due to the free re-trial offer to ex-players ?

Misophist @ 12/13/2001 3:17:50 AM (3962):
Yes, more disconnects for me, as well. Actually, I had none before, really (since June), so this is definitely new.

Kodiene @ 12/13/2001 7:51:40 AM (Mission Rewards & Locations that change after zone/grid/ctd 3982):
This is a major problem for me. I zone/grid/CtD and when I look at the mission again.....its changed! What!? How!? Will this be fixed!? 

It has happened countless times to me and me /petitions must be falling on deaf ears. 

Last nite I camped a term for a decus coat and when I hopped the grid to Lush (where the mission was there), not only had the mission reward changed to something different, the location changed as well!!!! 

>>After 30 minutes of mission camping = Decus coat in Lush Fields
>>After a grid to Lush Fields = SMG in Pleasent Meadows!!

I can't do ANY missions in PM! My big Trox Enforcer has no need for a SMG!

Thanks Funcom (AO team). I had to log after waiting 2.5 hours for my /petition.

In the future, will a GM/ARK be able to verify my mission reward and Location and change it back? I would hope so as I don't see this getting fixed for a while. 

Missions w/out the PROMISED reward results in not taking missions which leads to not playing as much and you can guess the end result. 

Missions are boring and w/a chance for your reward changing during ANY zone/grid/CtD you will lose even more gamers.

Well im level 100, and can take ql 179 missions. At level 112 u can take ql 200, so i think at 101 u can even take higher then 180. Also no one can fight stuff this high (at this level even fighting greens when uber twinked can be tuff). You dont fight the monsters, u blitz and run for ur life! Only way to get higher ql stuff which is what u need, no one needs the same ql as there level

peterrjg @ 12/13/2001 9:17:58 AM (3811):
Well Nietya, I'm happy for you. If you survey this particular forum you'll see quite a few people are getting this issue. It has zero to do with my ISP. 

"It's your provider" was Verant's classic escape clause all-purpose answer. Let's not get Funcom in that mood.

Toser Ban @ 12/13/2001 9:20:25 AM (3982):
I never heard of this problem before. Are you sure that it wasn't a mistake on your end when picking the mission (no offense - that happened to me a few times when I accidentially clicked on a mission in the term at the beginning of reward/location checking, but wanted to accept another one later...  ) ?

I do a lot of hunting in Lush and PM, and never have that happened to me.

Stryphe @ 12/13/2001 3:22:02 PM (3811):
Just to re-affirm my previous post.

It doesn't matter who your ISP is.  I had the disconnect problem when the game was first released.  Initially I tried to reduce the maximum speed of my modem (suggested by an IT person on a different board).  

BTW, I use a USR 56K.

When I reduced the setting from 115K to 57K the disconnects stopped.  HOWEVER, this was about 2 months ago.  Since then I cancelled my account and un-installed AO.  

Now I come back (a couple of patches later) and the disconnects are back and nothing seems to help.

I'm wondering if the AO team has made some adjustments elsewhere that render my fix useless.

PS  This fix worked for me once, but not everyone had the same experience.  And yes, I've tried all the FAQ ideas and I'm still dropped.

How is that solved?  I was wondering why a superior shop would have basic terminals.  I never said I couldn't find them.  Why is it that Athen old has 8 basic computer terminals and only 2 superior.  Are there that many newbies who would bother to look in a clan special superior store for their 4 to 8 NCU modules or their (at most) 3 slot belts?  Well if they know they are there maybe, but that really isn't a solution to the problem.

PROBLEM:

There are basic computer terminals in superior special shops.  

NOT THE PROBLEM :

I can't  find superior computer terminals in other shops.

Of course I can but I wanted to find out why the type of store doesn't affect the quality of the terminal inside, not to point out I couldn't find one.

Alaysia @ 12/13/2001 4:47:31 PM (3295):
do one of two things: 

1) raise ur va skill one point, zone with plane - if it comes off, u havent raised it high enough - repeat.

2) just deal with it as u go up in level; eventually ur sense/agi will be high enough without the implants to keep the plane equipped.

zeroframerate @ 12/13/2001 5:07:41 PM (Difficulty slider is bugged methinks. 4016):
50% missions produce impossible-to-kill -----|o---- human mobs.

What happens if you set the slider ONE PIXEL to the left of 50% (in other words 49%)?
Missions with 90% grey mobs and 1 out of every 10 chests actually have items in them. Rest are deep green mobs and the loot in the chests that have loot are ammo.

What gives? Why the huge disparity in mission difficulty? I'm trying to get missions that have -----o----- as the best mob in the mission and it's impossible to get that. I wasn't expecting nearly all greys and worthless loot at 49% difficulty.

Alaysia @ 12/13/2001 5:11:46 PM (Bewilder Nanos FUBAR 4017):
the bewilder line ( for traders, at least -- dunno bout other profs ) is so awfully fouled up right now.. forget for a moment the auto-attack on attempting to cast a bewilder -- although assinine, thats a different issue. the nanos just arent working properly - u can tell immediately because although the successful cast message joyfully pops up, there is no nano-effect animation on the mob - so if u change area at all - like into water, out of water, over bridge, go near door - jump on table, etc. u instantly get re-aggrod.  

this is happening 50% of the time and much more frequently if there's anything like a table or such in the room. okay, so this, combined with the 'queuing up' of attacks from mobs - so u get hit 2-3 times after ur bewilder lands successfully - causing u to re-aggro the mob each time, PLUS the lag in ur re-aggro between the server and the client, meaning u never really know when ur aggro'ing the mob, and then add in the total bs of getting 'stuck' like some mentally-challenged pet on the edge of water - and u might just as well delete this line of nanos.  bewilder is the only way some of us have any hope of getting thru missions anymore - but u know, thats not important or anything.

*edit*

ive heard this has something to do with the hidden charm resist check ( vs. psychic ) -- hmm.. if thats the case i find the message 'nanoprogram executed successfully' and the fact that they do stop attacking until u do anything that invokes a perception check ( and lord, what doesn't? ) a bit misleading at best.

zeroframerate @ 12/13/2001 5:14:55 PM (265):
Those catwalk-over-slime mission areas are the worst to get through. It is possible to get back onto the catwalk from a ledge, but it definitely takes a great deal of control and luck. They also wreak havoc with pet pathing.    I wish Funcom would get rid of those ... or at least fix the design of them.

As for the getting trapped in the water holes, ya, the best way to overcome that invisible barrier is to jump up and then run forward at the peak of your jump. There seems to be a problem with the geometry there where the two sides meet.

But if we zoned that shouldn't have happened!

Occassionally, I run into a problem where I can't use nano-stims or healing-stims during combat.  A very frustrating (and potentially lethal) problem.  Even after the combat, it still often disallows using them.  However, I discovered with my doctor character, if I attack myself, it somehow fixes the problem.  I have no idea why, but repeated tests have yielded 100% success so far.  May also work for those of you who can't use kits after a combat.

BTW, good point about melee weapons as loot.  Very rare.

stergir @ 12/13/2001 10:06:39 PM (1951):
Yme and Xen hit the mark perfectly.

Basically, why in the hell should a temporary buff allow you to permanantly equip an implant that permanantly allows you to equip armor/weapons way above your lvl.  Jeezus, why not leave the buff on PERMANANTLY while ur dreaming in ur unrealistic gaming thoughts.  BTW, overquiping is NOT and exploit untill it's used to PERMANANTLY equip items.

Comon this can't be too hard to fix.  When a buff runs out:

1. Decrease the skill/s accordingly.

2. Do and implant check and decrease the effectivness of implants that no longer meet minimum requirements

3. Decrease the skill/s accordingly again.

4. Do a armor/weapon check and decrease the effectivness of anything that no longer meet minimum requirements

PRESTO!  The game becomes realistic again.  I'm a programmer and I'm good at what I do.  I can sit here and build code in my head on how I would do it if I was sitting in the FC offices.  Comon FC this has gotta be the biggest problem of them all.  Send the newb programmers out on their butts and get the good ones to fix this in a day or two.

Oh BTW,  when the "event" fires to reload ur weapons I would do something stupid like this:

1. Display a FREAKING "Reloading message" as soon as u start.

2. Not allow flingshots and burst to be fired when reloading.

3.  OH AND THE BEST ONE OF THEM ALL!!!!  Display a reloaded message when ur done reloading instead of the dumb "Reloaded" message.  LMAO,  comon even a newb programmer can do that one.

Meetshield @ 12/13/2001 10:57:31 PM (3435):

So true - and another side effect is the homogenization of all professions.  Does Sniper's Bliss give an agent any advantage over any profession?  No, since I can get the "temporary" buff by shelling out a few K credits and permanently equip my gun.  

Consider this - two agents are identical in every way, execpt only one has sniper's bliss.  They both buy the same rifle that has slightly higher requirements than they have.  The agent with sniper's bliss buffs both of them, and they spilt up to hunt.  Suddenly, in the middle of battle, the buffs run out!  Well, in the lame system we currently have, who cares...  The agents dish out the same damage.  What *should* happen is that the agent who actually bought the buff will self-use it, and keep self-using it.  The agent that didn't buy the buff should suffer.  In this way, Agents can use their buff as an advantage for themselves and their teammates.

Slimed @ 12/13/2001 11:45:02 PM (Combining QL200 implants with high NP 4075):
This is a bug report, please comment if you have experienced this.

*Symptoms*

Upon combining clusters in QL200 implants with a high score of nano programming (for example 800+), the combine doesn't work, and no feedback is given as to why nothing happens.

*Possible Cause*
When combining with high NP, the resulting implant QL is slighly higher than the QL of the implant before putting in the cluster.  Because implants with a higher QL than 200 do not exist in the game, the combine fails.  This is especially true with faded clusters.

*Example*

I tried combining a faded nano cluster into a QL200 right hand.  The combining required around 420NP.  At 858 and 608 NP, the cluster did not go in.  A friend with lower NP tried and the cluster went in without a problem.

*Solution*
Cap the resulting implant QL at 200, but do not prevent combining for the high end nano programmers.

Thank you!

Im a lv 42 MA(and proud of it ), i attack for 30-130 melee damage but many times i simply hit for 32 all the time...this keeps up for about 30 minutes. I can barely kill a green with this bug, also (like that wasn't bad enough) my brawl and special attacks are also doing minumum damage.

Cern @ 12/14/2001 1:16:10 AM (4075):
I can tell you EXACTLY why this is happening:

I'm sure every nano programmer knows that if you combine a cluster into an implant sometimes the resulting implant increases in ql.  Example :  Put a ql 90 cluster in a ql 90 inplant and the resulting inplant may become a ql 91 implant:

Several months ago before many ppl posessed the skill to make or wear ql 200 implants, a terrible bug was found.  When combing ql 200 implants, if the implant attempted to become ql 201,202,203 etc... , the combined implant would become a ql 1 pair of pants, or a statue, or any other worthless ql 1,2,or 3 item.

This was devastating!  At this time, ql 200 implants were EXTREMLY hard to come by.  I personally know a programmer who sat for hours with gm's in game showing them this bug and trying in vain to get implants replaced. 

Well, it seems that funcom decided that the easiest way to correct this problem was NOT to actually fix the problem, but rather try to cure it by using some workaround.  lol

I'm not sure how to fix your specidic troubles tho.....

Just another batched job by funcom

Playing a mission now. Flurry of fists still doesn't work. It drops melee init to 59 from baseline of 203. Zoning fixes this but I lose my mission map.

I want to thank you ****heads for answering my last post a week or so ago so promptly. I expect an equally courteous and prompt reponse this time. 

P.S. You people are imbiciles!

I will never buy a Funcom product again, not because of the bugs in this game BUT because you response to customer concerns has been so pitiful, indifferent and sometimes rude. I have never been so angry with any product I have ever bought. Don't you know you have dug your own financial graves?

Misophist @ 12/14/2001 4:29:31 AM (4084):
I'm almost tired of commenting on this. But hey, all I want for Christmas is... a fix for this silly bug!!

Yes, I play a martial artist, but I'd like to stress that this is also happening to other classes. I think overequipping helps a little, but um, we can't overequip fists (naturally) OR most weapons, due to the silly unequipping crap. 

It's a problem against human mobs, so you can try pushing the misison slider over to chaos to encourage monster mobs in missions -- you won't hit minimum against them. It doesn't guarantee 100% monsters all the time, but it helps.

Isisnorfret @ 12/14/2001 7:35:16 AM (3783):
LOL, c'mon now, this is an easy one.

The mob was doing Minimum Damage. Once you have enough AC to make a mob to Minimum Damage no amount of AC will make them do any less.

Now try taking your bsuit and taking a few hits from a red creature. Then try without the suit. You will notice.

(sidenote) Why would you use a Bsuit?

Ariana @ 12/14/2001 7:53:27 AM (Screwed Up Hanshi Primus Decus Armor Helmets.....grr 4106):
My friends and I fought our way through a mission to get me a Hanshi Primus helmet to match my coat....well I get the thing and here's it's description: Hanshi Primus Decus Armor Helmet   QL 131
required stats to use:  Agility from 357, Strength from 496

Um hello- 496?!?!? Even QL 150 elite armor does not require Str of 496!! Besides, if you notice in item descriptions the larger stat is always listed first. Well this obviously upset me and I wanted to find out what can be done about it. 

So I sent a petition and was replied to by an ARK (actually 2 ARKs ended up coming- maybe one was in training- I dunno) Anyhow, the ARK said that it was a bug in the description. The real Str was supposed to read as 296 or something like that...she said if I submit a bug report it will be fixed. Then the other (more senior?) ARK said that it can be fixed and I would be able to wear it...I even asked how quickly it could happen, and they told me that it happens pretty quickly....

It's now been a few days since I submitted my bug report and my helmet is still screwed up. I am just wondering how long this takes? Does anyone know? I mean it really sucks to spend like an hour and a half in a mission with your friends to get you a helmet and then you find out the item is screwed up and unequippable. Has anyone else had this probelm with this type of helmet and if so, has it been fixed and how long did it take to get fixed?

Alaysia @ 12/14/2001 8:00:56 AM (3982):
kodiene - i used to get this, but there were two variants:

a) if, for example, ur looking for a specific item, take a mission for it, then find another mission for the same item in a better place, delete the first and take the second, the mission/reward items would stay the same, but the location would change - havent seen this in a while now.

b) if ur browsing thru missions and u select one ( but dont press the 'accept mission' button ), then examine a different mission and hit accept, occaisonally the mission ur displaying would be assigned rather than the one u selected.  havent seen this one either for some time now, but what used to work for me is just making sure ur displaying the mission uve selected before hitting accept.  as u indicated, i only noticed the change after zoning.

the gm's/ark's arent gonna be able to help on this, as u were accidentally assigned a completely different mission; they cant recreate the original one u wanted, unfortunately.

Provisioner @ 12/14/2001 8:01:24 AM (3783):
Actually, I doubt it was the minimum damae rule.  We're talking about going from 50 AC to 2000 AC and having a mob so the exact same damage.

...and, I don't wear a battle suit.  I got it as a mission reward, and thought I would use it for this test 

Provisioner

Alaysia @ 12/14/2001 8:11:08 AM (4106):
fixed? no - it would take a database upgrade - and strangely, they just did one and the helmet is still the same.

actually, the helmet is multiply bugged: 

the senpai primus decus helmet displays ( in chat, etc. ) a normal agility req and a 496 strength req.  in actuality, the helmet has a normal agility req and a 10 sense req.

the hanshi primus decus helmet displays the same reqs, but does in fact require 496 strength.  short of buying a ql100+ carrier craft, most ppl arent getting this helmet on. 

i believe the split between senpai and hanshi is around ql100.

Krneki @ 12/14/2001 10:18:52 AM (3783):
I dunno about you or anyone that claims that AC doesn't work. I did a lil test today just for the hell of it. I'm lvl 47 and I have 1100 ac in melee. I got to some o----|----- Bio-X39 Public Enemy and had my armor on like I normally do. I engaged combat and the dmg he did was like : 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 34 3434 34 34 34. I stopped fighting him and executed calm on him. Then I took all my armor off and I had 0 AC in melee. I again engaged comabt and his dmg was like : 47 36 56 91 77 69 46 92 77 93 89 40 35 84.

That concludes my test and the results are obvious. I wouldn't dream of taking my 5100 ac off my lvl 144 Engineer. I'd be dead soooooo fast.

Problem with scooplets?
Im a fixer, and tough mobs is a problem for me, even yellow.
But if something makes me smile, its in fact scooplets, diglets and shovelets in missions. Why? Simply because they are easy to kill(no healing, no nanocasting, same damage all the time without crits or brawl or burst or other ****), and they give me good xp too. I cant handle 2 hunters, but i can for sure handle 2 shovelets! And i can even handle 2 diglets with some HoT and buffs

skybert @ 12/14/2001 12:07:36 PM (3458):
why not make it so omni-personnell do not get omni-alligned monsters (or NPC's)in missions, and clan-people do not get clan-alligned monsters (or NPC's) in missions?

just a thought....

I'm sure every nano programmer knows that if you combine a cluster into an implant sometimes the resulting implant increases in ql.  Example :  Put a ql 90 cluster in a ql 90 inplant and the resulting inplant may become a ql 91 implant:

Several months ago before many ppl posessed the skill to make or wear ql 200 implants, a terrible bug was found.  When combing ql 200 implants, if the implant attempted to become ql 201,202,203 etc... , the combined implant would become a ql 1 pair of pants, or a statue, or any other worthless ql 1,2,or 3 item.

This was devastating!  At this time, ql 200 implants were EXTREMLY hard to come by.  I personally know a programmer who sat for hours with gm's in game showing them this bug and trying in vain to get implants replaced.

thanks for clearing this up, hope they fix it soon!

Hossley @ 12/14/2001 2:47:46 PM (2768):
In a similar vein I've noticed that sometimes you get 4 or 5+ misses in a row against a Mob at any time during a fight. This is very frustrating, but moving so that the Mob has to move too can often make you start hitting again.

I've also noticed that if you're fighting a caster and it's down to almost zero health, you keep missing it and eventually it'll cast some nano or other and then you'll finally hit it and kill it. It's as though the server knows the Mob is dead but the nano cast has already been committed to on the server and needs to be displayed on the client before the death animation. I've got a sixth sense now for this "cast followed by death" scenario. Unfortunately the mob on the client can still keep hitting you for damage until that happens  (I haven't tried zoning from a mission after this to see if your health sync's upwards to where it should really be - may just be a client display issue).

Cheers,

Hoss.

PS Incidentally - does anyone know for sure if your client tells the server or the server tells the client if you are dead or not? Can you die via the health stats that your client thinks you have, or does it have to be the stats that the server holds for your health?

Tetra @ 12/14/2001 3:42:48 PM (broken nanocrystal creation process? 4149):
I found the data disk for Anima of unleashed malice (ql37), tells me to combine it with a symbol library.

did so and got the message
You combined "Symbol Library - Medical" with "Instruction Disc (Anima of Unleashed Malice)" and the result is a quality level 37 "Combiled Algorithm (Anima of unleashed Malice)".

So far so good, it's current description states "This is the fully linked nanobot coding for the nanoprogram anima of unleashed malice.  In this state it is unusable, and needs to be transferred into a nano crystal.  for this to be done the code needs to be moved from this quarkstor datadisk into a photon particle emitter, from where it can be encoded into a nanocrystal.  this is a tradeskill item".

trying to use a QL 55 photon particle emitter on it and vice versa gives the message "It is not possible to assemble these two items.  Maybe the order was wrong?"  which according to the book "how to create a nano crystal" along with description of both the particle emitter and the compiled data disk should combine.  I was able to combine it with a QL 65 photon emitter however without any problems.... now i just need to find a carbonrich rock =\

I was my fixer and I was hunting down this female soldier that had switched sides to omni.  I found and killed who I thought was her, but found out since she was in full armor and my Identifier wasnt working I had killed the wrong one.  I met her again in the Grid in plain clothes (I guess it made sense in my dream that everyone doesnt run around in armor all the time[edit]but we were in human form in the grid? DOH! hehe well, it was a dream after all[/edit])  and she never realized it was me, until I stupidly pulled out something that I had taken from her dead remains like a lighter or phone or something and she recognized it and proceded to ram us both into the closest exit and she had her armor appear on her with a click of a button (that seemed to make sense since it is 30,000 years in the future) and blasted me all to hell before I knew what was what.  I ressurected naked in the middle of Omni-1 for some reason instead of Tir and then I woke up.

I thought it was just me!!! Wow, I feel better knowing that other folks are experiencing the same thing. It's like during combat there's this long period of time in which I just don't seem to attack or I constantly miss.

Now combine that with the min. dmg. problem against bugged human super-AC mobs and you've got a really frustrating experience!

Zenithiclese @ 12/14/2001 6:12:41 PM (3458):
Here is something you an try to help yourself avoid scooplets.

Set your mission settings to full order. That should reduce the number of missions you get with non-human mobs. Of course, this will increase the number of human mobs in missions, and human mobs tend to be tougher per level than non-humans.

This way, you don't have to worry yourself with scooplets.

Glitche @ 12/14/2001 6:38:21 PM (Engineer Team buff bugs........ 4170):
Ok so I am out hunting in Pleasant Meadows last night, trying to get in a few levels before I log off, everything was going well until the complaints began.

    It isnt bad enough that the Sympathetic Shielding Barrier nano program, goes off every ten, but the text is  distraction to some players with it loading and reloading, but that is not the problem.

The problem is that when Agents conceal to use aim shot, the Sympathetic Shielding Barrier knocks them out of concealment everytime it reloads. Remind you it does this every ten seconds, I can see how that can be annoying.  

Since that was the first time I encountered that problem I joined another team with an agent and tested it on him.  Samething happened, it knocked him out of concealment.

Please fix this, how are team buffs suppose to be helpful when it does more damage than justice.

Crin @ 12/14/2001 6:55:04 PM (3458):
Here is a thought.

If Funcom can't seem to be able to list all the changes in the patch notes, how are they testing them? I mean what instructions are they giving to their internal testers about what to check.

Another thought:

Why can't we ever get an ETA on a change or fix? I'm a programmer and I always have to state an LOE (Level of Effort), which is the number of hours a change will take to code. Admittedly the LOEs are vague sometimes because you can never anticipate all the things that can go wrong, but I still give them a ball park estimate. If I say I'll add a new feature, my clients will know weather to expect it in a few days to in a few months.

The only answers I can come up with to these quest would mean that AO has a very rocky future ahead of it. I so hope I'm wrong.

King of Potato @ 12/14/2001 7:04:16 PM (Broken Pet 4176):

Or should it just be like that.

Vlados @ 12/14/2001 7:14:13 PM (Regarding Bugs 4177):
Why is it that the programmers from FunCom seems to add 3 buggs for every 1 they fix?

Is there a poll in FC that they bet on who makes the most bugs for the latest patch, and the one that does gets the poll?

Im not a programmer, but it seems that the bug list grows longer and longer and longer and looooonger for every patch that comes out, as well as making peps pissed due to "nerfs" without questioning them first.

How hard is it to fix one bug without creating many more?

godthe bugs!!!! @ 12/14/2001 7:47:34 PM (4177):
I love it man!

HEHE, thats programming for you.  I can tell you that its not that hard to break 5 things for everyone you fix.  It all depends on how closely you view the entire application in light of the changes being made.  I can imagine that being quite a task with the immense code base that they use for AO.  Hell, even on something relativly small like the application my company makes the programmers still can't forsee everything that thier one change touches.  it all depends on how deep into the code you have to get.  Well, thats the excuse they give me any ways when I do the QC on it and I find out that they finally fixed a major bug (YEAH!) but come to find out 2 things that were working before dont now (BOO!).


Not trying to defend Bugcom, but hey thats the facts.

peterrjg @ 12/14/2001 7:48:34 PM (4084):
It does indeed sound promising. Like I wrote on another thread somewhere, I remember seeing screenshots of MA's doing these awesome animations like roundhouse kicks and haymakers.

The animations *must* be in the game somewhere, but turned off. It's logical to assume this when you look at the fluid movements 80% of our /emotes do.

I can't agree re: Dimach. At level 50, my dimach does 580 odd. A level 50 trader/soldier/whatever has the potential to hit for this with a burst/fling shot. And burst recycles in what time? 

I'm not asking dimach to be recyclable every 30 seconds but please reduce it to say 10 minutes or so.

Or make my lovely green riposte skill actually do something. Right now, it "might" reflect 2 points of damage back to the mob. And it takes forever to recycle.

Why not make this skill equal to parry? Make it a "passive skill" i.e always up and it runs a check against riposte to see if we...err, riposted against the mob. With 5 green dodge skills, you'd think some of Jet Li would've rubbed off onto us

When Scooplets, Diglets and Shovelets appear in OMNI missions, there is a problem.

Yes, they're easy to kill. But Omnis don't get experience for them. And thus, a waste of time.

So that's the point of this thread.

If you're clan or perhaps neutral, this will mean nothing to you.

MAN! this just doesnt compute at all.  He is obvious superuber twinked as Nietya said, either that, or us fixers really are getting shafted.  I mean come on, how much of SD personality can you have to need to be that UBER?  Why dont people like this go play an FPS and use a godcode, cause its obvious they just want to oblitherate everyone without a chance of dying themselves so they can feel like they have a BD.  Or maybe not, maybe he just likes wasting/using(depends on POV) his money playing a game in a way that is contrary to the design because he is tired of regular FPS's and the way they operate and are setup and being a terror to everyone around him who isnt Uber at PvP is just a happy side-effect?  I am confused at some thought processes at work with some people.  Just curious is all.

Laeni @ 12/14/2001 8:53:36 PM (4177):
This is one heck of a complex game. And the more complexity you have, the more things there are that can break. I don't envy the programmers their job.

Isisnorfret @ 12/14/2001 9:40:06 PM (2768):
I have a su****ion of what aspect of game mechanics causes this. I remember back when I first started playing that if you were running you would still hit just as often as if you were standing still, but sometime recently (within the past month, its a fairly subtle change) they changed something in the coding so that you won't hit as much if you are moving. Well, this hit restriction seems to be screwing with us even while we are standing still. 

At medusas the other day I had the liesure of not being the tank and did some experimenting, I noticed that if I just barely tapped the foward or backward button after every swing, then I was able to get off a hit almost every time. If I just stood there, then I would miss several times in a row. Also, when I was moving  back and forth, on those times that I did miss the attack bar would slowly go back up and back down and then start over before I could swing again.

Also lag seems to be a factor, when we pulled the medusa up on top of the hill where the landscape is flat, I hit every swing no problem. Down in the hills where the fps drops, I start missing more and more.

Zaal @ 12/14/2001 10:24:45 PM (Could you make the loot make sense? 4188):
Just a thought really :

If a mob is hitting you with a Freedom Arm, why can't that Freedom Arm be looted off the mob?

I know this issue could be way deeper that this initial thought but that's all it is : a thought.

You should be able to generate missions that are your level x1 x 1.1 x 1.2 x 1.3 x 1.5 AND x 1.8.  At level 101, he should be able to GENERATE QL 180 missions but for some reason he is unable.

Baby dinosaurs (brontos) carry around piles of credits.  In fact, all animals do!

Heck, even the cities was a pleasure to roam.   I was so impressed with the gameplay, and the missions, wow the missions were cool.  Even had assassinate missions for omni players (Im clan) where you could track and kill them even in 75% zones.  

But then, I woke up and again wondered why i havent cancelled my acount yet, and remember that I used the 6 month pay plan, so im in till Feb 2002.   :/

When you do these missions you blitz them, i.e. you run like a bat outta hell and pray that you can find the item and pick it up just as 20 MOBs converge and beat the stuffing out of you ;-p  And if it doesn't work the first time, rinse and repeat until either you get it or you give up and reroll another mission for the same item.

Ok this is something i dont understand so help me out.  If i am not mistaken in the current patch FC made it so that the plane deequips back to your inventory.  Well the stange thing is. Is that i have 2 character level 53 soldier and a 21 NT.  My level 53 soldier has a level 30 yalm that does not deequip when zoning!  Ya ai know pretty cool right.  I dont believe the plance should de equip like it does on most players. Well i guess i am lucky it dont but on my other character the plane does deequip on my (level 21 NT).  My question is this.  Is FC going to fix this strange problem.  I mean how many times have you zoned and died cus there are aggro mobs  on the other side of the zone that you cant see.  The plane should not deequip. That's gay!  It not like i wanted to get out of the plane morph or fall from the sky if your high and the plane dequips.

Maybe when you raised the specific nano skill, it was affected by an ability-enhancing buff. When that buff the runs out, your nano-skill would drop one point. This happened to my MA the other day, I raised sensory improvement to 216, not realizing my muscle stim nano program, raising my strength by 12, affected sensory improvement as well, so when it ran out, my skill dropped to 215, without me realizing why at first.

Could this be the case for you too?

Misophist @ 12/15/2001 5:50:19 PM (4223):
I have a lot of sense/agi implants, and naturally high sense and agi -- this raises my air vehicle  quite a bit. My plane was deequipping during zone, so I followed the advice of another poster on these forums (thanks!).

I went to a place where I could zone safely, and with IP I saved from a level, I raised 1 point in air vehicle, got into my plane and then went into the whompa. The plane de-equipped, so I repeated raising AV a bit, zone -- and lo and behold, the plane now stays on when I change playfields.

It only took two clicks to air vehicle. Might be more for people who use air vehicle implants, but I think my agility and sense were both high enough that I was almost balanced out, anyway.

Tiran @ 12/15/2001 9:07:44 PM (943):
Might as well add in the 'since beta' bug that the location 'pips' for you, and any mission you're on, on the 'world map', are incorrectly placed.  Badly.

It rather looks like the map was originally larger, and when it was made smaller, the scaling for location wasn't changed.

Bones @ 12/15/2001 11:04:30 PM (4213):
good idea, but no. I use all the same buufs all the time. after a few hours, or a few deaths, whatever triggers it, I lose a point somehow.

Emmily @ 12/16/2001 2:39:58 AM (3234):
I have two friends in my guild that also have had this happen.  In the last two weeks, two people in my guild have had their Yamahas just disapear when they died.  Both players had room in their inventory, and neither had it in a bag.  Both players petitioned about it.  One player waited several hours for a response, and when a GM showed up he was told 'Sorry, if I had gotten here earlier then I would be able to check out the log and see if you had it.  I can't look it up in the log now, so I can't give it back.'  The other player (also having waited a few hours) was told that the log didnt show him having a Yamaha as far as it went back (it had been too long).  

Both players lost their Yamahas to bugs, and couldn't get it returned because FUNCOM took too long to answer their petitions!  One of the players may not be playing anymore because of it (he had spent forever saving and borrowed quite a bit from friends).  I think this is pretty screwed up, and I find myself wondering if the same thing will happen to me if I get killed.  I have a QL36 Yamaha I found in a mission chest a while ago, and I don't want to lose it to a combination of bug and poor service.  I have several screen shots saved of it, but I dont know if that will be acceptable proof.  Cozmik, What do I have to do to make sure that I can prove I own a Yamaha if mine gets lost to a bug.  Should I petition now so that I can have it logged that I own it?  It is a pretty serious question, Yamaha's are the most expensive item in the game.

Nozzzs @ 12/16/2001 9:12:58 AM (4213):
This has happened to me....I have raised skills and then for some reason been set back to the point before I raised the skill without having the IP returned.  Once I lost over 30 points in Mat Met...  I know this because I had just enough to use one nano for MANY levels..then one day i couldnt use it..very weird..

              Oh well...I just put the IP in again 
The one IP or maybe two is much more commmon.  I have no buffs beside general nanos (Traders have no pre-fight buffs except one..the one that uses Mat Met)

    So when I suddenly have one less in a skill is it glaringly obvious. 
  

     It could be related to some issue with other skills affecting it..who knows

Hehehe, so you've maxed out dimach and implanted yourself to hell, all to do 600 at 36...at the expense of what? True, I could blow IP and max mine to the 260 odd skill level or whatever it would be at 50 but I could name you a bunch of skills I put over and above dimach. Like evades, like nano resist, like run speed etc.

Bothead @ 12/16/2001 1:55:22 PM (3295):
Oh that's a good solution, just raise the skills using IP whenever an implant isnt working as intended...  THAT IS NUTS!   Flying implants not working when zoning is a bug, hence something Funcom should fix, and to my knowledge they are currently working on it.

Thanks for the constructive input

Redbow @ 12/16/2001 6:13:40 PM (Loosing Skillpoints when dying. 4295):
This is the third time this has happened to me.
Loosing skillpoints isn't usually something you 
discover fast, cause it is too much keeping
track of all of them.
I have sendt petition's about it those three times
i have discovered it, but so far they have not 
come up with an answer/sollution to what 
might help me.
Now... The last time i discovered it was just now.
I had sufficient Skillpoints in all but one line, MatMet.
When i died, i waited for 'Res' to finnish, got up, and
went back to my mission. When i tried to cast the 
buff i'm currently talking about, Venom Modification, 
I had too low skillPoints in SensImp as well. 
I had lost 4 skillpoints in SensImp. As i'm a fixer, 
these skillpoints cost's 600 IP per skillpoint. Thats a 
total of (not counting that it is growing per point)
2400 IP just for these points. 

Anyone got a clue?

When i have the need to play the game within a window, when i minimize and then bring the window back up, often the camera will be locked in one spot as i run off into the distance. Most of the time i need to shut down the client and restart it, although a few times sitting down, minimizing and maximizing again fixes it. Am i the only one with this bug?

Subtile @ 12/16/2001 9:46:37 PM ("Waiting for your special attack to complete' 4308):
As many others said, the game gets worse and worse with every patch. 

Patch 13.2 resulted in one very annoying bug (which I've reported *several times* to the forum, 'form' and with  '/petition' )

The bug is trivial to reproduce and it is still not fixed.

To reproduce:

Attack the MOB with, say 'burst'. When MOB get's closer, drop the gun and try to, say, 'brawl'.  It would say "waiting for your special attack to complete".  If somehow it works, try one more time. Usually it does not work. Last time I checked was 15 minutes ago.
Of course, this bug is not an exception. Well ... there are plenty of bugs in this code, but the situation with this one really annoyed me.

I've played for 3-4 months occasionally, I've got the level 35 (or 36, don't remember). With the recent changes ( no waste of  time running for missions just to get killed in the middle because of disconnect ) I think I could  make to level 70 solo - easily, but I've cancelled my subscription today.

I've cancelled the subscription, because I really don't understand why my ISP (who charges the comparable monthly fee) always responds to my bugreports, but the very special company Funcom assumes that they can afford ignoring the bugreports.

Also, I'm now confident that the longer you play, the less interesting it gets because of bugs in Funcom's code. This issue has been covered my many people so I would not repeat what have been said already, just wanted to confirm that:

1. Funcom does not give a **** about their customers.
2. I think that Funcom can not ship a playable game, because they don't understand how to write even virtually reliable  software. ( I can elaborate on this one, but anybody who've explored the backyard  should understand why Funcom sucks in programming. I'm  talking  about the "professional development" sign)

The guys are not professionals and they are proud of it. Well, 
you'l not get the money from me. I've cancelled the subscription and if I would know what a waste of time AO would be, I would not start playing it 4 months ago. 

It looked nice, it was my first online world, I like the genre, but it is time to find some better 'GSP' ( Game Service Provider ).

Also ... Where is the promised storyline? I'd say that it is notexistant. You say you have it? ... Wel ...  Unfortunately, I can not trust a word from Funcom, because of lies in technical press-releases ( "13.2 is has minor problems", sure ... and when sending my petition I realised that there are *hundreds* of petitions waiting in the queue... )

Don't lie, Funcom. This is just an advice.

Regards and good luck. You will need it.

I have the same problem with "waiting for special attack to complete"

However its not because I am changing a weapon..all I have is my mausser and my only special is burst ...it happens at least 3 times a day and you have to sit there as it cycles through again...

there doesnt seem to be any pattern to it occuring...just be in a fight hit burst and nothing happens...think ok I didnt click the button ill try again...and be greeted with that message...no burst damage is done to the Mob..they burst icon stays "available" but you cant burst

Going back to this thread subject here, i'll post a bit later today an url with screenies of all my lately min damages, maybe some funcom guy will be able to analyze this? (last time i spoke about this bug, someone asked me where? when? what level? blah blah) so there it'll come...

And fix SMG Kits!

Alias @ 12/17/2001 2:58:35 PM (4308):
I have also run in to this many, many times on a daily basis. I am not sure what causes it to happen either but it certainly is annoying. Waiting for previous special attack to complete...as far as I can see the previous special attack has completed and this is a new cycle and there seems to be no reason why it shouldn't work.

There is also another gun bug that I find is even worse. I have a lvl 128 soldier using a Nova Flow and if you are unfortunate enough to click on fling or burst just before the gun starts to reload you lose that special attack completely. What happens is you click the special and the button greys out and nothing happens then a few moments later you get the Reloading... message and you go thru the reloading sequence but now the special you tried to use is NOT available right after that. You have to wait for the timer to make it available again and if you are unlucky enough you can lose your special attack again on the next reload cycle.

At higher level's fighting a single mob can take quite a bit of time and your gun may go through 3 or 4 reloading cycles in a single fight. It's not hard to see that the chances of losing a special attack in almost every single fight are very high. And with Burst being so gimped already with it's high chance of doing no more damage than a single regular shot as it is this bug really needs to be looked in to.

I also have a question, maybe someone can answer. Using a gun that holds 20 rounds and is fully reloaded before the start of a fight. I hit attack then use burst and then fling right away and then I get Reloading... How on earth can it be empty if I ony fired off 5 maybe 6 shots? Burst is supposed to be only 3 shots, and having used one single regular shot and then fling which is also one round only adds up to 5 rounds fired. Is this also a bug or am I missing something here?

it's gone...forever!

Maximilian @ 12/17/2001 4:29:45 PM (4358):
Hi Borrace,

I wished, nobody else would have been hit by this one, but I am really sorry to see you posting here.


*** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert ***

Until fixed, NEVER, EVER 'right-click' with a weapon (pistol) at your mouse cursor on another weapon (wielded) that uses the same type of ammo (?)(e.g. exchange of weapons of the same type). The system interprets this as manual loading and deletes the weapon afterwards - gun lost. 

*** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert *** Bug Alert ***


Although a friendly GM answered my petition I (naturally) got no replacement - these are the moments to take a deep breath. I took me two weeks of continuous screening in the shops to get this one - futsch (grrrr).
All in all it was 'only' a ql76 Khemo-Tech Model 200 (~80k), but there were times, these were really rare in the (neutral shops). I was not asking for a Yal or such a biggy, just a medium ql Pistol (!!!, hear Pistol, I am one of this RP freaks, dual wielding Adventurer).
So, enough stress reduction for this one. As I am strictly for equal treatment to all, I don't mind in the end. But nevertheless, my blood pressure went up significantly. And, I was not aware of any note here on the boards, that I should be careful while trying to change weapons.
Ehh, btw. these are the things that make the occasional player quit (two marks on my list so far).

So long,

Max(imilian)

my dimach takes circa 10 minutes to recharge with the skill at 267, meaning i can usually kill 2-4 mobs with it during a mission. I only use it when I would be dead otherwise, and in 9 cases out of 10 it saves my ass.
The recharcge time reduces quite a bit when the skill rises... I remember having to wait for at least an hour at levels 5-10

Yep.. me too.. something interesting though, I am currrently breed maxed on my attributes (480) this is where I notice it a lot. I will occasionally login to find that I have dropped a point but am still breed maxed on that attie.. wierd little bug. Seems to be random in that the next time I log in, I am back to normal. Not sure if its a visual only effect or if its really gone. I will check it next time it happens to see. 

Anyone else notice this?

hah... wow thought i was the only one....

yea it happened to me once ...  a while ago... since then i haven't noticed it happen again. 

i reached my requirement for using my flurry of blows and then the next day i logged in and i wasn't able to use it... it said i didn't reach the requirements.... I put back all the buffs i normally have on and still it didn't let me .. i was like 1 or 2 short. I had no more spair ips to put it in... so i was like " wierd" ... i could of sworn i had enough ips... 

after i logged that day... i logged on the next day ... buffed myself up again... tried using flurry of blows.. and yup .. ips were back!

Lwiz @ 12/17/2001 10:31:31 PM (MA special attacks dont requires line of sight ? 4399):
Not that I dont like killing Red things thrue the walls. But with the bad pathfinding of large monsters (bloodreapers in my case) I can stand next to a wall and kill them thrue the wall, not that I dont think we MAz dont need a hand 

Now I can respect all the errors in the MA attacks for now, heck half of them dont work as they should - but this is looking like a thing that could be heavily exploited. Hell I killed 5 of these babies (DEEP RED and nasty at my level) thrue the wall. Granted you have to get a mission with them (Chaos setting).    Now when you do get around to fix the MA attacks, perhaps this is a little something that need to be taken into consideration ?
Now I wont actively exploit this, but as I see a potential for an exploit perhaps there should be a small fix for it in next patch, and a hand for the MAz as well ;D

hratgard @ 12/18/2001 1:01:04 AM (QL200 Implants 4422):
Hi.
This is a bug that concerns highlvl players, and might be a reason none of the ARKs I've spoken to have ever heard about it, nor know what causes the bug. 

Well I know what the bug is, and what causes it.

As every higher lvl Nano-Programmer(aka NPer) in Rubi-Ka, I've encountered some rather strange things with the top end ql implants, ql200. 

Lets say I have a ql200 basic head, and a ql200 Shinning MC cluster. I try to assemble this, and I will get a notice saying : You can't assemble this, it requires xxx Nano Programming skills. (can't remember the exact skill req). This is all fine. 
Now I have a qlright hand, and a shining Weapons Knowledge cluster, I assemble it just fine, get 1k xp for the job etc. Then I want to add a Bright cluster of Matter Creation to teh same hand. While trying to do this nothing happends, the cluster is not assemble, I get no warning telling me I dont have the right skill, or that the implant is in wrong order (dont fit with this cluster). Clearly I should be able to make this, my skills are way higher then the req, and the cluster should fit in the arm. 
Now, if I /terminate, such that my skills are lowred, or get a newbie, er.. sorry, a lower level player, to try and asseble my implant, I/the newbie, will get a notice saying that it requires around 600 (most bright clusters around ql200 requires 600ish skills, 400-500 ish for faded). So if I now give the implant to a NPer with skills that are around the requirements of the implant assembling (of corse he have more then the require ment, but not more than 60 or so more then req) this player will be able to make it. OR I can wait til my ressurection effects have been worn out so much that my own skills are around the requirements, THEN I can make the implant. 

Ok that was an explaination of the bug, and a work around.... I hope the /terminate workaround isnt defined as an exploit, as I SHOULD be able to make this implant even whitout this workaround.

And now the reason for the bug.

When assembling an implant its all about the nano programmers skills, and not the cluster ql. For a QL200 implant you need a ql172 Shining, 168 Bright and a 164 Faded cluster. Any higher ql clusters is just a waste, as they make no difference. But if the NPers skills are high enough, the implant's ql will increase during a assembling. As you know most ql125 (stor bought) implanst will be ql127 after assembling. This is if the NPers skills are high enough. This is all fine. And its means that a ql198 basic implant is just as good as a ql200, as it will most likely be ql200 after assembling. 
The problem is, IF the implant is ql200 already, and a highly skilled NP tries to install another cluster into it, the algorithms for cluster assembling tries to increase the ql of the implant, and thereby increasing the ql to an and unacceptable lvl, as you cant have implants over ql200. This is why we need to /terminate/find a low lvl player to make the implant. As low enough skills will ensure that the implant stays ql 200, and therefor it can be made.

I know this might be a bit late, but get a fix for this into wednesdays patch will ya 

Its getting a pain in teh A##! hehe

Hratgard


NB: A fix for this is all about one single IF statement in your code  IF QL200 then.. :P

Serena @ 12/18/2001 6:58:40 AM (4358):
This happened to me once, a couple weeks later after visiting the reclaim I noticed it ghosting over/under the one it was replaced with. This was after dying and re-equiping my stuff on the way back to the fight, I right clicked to wear it and  poof gone, of course I got the usual story sorry we can't do anything about it. Well after a little fiddling and another reclaim visit.. (suicide) I managed to get ahold of the bugger and put it in my inventory before I did anything else.

It seems its still equiped but somehow the game loses it on your character.

Soft Felon : orange, minimal damage
Rookie Lookout : orange, minimal damage
Rookie Rustler : green (woohoo) , NORMAL damage
At this stage i was persuaded that green guys = ok, higher = min damage but....
Soft Felon : orange, minimal damage
Soft Felon : light yellow, NORMAL damage
Rookie Disavowed medic : ORANGE, NORMAL damage (hu???)
Soft Techwrecker : ORANGE, NORMAL damage (hu???)

I though i found a patter while hitting all oranges for min damage, but the last mission prooved me wrong. But anyway, Dont know who asked for those informations, but here they are. I got them all "screenshotted" if needed...

Krneki @ 12/18/2001 9:07:24 AM (4422):
Lots of things work that way, so i don't think a fix will be here so soon. For example, If you try to make an increase aggressiveness trimmer of a lower QL...you get a chemical injector QL 20 and a XU-serum QL 18, you combine them fine and get a QL 20 injector. Then you get a QL 25 Trimmer Casing and try to combine those 2 and.....crap! It doesn't work...no error msg or anything. That's all because the trimmer u'r trying to make doesn't exist below QL 30. Same thing happens in the nano crystal creaton, but not in weaponsmithing (well it can, but It clearly says in the manual what QL the construction kit must be that the correct combination will work, assuming that is not screwed up, which in most cases it is).

If the QL of the item you'r trying doesn't exist, there will be no error msg or a warning b4 you even try to assamble the 1st part. Anyway, I hope they will fix it soon, but I don't count on it.

Yea, they work just fine if you have a 6th slot belt, which happens to be the requirement.

Watch out for this one:

Do NOT right click on a weapon (Pistol) with another one (that uses the same type of ammo). This happened to me, while trying to exchange (left click) my wielded weapon against a higher ql one. The weapon attached to your mouse cursor is considered as ammo and will vanish afterwards (reload bar and message).
Actually there is NO-replacement policy - so it will be lost.

Situation:

Ma vs anyone, initate battle, punch(blah blah) then incomes SHEN, bang the oppenent dies he then appears at reclaim, dies again(wtf?) and again and again and again and again, about 6 times.

This all occured when the oppenent was saved in the same zone as where the battle took place, i am not sure if it nulified when you are saved in a differenet zone, but it is quite possible that it isn't. Please fix this it is exremly irrataing.

This is really a very old problem the exact same thing happens with Blessed with thunder (shens little brother) But fear not BWT more commonly refered to as cursed with thunder is up for nerfing very soon.

Emitter @ 12/18/2001 4:26:05 PM (Motivational speech bugged 4492):
Atm no crats are using the new Motivational speech nanos. For two reasons. 
1. They spam the chat with messages when it's recasting itself automatically... and teammembers ask me to shut it down.
2. They interrupt casters nanos. The nano wil automatically cast a "sub-spell" on friendly targets in the sorounding area that will last 21 seconds, then it'll be refreshed etc. Everytime it refreshes the "cast-nano-bar" in the left upper corner will take a run. This prohibits other players (and your self) casting nanos, while its casting and recharging. Although its a quick spell, it still annying, especially since its every 20th second. So when a NT thinks he's casting a root, he's actually not. He's already casting a nano you see. The problem is that it counts as though they are casting the nano temselves. It shouldnt be that way. 
and ... team members ask me to shut it down.

Heya @ 12/18/2001 4:41:50 PM (Describe item missions 4493):
I recently picked up a few describe item missions.
The settings where:
Bad
order
stealth
money

So after alot of camping i managed to get 2 missions with decent reward one augmented nano armour cloak and one senpai secundud decus armour cloak.
I was extatic that i finally found 2 coats that could bring me a few million creds.
The missions where 50% so i could get throug them without dying 50 times.
But when i finally find the items mission gets completed but lo and behold NO coat! In either of the mission!

WTF is up with that?

Zaal @ 12/18/2001 5:32:00 PM (4450):
I am of the opinion at this point that the minimal dmg bug is only there for people who don't or can't use overequipped weapons.  When and if they do the IP reset and the balance fix that lowers the effectiveness of over equipped weapons to near what they should be using at their skill level AND roll the monsters to lower stats for what they should be at their levels that the minimum dmg bug may go away all by itself.

Blame the over-equippers.  I do.

I only have one comment for funcom.  I'm > < this far from quitting, the only thing that has kept me from quitting was the fact that I was able to purchase a yalhama and see the AO world in a new light.  It actually made the game fun, instead of tedious.

If for some reason, I should lose my yalhama due to a game bug/crash/database error, I expect my account cancellation and refund request to be processed in a timely manner.  Dark Ages of Camelot looks better every day I read the forums here.

Same here Funcom,

If you don't start giving people back "any" or there items because of the bugs you have in your code I quit!... Honestly ... its not our fault your programmers make mistakes and don't think of possible situations in the flow of the game and then we lose countless hours of invested time by losing an item...

Its not our fault your beta test team does not catch all the bugs.. (even though most of us are the beta test team)

I don't know why you released this game they way you did, basically your digging your own grave if your not 100% devoted to  us.. and yes you will always have those players that will play no matter what.... but think about all the money you could make if you put more thoughts and resources into the proper areas..

If I lost my Yalmaha, I would quit instantly because I want to have enjoyment from a game.. NOT STRESS!!! (HELLO THERE!! KNOCK KNOCK!)

I agree, it was the first time in months of playing that I had an EQ flashback - TRAIN TO ZONE!!!!

We were holding our own in the first few rooms when a high-lvl Atrox MA came running up to the entrance and zoned out leaving a large group of high level mobs to kick the snot out of us before we could exit.  It made me really grateful for the privacy of missions where no one else can show up and ruin it for you.

Sathar @ 12/18/2001 9:22:59 PM (Is that a rollerrat in your pocket... 4516):
Probably a known bug, but I've only seen it the past couple of weeks.  A trap goes off on a chest, big explosion graphic, but no damage, no blind, no Earth-shattering kaboom.  Just, one rollerrat.  That's all.  Usually orange to me.  Kinda cute.  Doesn't attack me.  Seems to accept Pet commands, but just ignores them.  Won't even follow me.  I think I understand the thought, but I'm pretty sure this isn't the intended result.

I don't believe it to be a bug considering in your chat window you'll see the following:

A rollerrat wakes up!

I think maybe the idea is for it to roam around and attract the attention of other mobs perhaps ... not sure as it usually just stays in the room that it spawned in.

It's a cute diversion from the standard bomb-go-boom-hurt-you trap.

zeroframerate @ 12/18/2001 10:52:45 PM (4450):
Calling the problem the "minimum damage bug" is, to me, a misnomer honestly.

What is happening is that Funcom has acknowledged that certain human mobs have insane AC levels and that's why you're hitting for minimum damage against them. Now, it's not going to happen with all human mobs, just certain ones.

That looks like it explains what you're experiencing.

Sathar @ 12/18/2001 11:18:30 PM (4516):
Perhaps.  It doesn't even do that, though.  I'm sure having a MOb pop out of a chest is intentional.   It's just that it doesn't actually _do_ anything.  Nada. Zip.  It is cute, though.

Salazar @ 12/18/2001 11:18:36 PM (I want my loot !!!! 4530):
I know this is not a major bug, but it is down right annoying. There I am risking my life to kill mobs and when I do and get the "you may now loot" message I expect to be able to do just that.
But when I try I just get the "you may not loot this" message.
Now by trying from many different angles I can usually manage to loot the bodies, but this should not be so difficult to do. I killed it, it tells me I can, but when I try I cant. Usually I have to run past the body while clicking on it to get it to work.
Sometimes I cant loot before the body vanishes, or get attacked by other mobs while trying to loot.
I can sometimes spend as long trying to loot the body as I did killing it in the first place.

Come on, how hard is it to fix this bug ?

Scorus @ 12/18/2001 11:42:06 PM (4516):
I'm betting that it is supposed to attack you. Since it is orange, that could be real trouble for some players.

hobbes @ 12/18/2001 11:57:53 PM (4516):
It won't attack you as it is a "scared rollerrat". I assume its purpose is to be a pet for those who have those abilities. It does nothing for me except report its location. I tried to draw a mob into the room with the rollerrat to see what it would do, but no luck.

Has anyone one gotten one to do anything?

Thyrra @ 12/19/2001 12:03:28 AM (4516):
same thing here, it reports; that's about it.

i hope it gets quasi-normal non-combat pet abilities.  it would make looking for chests more fun if u get to have a pet for the duration of the mission.  the next step would be to take it home with u and raise it like a virtual pet thingy.

Flupper @ 12/19/2001 12:22:23 AM (3594):
Hmm, i cant see it.
I have gone there in a group where we where 5 ppl. 3 MA's a NT and an agent i think. all level 45 - 55. The mobs wasnt realy that tough until we arrived at that pesky neleb. And the only reason we didnt kill him was because we didnt have anybody to cast debuff on him. So i dont think its too tough!!!

We was beating on him for 10 minutes until we gave up and allowed us self to get killed. Several of his minions even spawned again while we where beating on him

I think the key is pulling the right way and having a team that can work together.

Might not be that exciting a dungeon, but that another matter 

But its something to make a trip out of. If you are lower level you want to be 2 full teams i am sure.

Just my 2 cents.

Icaria @ 12/19/2001 12:31:09 AM (943):
This may be old news to some and forgotten as it becomes automatic but if all of a sudden things don't work (like self healing, nano boosts, meds, etc) try hitting the escape key a couple of times and re-target yourself <F1>.

This has probably been brought up before but I don't want to page through this entire forum to check (sorry but I have a final to study for). Leaving Athens (green I think, the west one) from the west door takes you to an alternate dimension, similar to the real world but uninhabited. You can see the door but can't go back. You can get back into the real world by zoning, the way I have found so far is by going around the city till you get to where the wall around blue should be, it is not there. You go in, through where the gare to red should be, across the zone heading toward the entrance to Green, a short way from the arch you zone and appear as if you entered Red from Green.

Xombie @ 12/19/2001 5:18:17 AM (4540):
yeah... don't hold your breath. The engine doesn't support that.
It takes special animation system to do that, and AO doesn't have it in its engine.

Nah, there's no claim the initial hit will be larger, just that the DoT will be nerfed to the minor damage it was 'supposed' to be.  Max of 40 every 10 seconds, for a QL 200 BwT.  10, at QL55.

I personaly dont consider it over equiping when you rebuff your skill.... Over equiping is when you use something you dont have the skill to use! Let me tell you why casters cant Ov. Equ. there arnt any buffs that increases the skills neede for nano armour and strength and stamina are dark blue if your a homonano, you would have to waiste a LOT of IP to over equip as a caster homonano(which they realy cant afford sins the nanobreed realy lacks health and speed, they are both dark blue skills)...
I use nao formulas that I need to buff upp to use and that is not over equiping because when I buff upp I do have the skill to use it! If the buffs were ment to work beond the timelimit they would do that for all profs! Read the news on the official site and you will see that FC considers Ove. Equi. a bug or exploit or whatever...

Sathar @ 12/19/2001 2:58:55 PM (4516):
Well, since a trap releases it, I would assume it's intended to be hostile (or at least reasonably aggresive).  The pet option is a nice thought, and would be kinda cool, but still not what I'd expect.  Either way, it should probably do something.

Taldrin @ 12/19/2001 3:09:06 PM (Mission rewards 4607):
Just a quick question FC...

Is it intended that 99.9% of mission rewards are always clothes or useless implants?

When doing a lvl 100 mission it's guaranteed that out of the 3 mission options I get there is always some item of ql1 clothing! Why the heck would I spend hours doing a hard mission only to get an item of clothing worth 10 credits? 

It gets really annoying when you're searching for an item you really want and all that turns up are clothes, implants, and the odd NF.

hobbes @ 12/19/2001 3:19:50 PM (4516):
Scared animals run, but cornered animals fight. But, to be honest, the reason I said they don't attack is that you cannot attack them, therefore; they are either your ally or just neutral. I have encountered about 20 of these things and never been attacked. I have tried to attack them but I get a message saying I can't.

I suspect this "bug" as you call it is nothing more than clientside lag and/or glitch that doesn't update the mobs exact location but it knows that you are able to hit it and be hit by it.  As an NT I find it dinconcerting because more often than not I can see a mob clearly but it will tell me "No line of sight".

Zaal @ 12/19/2001 11:16:38 PM (1951):
Templar Red, you're on crack.

NT's with PvP titles get their titles the hard way - by being sneaky and not fighting fair.  Some may have even zonecampsed for them - who can say really?  We can't win in a "fair" challenge type fight.  We have to sneak attack and HOPE our first cast hits for as hard as it can.  at lvl 62 i can cast a nuke that MIGHT hit for 1200 but more often than not hits for 700-800.  THAT takes 9.5 seconds to throw.  And ask me how often it freaking fumbles.

Now, I don't PvP cause of the overequippers.  And I don't want to PvP until it gets more balanced in terms of PvP.  My PvM game is slowly going down now... once I hit lvl 50 I had to start reducing the overall toughness of the missions (now at 40%) in order to insure my survival.  At 50% i would get taken down by one yellow easily or two greens.  Even two greys woudl make me zone out of a mission area once or twice.  Two greys.  As an NT I should be able to cook them just by glaring at them.  PvM is OFF because of overequippers and what they do in PvP.  

I'm hobbling along the best I can but if they don't fix the overequipping problem no but PvPers will be left and they might as well remove all wildlife from Rubi-Ka and rename the game Quake Rubika Online.

Lwiz @ 12/19/2001 11:39:51 PM (4399):
Well, after re-reading my posting a few times I may have forgotton to stress one thing. I can hit them thrue a wall, but the attacked creature DOES NOT target me nor attack. We are talking me killing a deep red bloodreaper thrue a wall without getting a single hit from it -  and this is not a one time event, I can repeat this trick if I want   <----- thats why I think it might be a bug, and it can be exploited.
Now MA attacks dont require Line of sight, if a reapers leg is sticking out of a wall, happen often, then U can target it and start MA attacking it to death without risk at all. If you run around with a A-2000 Elite, you can get it locked into places where it will stop attacking (mostly on corners) and you can MA attack it to death. This is free XP, at very low risk - you just try to hang it on a corner, if you succed U kill it - else U zone heal and try again.

In a standup fight I would not be able to take these critters out, due to the minimum damage bug and the fact that MAz does way low Meele damage in high lvls. So yes it is a concern to me, tempting to do   and an exploit of a bug in my eyes.

I'm encumbered with 148kg (after putting everything I don't really need into my bank account) and summing up all items I shouldn't have a weight higher than 20kg. I now found out that treatment and nano kits get a weight when put into a bag. They don't have a weight when put into the normal inventory. Other items seem to work fine, although not 100% sure about that. Definitely a bug here!

Heya @ 12/20/2001 4:54:13 PM (4765):
I belive that this bugg is something similar to the ma sword bugg that has been around since beta.
Whenever your ma skll changes for some reason debuff or buff you will stop hitting with fists.
The only workarond is zoning.

Subject IV @ 12/20/2001 8:05:01 PM (Weapon Kits still broken 4871):
I have an Amytlo construction kit still stuck at stage 3: it won't take the Optimized Co-weapon Interface.

The kit is QL60 and the component that won't insert is ql 73. Is the 10% rule now above as well as below the construction kit?

All of the new trade shops are awesome, but only so much as whether the kits will work or not.

Misophist @ 12/20/2001 8:21:10 PM (4450):
and this still isn't fixed. Not even a brief mention. 

I've been pretty vocal about this problem, but I'm beginning to wonder if I've wasted my breath.

Yes, it's caused by certain MOB's high AC. That was supposedly fixed a while ago. But um, no, it's still there.

And YES, those folks who severely overequip do not see a big difference in damage output. You don't hear them complaining.

So it's a shame for people like me who refuse to use weapons (until they work right) and depend on fist damage which cannot be overequipped.

Pretty damn depressing.

If the playfield is closed mabey they should block the doors out that way, I spent a half hour trying to find a way back, didn't know how long it would take an ark to get there so didn't want to bother petitioning unless I was sure I couldn't get out on my own.

Scorus @ 12/20/2001 9:13:31 PM (No Healing Bug 4882):
All, 

The more I play the more this bug looks to be a serious problem. Suddenly you will not be able to use any treatment kits, nano rechargers, or first aid kits. Healing via nanos still works. Sitting, standing, running, walking, Esc-F1, all do not help. The only fix seems to be zoning and that is not always possible when hunting. It has happened to me both indoors and outdoors. Most if not all the times that I have been hit with it I was running away from someone or something (I'm a crat, we run a lot). So it might be triggered by hitting the first aid kit while running or something? I know there was a bug a while back where the first aid or nano restorer wouldn't kick in until you stopped running/walking. 

One other person mentioned that they had experienced this. Anyone else? 

Note: this bug was new (to me, at least) to 13.4 and is still here after today's patch.

Scorus

JFlack @ 12/20/2001 10:19:55 PM (4882):
I had this exact same problem happen to me while in a mission under 13.2.  The only difference was that I couldn't get out of the mission -- it kept saying something along the lines of "The server did not register zone transition.  You have the choice of staying put or trying again."  -- Ge thanks.

I thought it was a client lag problem, but my pings were in the 100-200 range (DSL).  I think it means the server and client are out of synch, because after ~5 minutes of waiting, it suddenly started working again.

ZeRo X @ 12/21/2001 12:22:07 PM (double the loss, no more health 4984):
I know that the chances of chain healing mobs were reduced or taken out, but what about chain funneling mobs?  Countless times ive run into trader npcs that cast a weapon skill siphon, which amazingly seems to stack with their weaker version, so in losing half of my weapon skill I miss about 50% of the time, doing little damage.  This gives them the chance to chain funnel your health.  Whats the deal?

Sathar @ 12/21/2001 2:00:36 PM (Grrr... 4987):
MObs are still running while rooted.

The first melee deep orange in the front room kindly calm-root-nuked like he was supposed to.

The second melee deep orange was at 39.8 meters (i.e. inside melee range), but at least he would calm-nuke-nuke-calm reasonably well.

Guess what the third melee deep orange did when root "Nanoproram executed sucessfully" came up 2 or 3 times.  No, I didn't receive a "Countered" message, and at least twice the root graphic showed up while he was running.

And no, I didn't think I had the mission difficulty high enough to deserve three oranges in the first room, but I just try to cope with what's thrown at me.

Oh, and now I lock my desktop 50% of the time when zoning (never even made it back to the Reclaim terminal).

ZenBeck @ 12/21/2001 4:20:31 PM (Starting attack failed 4996):
This is another one that should be on the top of the list. 

If Im puller in a group every now and then I just can not attack a MOB. Sometimes if I take my gun off, target a team mate, attack (message:cannot attack team mate), hit ESC, put my gun back on its fine. (but a HUGE PITA) Then sometines like last night no matter what I do I can not attack. 

again...ETA????

zeroframerate @ 12/21/2001 4:27:35 PM (4882):
I can't stand this bug. Very nerve-wracking especially when you're fighting a mob ... and that mob can heal no problem.

zeroframerate @ 12/21/2001 4:39:23 PM (Adventurer mobs over-powered! 4997):
Combine the following:

1. BUG: AC of certain human mobs is waaaay too high. Funcom has acknnowledged this one.
2. BUG: Certain human mobs (like adventurers) can stack nano programs such as damage shields which easily hit you for 25+ damage 3 to 4 times a second.
3. BUG: First-Aid/Nano kits sometimes do not work at all!
4. GAME MECHANIC: MDAs do nothing but melee damage.
5. GAME MECHANIC: Dimach damage is pitifully low considering Flings and Bursts do as much or even more for other professions ... and they can do both with much less recharge time.
6. GAME MECHANIC: Mobs have more health and nano pool at the same level.

And you've got some unkillable human mobs!

Funcom, please look into this problem. I'm begging you. Many 50% missions are unsolveable due to certain human mobs that break the rules become more powerful than they should be!

I don't mind a challenge, but the word challenge implies that it is doable. This isn't a challenge. These are bugged human mobs.

megaram @ 12/21/2001 6:25:22 PM (4308):
I found that if you use a "special" attack and see the damage hit the mob, but nothing is displayed on your window... this is the bug that starts it.

Workaround: don't do anything... for a bout 1-2 seconds and you char. will then do it's "special" (no added damage) but the bug is gone at that point. It pretty much seems to be a sync issue in my opinion.

Oberan @ 12/21/2001 7:00:29 PM (4997):
MA (martial artist) mobs are overpowered because they have high skill buffs and combined with very high evades (and their buffs) and their criticial buffs hit for very high amounts of damage very quickly and very often

MA mobs must be made less powerfull

(and yes this is a counteractive whine)

Adventurer mobs CANNOT stack damage shiled but soldier mobs often cast a reflect shield on them which does stack

i never accept pay cash to FUNCOM!

zeroframerate @ 12/21/2001 7:13:31 PM (4997):
MA mobs? You can't be serious. MA mobs don't have the AC bug and act accordingly (nano proggies don't stack, etc.).

Adventurer mobs have the AC bug. Adventurer mobs DO stack damage shield nanos. No, it's not a soldier's nano because the two give different damages and it's noted differently in the chat window. This is solely the adventurer's stacked damage shield only.

inanout @ 12/21/2001 7:33:19 PM (4997):
Yes that is abug which has to be worked out... SOmetimes I can do everything in a mission then all of a sudden I can not heal, sit and heal, or loot mobs...I have to run out side then it works..... Ok now that I did that I lost my current map of where i was in the mission. So either fix the in mission heals of make the map readable even after you zone out then in.

LOL, besides the updates from the GMS I was cracking up on the things the posters were saying:

"And if you want to be a smart ass with him about saying 'Diamach is a Soul Attack and it exhaussts your body', ask him to look into a martial art called Kook Sol Wan. KSW uses the techniques of focusing chi from your chi box into huge attacks. I've seen my roommate (a 2nd degree blackbelt in KSW) shatter glass bottles by barely touching them... and he could sure do it more often than every 30 minutes. " 

Does this guy have any idea? Anyone watch the UFC? Pride? All karate, LLama Kung Fung fighters get owned by grapplers and wrestlers.

Noticed this happens every time i die:
Inventory shows all items, but when i put em on the bar, they show the icon of the item, but its NOT the item it is!
Then when i try to shuffle the bar again, it changes the icon to correct one.
This was especially annoying with items like first aid kits etc, coz when i thought i used it, i was in fact clicking something entirely else. One example was it turned out to be the monster part in my inventory, or a blister pack.. ARGH
Is the inventory really such a #%!#¤% difficult issue to fix????

Gil-the-Arm @ 12/22/2001 2:28:19 AM (Bug with overflow 5063):
Dunno if this has been reported yet, but if you have an overflow window open and another overflow window pops up (in my case, doing tradeskills) the second overflow will dissapear... I don't know if it's in a bank or anything, I haven't checked yet... I was using a precious metal thingy on a bracelet, had 1 gold ingot in 1 overflow window, used the precious metal thingy on a second, I got the exp, lost the bracelet, but I diddn't ge the ingot

Gil-the-Arm @ 12/22/2001 2:30:23 AM (5063):
Also, I don't think the tradeskill departments sell the personal furnaces for burning ingots, they are still in the normal old toolshops.

Gil-the-Arm @ 12/22/2001 2:47:36 AM (5063):
also, when you use a wiredrawing machine on a piece of gold, you get both the wire and a gold ingot back - but the gold ingot isn't usable

Tal Cerav @ 12/22/2001 3:09:07 AM (4871):
I'm having the same problem with the executioner, as well as the Santiago Crossblade, the cheap fiddle rifle, and some other rifle I can't recall the name of right now.  In fact, the only weapon I was able to complete was a ql 6 luxembourg inferno rifle.  all others have failed, following the recipie eventually leads to being told, "maybe the order was wrong?"

Yes, we really need to get this noticed.  Please, someone at Funcom listen.  


To make matters worse the khemo tech ex can only be found above ql 80 and crossblades can only be found below ql 40.

I really want one of these weapons but without the trade skill portion working there is no way.  Also what's up with the multi meele req on the Khemo tech?  It does about the same dmg as a ot sword, and it does not have fast attack or sneak attack but a ql ~80 has a multi meele req of ~800+

bleh @ 12/22/2001 4:49:00 AM (Bugs, New and Old (as of 13.5) 5074):
Backpacks and Inventory shuffling about *still*. Inven hasnt worked properly since i started way back in June.

Small backpack is full, i buy a medium backpack, i transfer from small to medium, and am told medium bag is full whilst there are 3 items are still left in small pack.

Get agro'd whilst in car, from then onwards cannot get out of car, use kits, cast spells, attack, etc etc until i zone.

Agro on doc's is way over the top. Im spending all night being frenzied by mobs, who refuse to taunt off even unto death.. someone does 100% of damage to a mob and it completly ignores them whilst chasing me? This frenzy is caused by a heal or 2, or even the tick of regen from our long term hp buff. Its more or less making the game unplayable,  as its just not any fun grouping and doing PvE vs more than a single mob.

Message spam. Im getting messages off every single "tick" of a regen buff or HoT. If someone gives me a regen buff or humidity extractor etc i get spammed with messages telling me how much i nano/hp i get back. When grouped with a team every 30 secs i get spammed with regen messages. If using HoTs it fills the screen, if someone is buffing me too the chat window is almost unintelligble.

Game crashes alot when starting. Need to End Task Anarchy.Exe several times before i finally get in.

It doesnt remember that ive turned OOC off.

When travelling outdoors, even with all view distances maxed, mobs are drawn 10-20ft in front of me. When chased, mobs barely visible behind me will be hitting with melee damage.

Nitsche @ 12/22/2001 6:20:02 AM (It's just like I remember it... 5079):
Six months means little change in AO for me. 

I originally bought AO after Beta testing it and absolutely loved it during Beta. It seemed stable and though it was bugged, that was to be expected...it was a beta! Well, when the game came out and the first month was so fubared that I couldn't do a thing in game, I left and went back to my old haunts.

Buying it so I could play from day one was my first mistake...

Six months or so go by and I get this neat little email from FunCom saying they were going to give me a free month! I thought the idea was great and found my disk after much searching, moving is a real b*tch, and reinstalled it.

I think that was my second mistake.

Well, I start up a new character even though my others were there so I could try something new. Bearucrats sounded neat with pets and charm so I made Nitsche. Nitsche is now level 18, and I must admit, I have had some fun in game. I think the fun has really been exploring, but I am having a hard time deciding actually what was fun. It took some work getting Nitsche to level 18, I have to say. Not a single question I ever asked anyone was ever answered. Either every other player is unresponsive or they just don't give a damn. I didn't expect that...

That was my third mistake.

Well, I thought there would be great content after finding most people were playing with WinAmp or pr0n instead of in game, so I decided on trying some missions.

That definately was a mistake!!

I got some great loot for being my level very early on...the missions were certainly tough and without a pet it was even tougher. I soon found out that the mission system was screwed up. I got missions were I was to find a guy only, and he attacked me on sight. Not a problem, but my pet would kill him so fast I wouldn't get any experience from the kill and no resolution to the quest! I sucked it up... I tried different missions too like the one where you just have to pick up an item and never got my reward, or the missions that are for newland desert which isn't actually part of the newland city map even though newland desert area is there. I petitioned a GM, and although he seemed nice, wouldn't do anything for the item mission and the desert mission was given up for after a 3 hour wait in queue. So much for missions...

I decided to just see what there was to do besides missions and arena PvP...certainly there has to be more exploring to be done! I hit the nearest zone...nobody has a decent map anyways, so I figured I would poke my head through and see what was afoot...

A Bullthingie has hit you for 135 dmg.
A Bullthingie has hit you for 127 dmg.
Loading please wait...

WTF?
 The zone hadn't even finished loading yet?

So much for exploring....

Well, other bugs that are still in game:

Pack inventory deleting when the backpack is full
Pack inventory moving
Pet pathing
Pet standing in front of monster but never attacking
Pet popping up right beside you the moment the monster dies and/or you die...I got exp one time when I died with no pet help and got exp after exp loss from pet coming up and getting the last blow in...
Nano spells never sticking even on lowest mobs
Nano spells not sticking to pet(not a bad thing for me, but it was odd seeing my rooted pet sliding along with me)
LAG
Instant attack extremely red KOS monsters on other side of outdoor zones
Zones not loading
Lockpicks not working on doors until you try them multiple times, not a failure, but when the message that you cannot use that item type on that...

Well, some of these problems are the exact kind of problems I had six months ago and I see they are not fixed. =/ I loved AO in beta, it has great potential and I invested a lot of time to get these same problems fixed, but I cannot invest any more time into a game just to lose everything I did. It's just not fun...

Thanks for the free month guys, but I think it's sad that I used it only about 5 days before I finally got this frustrated =(

Kytryl @ 12/22/2001 11:15:18 AM (BUG: Ruse of Terran 5093):
Agents NF Ruse of Terran is bugged after 13.5

If zoned with the NF running, the agent will become extrenely small and move extremely slow. Only way to move is to jump around.

This make sneaking missions even more impossible than before.

Kytryl @ 12/22/2001 11:18:24 AM (5063):
Well it's like the good ol days when you cant zone ebfore you complete an implant or its toasted.

This time you have to zone in and out in between steps to make sure they work correctly.

Anyway I wont be spending anymore IP on agility for jewel crafting. pointless at this stage since this is another unfinished project been pushed out.

Kytryl @ 12/22/2001 11:24:19 AM (4871):
I am an engie and I dont spend IP in trade skills unless i need them for trimmers for my bot.

reason been the trade crafting is still very much incomplete. And even if you make a weapon, its damage output are so much worst then one you can commonly find on the market or even the machine shop.

What's the point of spending a few weeks trying to salvage trade items, spend loads of cash and IP, and then hoping you can complete the kit to make a wepaon. And find out you can pay 50% of the price you spent and get a MUCH better weapon in a flash?

For example Fiddle riffle is a joke. Seriously tradeskills are only for people who are bored out of their skull. It does not serve any purpose other than creating frustrations.

Kinkstaah @ 12/22/2001 1:51:46 PM (BUG : FLurry of Blows 5097):

That's a pretty old one. You look as though you're selected, but it's bugged... You need to press escape to deselect yourself and then F1 to reselect yourself and the packs should work okay. Not a great fix, but it does stop your having to go outside.

Hossley @ 12/22/2001 2:10:41 PM (Burst button can be pressed when reloading... 5098):
Please, please, please could someone look at mending the Burst action? 

It used to be fine, then a few patches ago it became bugged so that you can press the Burst icon whilst reloading, the Burst flag is set and when you reload you can't use it until the timer resets. It's incredibly annoying to lose a burst like this and for some strange reason it seems that an awful lot of the time your burst recharges at just the same time that your ammo runs out.

I'm sure this would be easy to fix, so please could someone do it?

Cheers,

Hoss.

Scorus @ 12/22/2001 5:31:46 PM (4882):
An update, this bug is much worse than I thought. It happens to me all the time (never happened before 13.4) and I've found that I can't use, equip or unequip anything until I've zoned.

Yesterday I was in that oasis in the middle of Varmint Woods. I couldn't save, I couldn't unequip my vehicle (meaning I couldn't use nanos), I couldn't complete my mission by giving the item to the mission booth, I couldn't do anything. I finally had to head for the zone border, which was a long way away. My pet was still responding to commands as soon as I gave them, so I don't think this was a lag problem. I have a feeling that it has to do with the new vehicle change that makes them equip and not equip, but that is really just a big old guess.

Chill @ 12/22/2001 8:09:04 PM (Bug with Kalinkalov Mz-99 5113):
Having a MA I spent some ip in assault rifle, aimed shot and burst to use this weapon with my fists because it's supposed to allow to use brawl too (it's a req to equip the weapon) but when I hit my brawl key it misses everytime (I have the brawl text over my head but it never hits).
If it's not a bug I have no idea why this weapon has a brawl req.
I hope you fix it soon because I really wanted to have some fun with aweapon no one uses.

hobbes @ 12/23/2001 12:24:22 AM (token and mission reward lost! 5125):
Finished mission, was awarded token and mission prize, but my inventory was full, so your new window opened up holding these items. Without moving, I opened my backpack to place items there to open inventory slots. The backpack window replaced the token and reward window.

After putting several items in backpack I closed it, the token and reward were gone. Took me 2 hours to complete this mission, very frustrating. I never moved, never left the room. 

Fix this problem and please let me know you have actually read this!

This happened twice. I'm being chased back to the entrance by a mob. One of the doors won't let me through. I can't get out of the mission and die. Just lost alot of credits due to this bug.

A really strange bug popped up the other day. You know those small rooms with three doors with the rolling fire thingy? The doors can't be entered because of a glass or plastic barrier. Well, I was being chased and ran right through one of these barriers. I couldn't get out. Somehow the mob also managed to get in. I still couldn't get out and died.

MasterJet @ 12/23/2001 6:15:22 AM (5098):
I have been having this problem as well.  I have been working my Trader for a while without Burst, but the past day or so of playing my Soldier I have wasted many a Burst due to this bug.  I too seem to need a reload at the same time that I get a Burst.  I've finally gotten a bit more paranoid and have my ammo ready to reload just before I Burst so as not to waste the chance, but I still have missed a few even then.

The most ironic part of this gaming experience is going to be when they fix the bug and don't let us know.  Funcom, is it that you have SO MANY BUGS that you can't document fixing them, or is it that you accidentally fix them just like you accidentally cause them?  Every time you add a feature or fix a bug you seem to create more bugs.

Tick, tock, tick, tock... that's the sound of my 6 month subscription coming to a close soon.  I hope you Funcom folks are looking for new jobs, because when Rubi Ka is an empty wasteland you will need them.

In reading these posts I see things I certainly don't understand.  But if something was working before the patch and the only thing that has changed IS the patch then I'd recommend messages to bugs@anarchy-online.com and to support@anarchy-online.com reporting just what is happening.

I'll bet there are folks from Funcom reading these posts but that is a bit different than their having accurate reports in their email in-box.  I've dealt with "support" enough to know they really do pay attention, even if I don't get an immediate reply.  I'd rather have them working on the code than sending email anyway, much more productive.  <smile>

And while some things may be out of whack there are other things that are being made better, it's SO nice to actually take Icaria into a mission and not only succeed but enjoy it.

WRITE THOSE MESSAGES, IT WILL HELP US ALL.

Phikia @ 12/23/2001 8:55:18 PM (Serious Teaming bug 5182):
Please forgive me if this topic has been posted previously..

Whenever I go hunting with a team, at some point my character invariably stops attacking the enemy. Additionally, each time I hit the Brawl key, I get a response like "Let your attack finish first" even though I don't have an attack in process. 

I 1st tried equiping/un-equiping my Yalmaha to see if that would shake it off, but THEN i wound up unable to get out of the Yalmaha. Regardless, I have to either zone or grid & grid back, then re-join my team to be able to fight again.

BTW- This only happens to me when teaming.

Anyone else experiencing similar problems?

Thanks!

Mustafo @ 12/23/2001 9:46:59 PM (5074):
Not sure about the rest but OOC is zone wide for every zone.  if you turn it off in newland, it will still be on in tir, tir county, and greater tir county.  I found you need to turn it off in every zone you enter and it will remember each individually.

Annoying, but the channel is independent in each and every zone.

Mustafo @ 12/23/2001 10:04:40 PM (MA MOB bug with double attacks 5187):
I noticed last night that the graphics were showing a variety of attacks.  

First it would show the MA MOB attacking twice, this was the normal graphic which one attack would hit 

Then it would show them attack once and this would do damage but the recharge time was considerably faster.

Last it would show 3 attacks 2 of which would hit.  The first was normal the second was not as my reflect shield did not show damage reflection.


I have a bracer for melee damage and in the above it would not show reflected damage on the second or third situations only on the first.

This seems to be a bug.  This may also be happening on other types of MOBs but I could not verify since I only have the melee shield.

In addition I noticed that if I have to run out of a mission and I come back, the mob now has at least a doubled init for whatever weapon they are using.  I realize this may be intentional to prevent players from killing MOBs much higher than them, but with the high agro from other rooms I seem to experience and the fact that I run out of nano before I can kill an Atrox enforcer type that is just yellow, its fast becoming more than a bit annoying.  With Manteze I am better of waiting until they leave the room by the door as twice the speed on them kills me in no time flat.

Chest-found ammunition does not stack with store-bought ammunition.

Not sure why this is. There's no difference in quality level, or description of the item by shift-left click/'t'. Not really major, but it's slightly annoying to have an extra slot taken up. Major drag, especially, for Agents using low-clip rifles. Most other guns can take a 25 clip and ask for more, but it takes three or four reloads for some of the rifles.

Psiraven @ 12/24/2001 3:34:07 AM (Possible IP bug with Nano Resistance skill 5212):
Hello just reporting a possible bug.

Im 145th level and have raised my Nano Resistance skill to the title cap.  The thing is, I noticed that raising my Int and Psychic doesnt raise Nano Resistance at all.  Im locked at 450.   I deliberately did not add to Int and Psy for several levels to see if I simply wasnt adding enough points to those attributes.

Nope, I can add 30 points into Int and Psy and Nano Resistance doesnt budge when I should be getting automatic points.  Im guessing this has been happening since level 1.  If so, people my level have probably lost about 100+ points from their nano resistance score.

Anyone else have this prob?

I noticed this as well.  I'm lvl 87, my AR skill has been capped for about 5 levels.  The last 3 levels I haven't gotten any bonus AR points and I figured I should have because I raised all 3 primary attributes 9 points each (3 for each of those levels).  No joy.

Ouchers sounds like a nasty bug.  Probably is because you are in the title cap area.  When you are lvl 149 record the stats and then see if at lvl 150 when the title cap breaks again see if those phantom points are given to you.  If not then i would recomment not increasing base attributes while in a title caped area

Tetra @ 12/24/2001 7:24:48 PM (deadly bug with pets since last patch. 5247):
I've been having alot of problems lately since the patch where a pet will stop responding, unlike the old healpet bug it seems to be the attackpet instead and no matter what you try to tell the pet to do (/pet petname command) you just get invalid pet command (terminate follow etc).  I've had the misfortune to have mostly cave missions since the patch but the pet has seemingly charged through a wall or something as I'm unable to find it when this happens.  This has happened to both my MP attack pet and my engineer friend who tends to play with me.

p.s. as a side note, i hate having to /terminate my pet or /pet wait and pull mobs across those small rooms with two ledges with a pool of water between them where you need to jump out while still in the water...  would be real nice if it was changed to an incline or something that the pets could handle.

Tetra @ 12/24/2001 7:37:11 PM (Unable to target someone in tree over 2ho grid. 5248):
It's impossible to target someone who drops into the tree over the 2ho grid from a yalm.   It was cool for all of the first shot or two that it took to figure out where the shots were coming from since tab didnt work for it but after finding him it was impossible to click from 1st person or any of the third person views.  Getting rooted and killed when you cant fight back because of this really sucks...

Tetra @ 12/24/2001 7:50:54 PM (MP 3rd pet... pretty lights but nothing happens. 5249):
Either there is a bug or the new MP pet was released nerfed by design a bit too much.   Currently I've yet to find anyone who could actually say "yes it does something other than add itself to the hatelist and spread out mob attacks sometimes if your lucky".  I have the QL80some summoning of absuum and when attempting to send him after one of the newbie mobs outside omni-ent the mob instantly breaks whatever it is that absuum casts and charges me, the same happens on friends in the arena (the icon shows and pretty lights but nothing happens) the shades i was hunting in my 20's and 30's as well as all the mobs i've come across while hunting solo/grouped reguardless of if the mob is being attacked by anything else or not.   The only use that i've managed to find for it yet was to send it after a mob 1-2 seconds before my attack pet and it eats the first attack for the attack pet sometimes if im lucky... If that's the case, to be quite honest it's not worth the nano cost or the mattmet buff on the NCU.

Are they bugged or nerfed by design?   if nerfed by design could the root/mez/WhateverItDoes  be changed to last a useful amount of time >1ms or make whatever it does put the little blue ball higher up on the hatelist so it soaks up some damage doing that little affect.

Ampris @ 12/25/2001 5:28:48 AM (5098):
Using any special attack with an empty ranged weapon and it initiates the attack, but since there are no bullets you waste the special.

So you have to wait for the reloading process to complete and until you do a regular attack before using a special.  Otherwise you might waste your special.

It is also a good habit to manually reload after combat to ensure you don't try to open with a special when your gun is empty.

Obitus @ 12/25/2001 8:32:07 AM (Crashing! 5276):
I seem to be crashing more and more lately.  I was around in late july and early august when everybody was crashing every 5 mins so this is nothing new to me.  I has been so good as of late though that i am really surprised that I am having this issue.

Standard crash:

I start running or zone and another character or mob starts to come into view.  My machine locks up and nothing short of hitting the reset button will have any effect.  I reboot and then restart the game, sometimes I am offered to go back into the same character as it is still logged on, other times I just choose the character as if i did a full shutdown.  When I get back into the game, I notice that my Team window, Friends window and stats window are open. (this is no matter what windows I had open before the crash)  Also, I have run into a wall and am as far from my crashing point as I can go in a straight line.  This is happening indoors and outdoors with real characters and Mobs.  

This is really getting bothersome.  I am having trouble teaming now as I am crashing so often.

I have not changed any settings on my computer so I do not believe that it is the issue.  The one thing that has changed is that I finally changed over to the new video format. 

Could the new video format be giving me the problem?

I am playing UT, Need for Speed, Et Al with no trouble at all.

I dont know if this is only high level based problem but i noticed this with deamons and normal pets. 

When a fight starts pet hits at an normal rate but when targets life goes to 30% or lower the pet starts to miss it seems ALLOT, somthimes target hits 7 times before pet hits ones. Now this is very enoying and can't be intenional cause somthimes, but mostly not, the pet hits at an normal rate till targets death. 


This is tested unbuffed and buffed results are same. 

Somone else noticed this? or know whats causing it? 

My first thought was that the pet changes somhow his own defense-agro setting but i see no reason why it should do that in the end of an fight.

LRRH @ 12/25/2001 9:35:43 AM (Martial Artist skill skips refresh time on failure.. 5280):
Is this intentional or a bug?

If a target resists the skill (I've -just- started one, made it to level 4 or so tonight; so only the beginning skill so far), I can immediately attempt to use it again; and again, and again, until it hits.

Yet once it hits, it still takes a few seconds for it to come back. Is it supposed to do this?

Granted, it doesn't seem to be a big deal. It does so little damage (usually two points, occasionally three) that the balance isn't an issue. I'm just sort of curious. If you can keep pressing the button until it hits, why bother making it resistable in the first place?

Can't target through vine-doors in cave interiors; can't left-click (or even get the crosshairs to come up) an enemy, nor can you TAB 'em. This has been around forever, but since it's still here, I thought I'd mention it again. Intentional? Bug? I can see the intentional angle (no pun intended); thick vegetation, cannot aquire a steady lock. Wanted to ask anyway.

I have never had an enemy's special attack - Burst, Full Auto, Fling Shot - work on any of my characters; that is, Enemy does Burst at me, no damage message. And yet, I have -never- had one of these special attacks miss when -I- use them. (not the Burst or Full Auto, at least). Are we sure they're working properly?

1) I have been seeing this recently. I also found that waiting 30 secs does allow you to access the corpse. 

2) This is a BIG peeve I have with this game currently. When I fight with my MA, I hit it with BOP then brawl. After the message that I can brawl again comes up, it says I must wait. Why must I wait? The timer has already expired. I must now not only wait for the MA skill timer to complete, but I must wait about 10 more secs. I have very little lag and very good pings. I always get this in mission, or outside. I have found that after I use these two attacks, if I wait till after both messages, then wait 10 secs, I can perform both actions again. If this is the case, don't issue that message until I can actually use the attack again. Please.

3) The problem I have related to this is, I can be shot at through walls in missions.

I chose the +10% taller option in character creation. 

Comparing my size to other people and asking them what size they chose I dedcued that I have been made 10% smaller by the bsuit

LRRH @ 12/27/2001 12:08:04 AM (Maps as loot need to be adjusted/removed 5383):
As it stands, the -only- maps I ever find are Mort or Newland. Doesn't matter whether I'm playing Omni, Neutral, or Clan, these are the only two I ever find.

Personally, I think they should just be removed as something you can find in chests, off enemies, or as mission rewards. They're one of the cheapest items in the game, you can find Map Terminals in any Basic Quality Supermarket. There's no real reason to have them as something to find.

LRRH @ 12/27/2001 12:14:39 AM (Omni mission destinations are unreasonable. 5385):
Starting around level 6 or 7, my little Omni martial artists started getting missions that wanted him to go to places like Stret West Bank, or Borealis, or occasionally Newland.

There is -no way- to get from any of the Omni territories to those neutral locations at that low of a level. The only overland route is to take the Whom-pa to Broken Hills, cross the no-man's land to the Clan outpost, take their Whom-pa to Athen, and then to Newland.

The only other - perhaps -the- only, period - viable way is to take the Grid. There are a couple problems with this:

1) I have not seen any information on the Grid anywhere in the manual, in Bookstore Terminals, or anything. There does not appear to be any information at all about it; it's just something people are expected to know, or to visit unofficial/fan sites to find out. This is a serious problem.

2) The absolute minimum Computer Literacy skill needed to use a Grid terminal is, I believe, 75, and that's not universal (some terminals require more, it seems; sometimes much more). The only way to get that kind of skill level as a new character is by some major twinking which, according to Gaute's little article, is verboten (or will be).

So.. how about taking another look at this? I was tempted to put this under Game Mechanics, but I think these are serious enough to warrant bug status. There's no reason for there to be so little information about the Grid, and Omni mission terminals sending you out to neutral country can't be good either.

NF attacks are supposed to be NOT dependant on armor for resists or subject to AC point reduction yet there is a lasersniper mob on which this one NF continuously hits for 505 dmg EVERY time.

Just curious if there are any plans to fix this or if the combat system is completely FUBAR now because of all the radical PvM and PvP changes that have been made.

Tetra @ 12/27/2001 4:43:32 AM (5385):
heh at 72 im getting lots of missions in places like central artery vally and such, you really just have to live with it and when you arent sure where a mission is and you click upload to map and see it's in nomans land just delete mission and find another.

Bierbauch @ 12/27/2001 10:30:35 AM (5383):
Both maps were bugged / non-existent. After fixing them they appeared as loot in chests and mobs.

Mustafo @ 12/27/2001 5:24:03 PM (5383):
I really only need 1 map of Mort or Newland, but I get offered them as rewards quite a bit.  Make it so all maps show up as loot and this would be better.  Single use items without any different QLs make bad rewards if they show up alot.

Kragz @ 12/27/2001 5:27:26 PM (Missions (Bait & Switch) 5435):
This has happened to me twice recently.

After mission camping for a few thousand credits :P  I finally get a mission description that offers the reward of a NCU belt that can hold 4 upgrades.  However, the final reward is always a belt of the same QL, and name as the mission reward description, however only capable of holding 3 NCU upgrades.

Last Night I double checked the reward description just to be sure, before cramming the quest item into the radar display.  This is a very annoying bug.

D.Shaffer @ 12/27/2001 7:11:22 PM (5435):
Check the item itself, just dont look at the name.  'Low' QL versions of a belt do not have the full potential of the item.  So while the name of the item might be '4 Slot NCU belt' (Or whatever), it might actually hold only 3.  Used to be the same with NCUs until they changed the name.

Where are you hitting the mission terminal at?  Since the change in the mission settings, usually about 1/3 of the missions are in the same area or one zone aways.  If you're close to those zones when you grab the missions, then you're going to get a lot of missions to those areas.  Try hitting a mission terminal in Rome-Blue and keep hitting until you get one you feel is safe to go to.

Dumbasbricks @ 12/27/2001 7:26:52 PM (5435):
Belts NCU capabilities and lower ql of a belt type changing into a belt class one notch down is a current bug. I spoke to a GM about it and he stated that the belt should be kept until Funcom is done addressing the issue.

He "did not" state however if the belts are going to be switched to match their descriptions and merely implied it. I missioned for 2 6 slot belts and received 5 slot belts instead.

I hope this helps. At least you could still obtain your belts in terminals in a crunch =)

Take care and safe journeys

LRRH @ 12/27/2001 8:19:30 PM (5385):
I was using the terminals in Rome-Blue, actually. ;)

There's always at least one or two missions that are for nearby; it's just that most of them want to send me way, way the heck out, and it didn't make any sense; this is on the basic 50% difficulty rating, too.

LRRH @ 12/27/2001 8:21:45 PM ("Weight of Guilt" is adding runspeed 5447):
..instead of subtracting it. Saw a character go from 60 to 499 Running, and it wasn't a display bug in the Skills menu; there was a definite difference in speed with the program running, and dropping back to normal when it expired.

Check the description of the item it will show what it actually is,  this has been a bug since the beginning.  Belts happen to be one of the few items that show what they are in the name.  You will see alot of armor listed as superior, but when you get it it's worn not superior, but you knew the QL before you took the mission.  Belts and NCU's have different graphics for the different belts and make the bug more noticeable.

Sohjiro @ 12/27/2001 9:57:47 PM (Zoning in a Yalmaha 5459):
These might be old bugs, but it doesn't hurt to remind FunCom.

Zoning over water in a yalmaha or any type of morphed form makes the character move extremely slow upon zoning. I was flying into Upper Stret East in my yalmaha with my team following me in their Yalmahas. Upon zoning we were all in the water with our yalmahas going extremely slow. Luckily there were no enhanced sharks in the vicinity so we made it land quickly. Unequiping the yalmahas and reequiping them in the water didn't help.

The second time we did this I decided to morph everyone into reets (for the +200 swimming ability) hoping that the zone wouldn't cause another bug. Zoned and yup, Reets with our feet in the water travelling extremely slow. This time the sharks got us.

Also, sometimes for no apparent reason I'll zone and take fall damage depending on how high up I was before zoning.

I understand that a coordinate system for players is needed (X,Y,Z) to estabilsh location. It always seems that the X, and Y coordinates are correct with the new X, and Y coords on zoning, but not the Z. In other words if I zone west on the north part of the Greater Tir zone in my yalmaha at an altitude of 100m, I appear on the NE part of Varmint Woods on the ground. 

So my question is, why is the altitude set to 0 upon zoning when your are flying? And why can't you fly over the walls of a city and zone that way? Sometimes I'd like to avoid all the lag at a city's gate and just zone over the wall (at the correct altitude).

Also, altitude is set to 0 if you crash while in a yalmaha. A complete crash, not a crash to desktop. I was taking a friend on a tour of Deep Artery valley when all of the sudden he crashes in mid flight. When logged back on he was in the water below in his yalmaha and couldn't fly. He was travelling very slowly like the Zone bug I described above. Well Lo and Behold a Quake Lizard relieved him of his frustration as soon as he got near land.

We haven't been back to DAV since.

Drop rate is just fine. You just need to know where. I have about 20 of those rocks already.

Tetra @ 12/28/2001 9:35:06 AM (976):

Do I really need to say anything here? This still exists and is happening to me with an increased frequency. Really nifty when the specials I rely on do this since I have absolutely nothing else to fall back on as a soldier, except the zone exit.

Paffy @ 12/28/2001 1:10:11 PM (976):
And your point being?

Yes, I have about 20 of those rocks. Gained from regular hunting. Could have more if I really wanted. No need though. My point was that you can get them if you know where to hunt (certain mobs drop them more often than others). What was your point?

Zarch and bunch of other chars between 3 and 120

Tetra @ 12/28/2001 2:03:18 PM (976):
the tools for making a datadisk into a finished uploadable crystal cost slightly less than 1M credits, In order to recover that cost along with the investment in the numerous skills required for doing (at work right now so cant look at the book to look them up) so you would need to make a good number of finished crystals to recover the investment in credits and more importantly IP.

But hey, like you said they arent that hard to get... lets see
10 carbonrich rocks ql20-30ish
10 carbonrich rocks ql 50-65ish
10 carbonrich rocks ql 100-120ish
and 10 carbonrich rocks ql 150-200ish

hey lets put a reasonable timeframe on this collection too, say a week.

Kragz @ 12/28/2001 6:35:37 PM (5435):
Maybe i should clarify:

Item description in mission reward - holds 4 NCU upgrades

Actual Mission reward Item - holds 3 NCU upgrades

I was very careful to check what the mission item reward was, versus the actual item that I received.  The belt itself stayed the same name and QL as described in shift clicking on the item in the mission screen vs shift clicking on the reward given.  

If i shift click on the item in the mission icon and it says the belt holds 4 NCU upgrades, then I should expect the belt itself rewarded to hold 4 NCU upgrades, it really is not that hard, and is an easily reproducable bug if you want to verify it yourself 

Oh well, bought a belt and NCU's now just need to starve a few levels of IP's into bringing computer lit up to 171 so i can buff myself into it

Spookymonster @ 12/28/2001 6:51:17 PM (976):
Anyone care to provide a little more info on where these are found?

Anyone can claim they have a hunting spot where rocks fall like rain. However, without any empirical data to back it up, it's all just smoke and mirrors.

I'm not flaming; I'm just trying to get back on topic. We know rocks spawn; saying you have a scads of them littering your apartment doesn't really add to the discussion. Telling us where, when, and how is far more constructive.

--Xente

Skara @ 12/28/2001 8:18:07 PM (5383):
I agree with adjusting them. The code should randomize the loot, where I have a chance of getting ANY item in the game database (some items would appear more often, but I should still be able to find a decent weapon, good armor, nanos I can use, specials like melee rings and decus coats, or a new belt), but close to my lvl. 

If the item that comes up is an item type with multiple possiblities, that should also be randomized around my lvl. 

I have found a map of Mort (several actually) with a relatively low lvl character. My main has died in Mort. The low lvl character I found the Mort map with should not have been able to find THAT map. 

Another map that I would have had the complit at that lvl to be able to use, and of course been high enough lvl to be able to survive going there, would be ok, even if I already had the map.

I would just like to see more randomized items. There is either a serious bug in the code handling randomization, I notice decent items come in spurts like 2 melee rings in the same mission and 2 decus coats in the same mission camp session, and/or only a small subset of possible items from the game database exist in the database the rewards and loot are drawn from. 

I have noticed the same implants showing up over and over along with the map of Mort.

Funcom, please randomize the items, and expand the database of loot items to include all possible items, just attach a weight to each item so harder to find loot doesn't appear as often.

Skara @ 12/28/2001 8:40:09 PM (4681):
I started a new character last night (Agent). Ran the self buff to increase my dmg. Allocated IP, including to rifle and its associated base stats. 

My attack rating never increased until I died. After I fully recoved from res shock, my attack rating had increased. Same thing happened after I levelled. Put IP in all the right places, but my attack rating didn't increase until after res effects wore off after my next death (I got greedy at lvl 2 and went for an orange Biofreak. Bad move).

Is it safe to assume my skills are being calculated correctly on the server Cosmik, and that it is just visual? I will experiment some more this weekend with that character and see if I notice a difference.

Archu @ 12/28/2001 8:58:52 PM (Something is wrong with the hate system 5544):
I was hunting borgs at the factory in Avalon. we were many and soon all the defenses were breached and we got inside. There we camped for borgs. First it went well. The borgs kept targetting people randomly. After I got my first level, the borgs started to target me more and more. Soon about 80% of all borgs who spawned would target me first and then switch to somebody attacking them. I could handle it quite fine until when I was only lacking 4k exp for my next level I got shot a couple times by a sarge. Needles to say I died. Grr. I come back and the targetting is getting worse and worse. The borgs target me more and more. Soon I get another level up. After that point about 98% of the borgs always targetted me first (I think that during the whole level, I was targetted by all but one or two borgs). Luckily I was able to achieve one more level. The next borg after my level up killed me so I was kinda lucky in the end. I still wonder what made me such a delicious target. It has to be a bug. 

Oh and I was a MP. I didn't even attack the borgs myself, just my pets and I nuked only once.

Archu @ 12/28/2001 9:07:43 PM (4681):
The playful cub transformation is buggy too. You can  see the normal head (or helmet) between the two dog heads. I think it's suposed to be cerberus

It actually goes farther than that, I think...it checks resistance before checking skill lock, period.  I've sometimes jumped the gun (where I should've got "can do in 6 seconds") and gotten a 'resist'...and, like your note, it ignored that I tried and unlocked 6 seconds later...

Personally, I've always wondered why nano resist works against a physical attack...

LRRH @ 12/28/2001 10:09:44 PM (5280):
It might be some sort of default; it uses nano points, so it counts as a nano attack doing melee damage. If that's the case, some sort of tweak would be nice. As I see it, the nanobots are augmenting the MA's physical body for a -very- brief period of time (something less than a second, probably) and then spending some time recharging, allowing the body to cope with the sudden stress.

Psiraven @ 12/28/2001 10:39:28 PM (5212):
I confirmed this bug.  I reached 150th level last night as a Meta-Physicist (Psiraven).   I haven't been raising Int and Psy since level 133.  Upon hitting the next title I raised them both by FIFTY points and my Nano Resistance didnt budge.  Its still 450.  

Im guessing that had the IP system been working correctly Id have a nano resistance around 580 or so.  

Needless to say, I hate the idea that a character I spent so much time with is so badly marred.  I guess Ill be needing that IP reset after all.   I hope this problem is fixed by then.

Thyrra @ 12/28/2001 10:46:44 PM (5212):
i noticed it with my noob doc.  was rasing skills and noticed that the other evades consistently increased a little bit yet nano resist did not.  i have to spend ip directly to get it to increase.  it felt like i was getting a little rip at the ip loss.  

oh well, another bug.

Psiraven @ 12/29/2001 4:34:55 AM (5212):
I think its just a display bug on the client.

I petitioned today and got a response from the GM, Jdaug.

I asked him what he saw as my Nano Resistance skill.  He told me I had a 550-ish Nano Resistance.

That surprised me.  Then he said 450 was my base skill (which it is).

So while he watched, I spent the IP to  raise Psychic by 32 points.  Then, he said my Nano Resistance had gone up by 5 pts.

On my computer the whole time I only saw 450, before and after the increase in Psychic.

So it seems to be just a display bug on the client.  (whew) =)

BTW, seriously, fix the flurry of fists, it randomly decreases melee init, decreases run speed, swim speed, Evade and ducking until you zone out.

LRRH @ 12/30/2001 8:45:11 AM (Bugged backpack collection from chest in mission. 5636):
This surprised the heck out of me.

Finishing out a few rooms in a mission, I came across a chest. Being the curious (and thieving) character I am, and anyway they were all dirty clan bastards, I opened the chest to find: a small backpack, a medium backpack, a large backpack, and a book of knowledge.

Score!

I try and open one of the backpacks, by right-clicking on it. It.. does nothing. Tried the others, and the book. Still nothing. Upped my heretofore ignored Adventuring skill to 21, to be able to wear the small backpack. Tried right-clicking, tried wearing, then removing, then clicking again.. nothing.

So I zoned out of the mission, and tried all of those things again. -Still- no dice. None of them will open. Zoned out from where I was (Omni-Pol Barracks/Screening Area) into Entertainment, again tried.. nothing. 

Made my way over to Trade, to sell off other things I'd picked up; lo and behold, someone on the OOC channel reported the -same problem-: they'd found a set of the three backpacks, and none of them will work.

Anyone else run into this? Is there a fix? Are they broken beyond repair? I'm not losing sleep over this, as I'm not the packrat (rollerrat? ;) some people are, with their banks full of backpacks and items; I don't need these in any way. But I am curious as to why they don't work.

Hi,

I know there was a bug with AE's attacking everyone in a team until recent when you fixed it, but it seem's you missed out pets on that. I was in a team yesturday which was all Omni except for myself being Neut. We were in 20k killing NPC's like so many do and I was AE nuking groups of NPC's where where congregating on our nice friendly Atrox shaped meatsheild 
All was fine till we somehow managed to loose our MP (died after catching an aggro). I continued to AE the NPC's but was also then hitting the dead MP's pets. Which then also aggroed on me, and it seems a couple of other members of the team (not massively sure about the latter but I definatly got hit by them).
Anyhow, just a warning, dont AE if you loose an MP in your team.

I have experienced this same bug repeatedly.  So far the only zone I've had it happen in is Pleasant Meadows.  I am a soldier, so I pull most of the time when teamed.  I like playing in 3rd person more because I see more of what's around me, but, because of this bug I have to play in 1st person so I don't get this 'zoom out bug' when I'm making a pull.

Its easy to recreate this bug.  Stay in 3rd person view, then use the 4 and 6 keys on the keypad to pan to the right and left of the camera view.  Eventually your view will zoom out miles away from your location.

Its a highly annoying bug and I'm hoping a fix is being worked on right now.  I hate using 1st person view.

*** The slash-button ("/") suddenly stops working (both of them - the one in the numberpad, and the other one (shift + 7)). ***

My inventory is messed after soning from almost every store I leave.

*** The new tradeskill rooms in the stores are driving me crazy. Everytime someone in the store enters the trade room or exits it, my pc freezes for a little more than a second. This is VERY IRRITATING, as it really messes me up and happens like a zillion times when I visit a store. I might be in the middle of a trade, wanting to press accept after searching out 10 clusters for my implants  and because of the 'freeze' that occours everytime someone enters trade room, I accidentally press the refuse button... ARGH!   
(I can be in the nano dept. for that case, doest matter. Entering or exiting the trade room affects the entire store)
This freeze also makes it very difficult to enter the tradeskill room, because after I 'defreeze', I find myself many metres away from the actual door I was aiming at... 
PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP! This bug is universal and is directly linked to every store with the new tradeskill room ***

Sometimes when I deadlink in mid-air in my Yalm, I find myself like way up in the outter layers of the atmosphere when I relog. The only way to get down to earth again, is to press backspace. It takes like over 1 minute to fall all the way down 
The fall of course kills me. This has happened to me twice.
After both instances I read something like:

"You took 1400 points of fall damage"
"You took 1400 points of fall damage"
"You took 1400 points of fall damage"
"You took 1400 points of fall damage"

I had around 1400 hp's at the time...  

BTW - the advice about placing the yalm in the bank, zone to store, zone back, pick up yalm, equip - worked for me. At least untill I DL in mid-air. Then I get stuck in my yalm again. 

My pet-pathing is a chapter of its own... Very annoying!

Archu @ 12/31/2001 2:14:48 PM (5641):
So that's why I get the messages about my pet being attacked by my team mates every time I die.

Archu @ 12/31/2001 2:25:34 PM (2279):
Maybe you are being hit by meta-shield wielding enemies? They hit chemical dmg you know. 

I too have noticed this AC bug. On melee enemies my pet hits about 150-200. On ranged enemies it's closer to 200-350.

Luckily MP pet have high min dmg

Arterous @ 12/31/2001 2:49:27 PM (Plane cannot be unequiped 5711):
Last night I had a system crash, Blue screen of death , As I came back into the game I was still in my Plane.  I tried to unequip and I was unable to.  I was about 20 feet in the air and was able to move laterally but as soon as I tried to ascend or Descend it would automatically center view.  So I /quit, relogged, let the server think I was completely off.

I log back in and im not in my plane.  I think ok Im good,  but my plane is red in my inventory.  But Im not in my plane.  I tried to equip it and I am able.  But as soon as I get in I cant get out unless I relog or go Indoors.  I petitioned several times last night and well...  didn't get a response.

Anyone out there had/have this problem?  Any Solutions?

Maddogg @ 12/31/2001 3:06:29 PM (2279):
thx Scorus i will try that and yes my evade and dodge is really low thx a lot

ragingsyph1 @ 12/31/2001 4:11:58 PM (5711):
i too have had that problem Arterous, and have decided to shelf AO for a while. after spending god knows how many hours saving up 4.9 mill to get a plane, i go on vacation for a week, come back, and my plane doesnt work. to me that is the final straw.someone email me when AO actually(FINALLY) works as its sposed to(actually, Star Wars Galaxies will probably have been out for a year by the time FC fixes theyre product and noone will be playing AO anyway) in the mean time i will continue to thoroughly enjoy Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Civilization III, both have the amazing distinction of ACTUALLY WORKING LIKE THEYRE SUPPOSED TO instead of asking that i pay to be a beta tester for 5 months.

MaDezzie @ 12/31/2001 4:24:37 PM (5711):
There is an incredibly easy fix to this problem.  Same thing happened to me, I crashed while in my yalm, logged back in and couldn't descend at all.

Hit the backspace key.  You'll fall, you'll get damage, but even when falling from the greatest height I've possibly been, I never died from fall damage.  

After you hit backspace and fall, hit backspace again.  Now you're moving at your normal run speed.  Find the nearest zone and go through it.  Voila!  No more stuck in plane.

Your plane will still be red in your inventory, here's how you fix that (btw, FC actually posted the little 'fix' for this too, you should see it everytime you log into AO)

Take your plane out of your inventory and place it in the bank.  Then put it back in your inventory.  Zone into the nearest indoor playfield.

All fixed.  Yes if you're not near a zone when something like this happens, it will get highly annoying.  But, at least there is some way around it.

				Workaround for those stuck in Yalmaha's.

Until we get a fix out for this you should transfer your Yalmaha to the bank then zone to an in-door playfield, a shop or similar. You should then head back to the bank to pick up your Yalmaha again. If this does not solve your problem please send in a petition, using the /petition command in the chatwindow. We are sorry for any inconvenience this problem might have caused you.
			
		
	
This has been up for weeks.  Zone into a shop to unequip it.  Take it out or do what I do and swap a Yamatatchi Movement Predictor into the slot and use that to get the plane out.  Leave it red. And then go stick it in a bank and zone out of the zone and then go back and get your plane.  I personally WILL NOT do a mission with the plane equipped.  Funcom needs to fix this bug so that even when the planed is "red"ed out that we can unequip it and it will go back to "normal" in our inventory.  (I would also like to propose that we be allowed to equip the plane indoors and have it go back to red status so that once we zone outside it will be available immediately again.)

(To Ragingsyph : I sympathize.  I cancelled my account subscription after the 12.6 patch and have yet to reactivate it.  All of the bugs and balance issues this game has really leaves me no other alternative.  I only hope in the month that my account has left on it that they right all the wrongs but I can't in good foresight see them doing this...  cheaters prospered and because of them my oroginal character got nerfed.  Since then the attempts to make the game balanced have been for wrought as the already beyond twinked cheaters are above and beyond everyone who played fair, and the balance attempts only hinder the regular player and make the game less and less fun to play.  I feel sad that this month will be my last, but what can I do?  Funcom apparently still hasn't lived up to their promise...)

Zaal @ 12/31/2001 4:44:08 PM (5655):
It's prolly not as easy a bug to fix as u think.  (I do models, 3d stuff, and animation for a living)  

The green is actually supposed to be transparent (if its a solid color) and is supposed to "map over" a skin texture that lays the groundwork for your character's skin.  It would probably be extremely helpful if you could screenshot it and reports your race and body type in a bug report with the information about the armor included.

Arterous @ 12/31/2001 5:32:44 PM (5711):
Please excuse me Zaal, I just got back from 2 weeks of vacation.  I didn't mean to burden you with my post.

Dezzie, Thanks a lot.  I guess I don't pay much attention to the front page as by the time I get home I just want to hop on and play.  I appreciate your help.

Regards,

 my girlfriend and iwere just discussing it, and have decided to cancel our accounts as well and try out DAoC. it has nothing but wonderful reviews from not only review sites, but the players as well. though the graphics are nowhere near as nice as AO, a game (this point proven time and time again by AO) is not just about pretty graphics. after sitting through patch after patch "fix" after "fix" and innumerous modifications to gameplay and the way characters function, we just can't justify paying FC another $24 in monthly fees for something that has never functioned as advertised. kind of saddens me due to the amount time i have spent on this game and the INCREDIBLE potential of it, but maybe if we(and more people) cancel our accounts, they will take notice and make concerted efforts to make the game function properly, as well as come up with the very necessary class balance that has been lacking since day one.

i relalize this 

back the first week of release ALL armor types that were
supposed to show 'skin' underneath .. short sleeved nail armor

effect .. this was fixed quickly, but for some reason this one piece 
(the female flowers tech) was missed or something ..

Altaire @ 12/31/2001 10:34:20 PM (5641):
Yes, the pet becomes owner-less and behaves like a self guided NPC when he/she/it has no master. 

That's really nothing new. I don't think that is a bug. I have an NT and know when to stop AOE nuking when a MP or other pet owner dies.

Nyadach @ 1/1/2002 9:00:25 AM (5641):
Well its a pretty new "bug" anyhow. As originally (pre patch 13 when AE's effected everyone in the team) they never effected them. So it's either a bug or a new desired feature for NT's to not get along with pets. If it is a new feature of AE's that it would have been nice to have been told about it.

Taldrin @ 1/2/2002 1:33:09 AM (Mobs in missions... 5801):
I haven't blitzed any missions for a while but when I started doing it again today, damn it's insane now.

Once I'm attacked by a mob it will always be right behind me. I can jump over water, take many sharp turns, go from room to room at full speed...

The train of mobs will always be right behind me. 

Mobs no longer seem to need their legs, for they teleport everywhere they want to go instantly. They do not swim across water when chasing you, they teleport across it. They will even teleport through several walls to keep up with you.

Now I'm not slow, with my fixer friend who regularly buffs me up for mission blitzing I have around 1k runspeed. This makes no difference at all now.

I sustain heavy damage and a constant string of hits as I run through the mission.

It's so unrealistic having mobs doing this, so either change this, or let my pet do the same thing!

Plus can we players have the ability to fire whilst moving? Or was that just an extra skill given to mobs...?

Serena @ 1/2/2002 3:05:15 AM (5801):
oh you forgot how 10 mobs agro through the walls when the first 3 in the main room attack you.

Tarrak @ 1/2/2002 4:45:34 AM (5801):
All game developers agree that this is the most difficult part of game design, and it seems it must be the case judging by how badly they all seem to be at it. They go at it like lobbing mortar shells, deliberatly overshooting and undershooting and hoping the right answer will show itself somewhere in between. I'm not aware of this strategy having actually ever worked. The point is, having every MOB in a mission see you thru any number of walls, and teleport right to your location for 5 to 1 gang bang is not a desirable expenditure of one's leisure time. FIX IT BACK THE WAY IT WAS YESTERDAY ,ferkrisakes.

LRRH @ 1/2/2002 5:08:56 AM (5801):
I have -no- idea where in the hell you people are playing, but I never, ever, have any problems with mobs attacking me through walls.

What I -have- noticed is that if I'm fighting a mob near a door - which causes it then to be open and stay open - and another mob comes by, it will join in. This can escelate infinitely; if someone else sees you fighting, they'll join in. 

So.. unless you guys are having bad luck, or poor strategies, I can't see how this is happening to you. And I find it far more realistic to see mobs chase after you - and call their friends on in the chase - than to see you "lose" them, sit, heal, run back and pummel them some more.

Aleta @ 1/2/2002 5:23:33 AM (5801):
LRRH, I'm thinking perhaps it has to do with the level of character that you have.  I have none of these problems either, when I play a lower level character.  But I played my level 80 MA all day today with Tarrak, and what he says is true.  These problems just started with us only today, so I am clueless as to the reason, unless there are problems after certain levels.  Mission after mission, we would enter the first room, see no more than 3 mobs, start fighting, and end up with 6 or more out of nowhere! Can't tell  you how many times I ended up at the reclaim center today, and that is something that usually doesn't happen to me very often!

MadSheep @ 1/2/2002 7:15:45 AM (5801):
This truly must have something to do with your level.
I'm level25 and, as far as i know, I can I can still attrack Mob's from the main room without having everybody on me.

This is a chance  because otherwise, I will never be able to do a mission.

BoooYa @ 1/2/2002 7:26:21 AM (Try to figure this out. I can't advance without it being fixed 5822):
Please someone who can help, look at the link below complete with screen shots of what is happening to my IP and skill points.

I gain IP when I spend it on some skills, and on others it spends normal. Some skills when raised do not save when i hit accept, and some do. How much IP do I have? Where's the IP gone from the skills I've raised, and it hasn't saved when accepted?

I can not raise any skills till this is fixxed due to the fact that if I raise a skill it may just waste my hard earned IP. 

Please Please help me?!?! I've petitioned 3 times, and 3 ARK's do not know. They have escalated the problem, however I have not heard from a GM as of yet.

thank you

LRRH this has always been a problem just at varying degrees its currently at one of its worst. the best it ever was was in beta when every mob stood in its room and waited for you to come in heh those were the days..

I tried DAoC as well.  Very stable game but I found the character classes unable to solo very well (me personal play style, most people are only interested in powerleveling it seems) and I have yet to actually subscribe to DAoC.  If AO doesn't get fixed and at this point fixed fast, then I WILL let my sub run out here and maybe actually pay to play DAoC for a month.  (I still update it even tho I don't log in to play)  Over all, DAoC is ok but i found it lame and lacking compared to AO.  But it works thousands of times better than AO.  So I'm torn.  Good luck to the both of you in your decision.

KillBilly @ 1/2/2002 8:37:42 AM (Neleb the Deranged 5828):
this guy took 1 hr to kill with a 65 adv, 75 ma, and 64 mp, he seemed to have 200k hp and a damage sheild that would only let about 1-3 damage through where a normal burst will do around 300, also he was able to recast the sheild instantly after it terminated for a whole hour. this was in the static dungeon in the omni forest. anyone else run into this?

MaDezzie @ 1/2/2002 9:04:30 AM (5822):
Its happened to me too, but not as drastically as I've heard its done to other people.

I think its attributed to the fact that all your skills rely on those 6 base abilities (stam/str/agil/intel/sense/psy).

It used to be if you tried rasing a skill and your ability was too low you'd be unable to raise the skill further.  Somewhere along the line, I think that got bugged.  I've lost up to as much as 5 points in a skill before.  Sometimes I gain the spent IP back, sometimes I don't.  So I'll think ok, maybe I need to raise one of my abilities, before raising the skill.

This happened to me yesterday.  I raised Matter creation to 305.  I'm a soldier so my intel is really low (150).  Well today, I tried casting MK 4 and I couldn't for I'd lost a point in Matter Creation.  I did not gain back the lost IP for this one point.  I haven't lvl'd since so I can't raise intel, and I really don't want to try raising anymore nano skills without raising intel again, because I don't want to chance losing anymore IP.

Its very upsetting if it happens and more then a few skill points are lost.  I believe I read somewhere that a couple people ended up losing an entire lvl's worth of IP.  The fact that it hasn't been looked into by Funcom is just ridiculous.

Lyriam @ 1/2/2002 9:44:38 AM (errrr...missions? 5831):
wtf has happened to missions?

Yesterday was the most funny (if i can say) missionning day ever.

Grouped with a lvl 40 friend, we take a 75% assassination missions in NL area. After runing for half an our, we finally get to the mission area. Enter, first room : our target, yellow to me (i was lvl 37) we kill him in 40 secs, ç_àxp for me..basta, there were only 4 rooms in the whole mission, not a chest, not a single other mob?! Woohoo talk about loss of time!

Back solo, i take a 60% ish mission (reward = QL 40 for my 37 guy) First room : 3 dep orange soldier robots, impossible to pull one, after any hit, even if i pulled one in the starting room, they all jump on me. I finally kill them all, first little room, a red guy, second room, deep orange, third, deep orange...
I get my ass out of there and go get another mission

EXACT SAME parameters (QL 40 reward, also in TIR - didnt want to run on the other side of the map for experimentations) : all greens, deep green, cant be greener, giving me barely 540 xp each. Not a single yellow guy besides my target, green green green

Who played with the missions coding during christmas eve?

BoooYa @ 1/2/2002 11:54:52 AM (5822):
Well I tried a few more things tonight to fix this problem.

This time I went all out and did the last thing I could think would possibly fix this problem from a user stand point.

I made a new install of AO. Not only a new install but on a different computer, on the other side of town, using a different internet connect, and totaly different hardware etc.. etc..

Nope, not my fault. It still does the same of garbage. Spend IP, Loose IP, Spend IP, Gain IP, Accept changes, Skills don't save, IP gone.

what's a fella supposed to do here funcom?

MORB @ 1/2/2002 2:27:43 PM (5631):
I had this once... Mission in swb in wrecked ship. Two chests, the object to pick up, and nothing else.

I also had sometimes missions with very few rooms, a rollerrat and the object...

MORB @ 1/2/2002 2:39:55 PM (4 holes 5856):
I wonder if it is me, but 4 holes is completly screwed up.

I often have missions at the village after argentum when following the north road, and most of the mine entrances and stuff are hidden by some giant polygons textured with rocks. I can go through it, and it's not visible from the other side - and only after going through I'm able to see mine entrances and stuff.

When zooming out, I did notice that those polygons seems to surround large pieces of rock. It looks like some artifacts left behind during modelisation of the scenery, or something like that... Anyway it looks very ugly.

I don't think the problem comes from me, since I have a friend who see the same stuff...

I don't have the screenshots at hand, I'll post them if necessary.

Also, there's still some misaligned zone limits: when you zone on the road from andromeda to 4 holes, you're shifted approx 50 meters to the west.

Zoning from clon**** to galway is misaligned too...

MORB @ 1/2/2002 2:46:56 PM (5673):
I have this bug from times to times... Usually I can zoom in back again, but I have it often in missions, at random times.

I use the default 3rd person camera, which isn't fixed at a position regarding to your character.

Sometimes, it's following right behind me, I go through a door, and then it zooms all the way back. I zoom in again, move forward, and it zooms back again.

Yesterday, I had a more annoying variation where it zoomed so far away that it gone out of the room and some parts of the screen weren't covered by geometry anymore (displaying the same junk as the bugger doors), and I couldn't zoom back in because it collided with some scenery object that was in the way. I had to go into 1st person and move several rooms from there to be able to use 3rd person view properly again.

MORB @ 1/2/2002 2:50:47 PM (5290):
I agree with all of this...

The first brown cave mission I had was in a building in omni entertainment...

I can't target anything through opened door most of the time, although for some reason it works sometimes....

And I never had any damage from special attacks like burst either. Nor brawling, dimach or anything else...

Caol @ 1/2/2002 3:45:54 PM (5822):
Heya yeah, I just sent this mail to funcom 4 days ago. NO answer yet, and when I petition about it, they just delete the petition, or tell me to send mail to bugs@anarchy-online.com .. (this is going on 5th day without a reply)..

--
This is the 2nd time I can't use a nanoskill, cuz my nano skill-points drop. My body.dev used to be 201, now it's 199. It's small numbers, but it's irritating enough when I cannot use nanos, I've used for a long time.
Please, fix this. I have no other place to go with this, since petitioning don't give me nothing.

New colors for backpacks is currently in the works.  Its in another thread somewhere, I just didn't feel like looking it up again.

skybert @ 1/2/2002 5:45:43 PM (5673):
noticed that bug too, but it has only occured while flying... never happened while hunting...

when it happened, I tried zoning in a bit, and when switching to 1st person and back to 3rd again, my sight is back at the end of the zone.

skybert @ 1/2/2002 5:51:41 PM (5828):
yup.

to make his shield go away, make him move, or get a trader or something to debuff him. Still takes some time to kill though...

btw, the loot you get from the other mobs in there are also good. mostly nodrop's, but good nodrops.

Ampris @ 1/2/2002 6:14:03 PM (Bugs with Omni-Med Clothing 5879):
The Omni-Med Female Suit Shirt only increases the First Aid skill.  The items description seems to indicate that it should also raise the Treatment skill when worn.

Both the Omni-Med Suit Skirt and Omni-Med Suit Trousers fail to raise the wearers First Aid and Treatment skills.

Finally, none of the Omni-Med Suit clothing has an Omni requirement.  However, the Omni-Med Cloak is Omni only.

Is the lack of an Omni only requirement on the Omni-Med suit an oversight?

MaDezzie @ 1/2/2002 7:53:40 PM (5879):
Also, the Omni-Med cloak has no benefits.  Is this just an oversight, or was it planned to have no benefits?

megaram @ 1/2/2002 8:25:25 PM (5831):
I've noticed that there is a pattern on what missions you get... (I had nothing else better to do)

when you get the "easy" mission, the very next mission you run will be a "Very hard" mission. This pattern rotates about every 5-8 missions you do. (give or take 1-2)

they rest vary on difficulty but non with that extreme easiness or difficulty, at least to my experience.

Bionitrous @ 1/2/2002 8:37:44 PM (3234):
I tell you what ... after not playing for 4 months and managing to find a lvl33 Yalmaha in a chest after only an hour or two of being back, I'm scared to death of losing it through some sort of bug.

It seems that you should _never_ place your vehicle in any container other than your inventory or maybe the bank.

Also I hear that whenever possible don't zone while flying.  This is apparently especially true when entering missions or shops.

The difficulty with not getting these items returned is that the only way to lose them is to destroy them or have them glitch out of your character's database in some bizarre way.  I've taken screen shots with time/date info but apparently the newer tracking measures added a while back make these actions redundant.  Seems the GM's can very well see that you used to have a car and now don't yet still refuse to help you out.

I really would like to see an insurance salesman that will sell you a form that will replace your vehicle (or other valuable NODROP item) if it is lost or accidently destroyed.  Since items are supposed to have unique ID's now (since early 12.x, I think), executing the form could simply do a server search for the vehicle it is bound to and replace it in a timely fashion once it is satified that the vehicle does not exist elsewhere on the planet.  One would have to lose BOTH the item AND the insurance contract to be completely out of luck.  I'd feel a lot safer with the knowledge that I had my policy in the bank.

peterrjg @ 1/2/2002 9:48:35 PM (5290):
Well, NPC pet professions don't have pets either. Imagine fighting that seasoned bureaucrat or MP only to have his pets beating on you as well.

I've been "fast attacked" in missions and by outside mobs but none of the other specials.

well.. i toke this mission in Tir that said i should treat some wounded ppl.. but huh ?.. no wounded ppl ?.. i coulden find any... i killed OT's but no wounded ppl. ? could this be a bug ?

Yyerinfahr @ 1/2/2002 11:11:33 PM (SMG Kits 5916):
Yes, it has been said before.  It will be said again.  SMG construction kits are still busted.

Ok, as a fixer, I have a long list of complaints, lets not go into them, let me just say however that a fixer's SMG is his livelihood if he doesn't have grid armor.  Given that the aleph does energy and the Patiriot does fire, I desperately want to give these a try - at least so the weapon looks and sounds a little different from all the other fixers.

So, with my new fixer, I thought I'd get try some new smgs.  So before I started him, I created an engineer, leveled them to 40, and tried constructing a few low level guns.  Niether the Aleph or the Patriot or the Duke (which I did not find a construction manual for) were able to be constructed.  I even tried to find another engineer to give it a try, just incase I was a moron about thier construction.  However, in no way could he or I get the construction kit to work.  The kit is still broken.  It doesn't work, and it ticks me off that there is no way to get a different gun other than the mausser if you are a clanner (the aleph at least available in the stores for the omnis).  Look, there is the slugger, but its not available at low levels, and the damage analysis done by many has shown that with the current damage/ac situation, it is near useless.  I want is a different gun.  I want some realistic method of getting it.  As a mission reward I got a QL6 patriot (at 6th level) but I was using a QL9 mausser.  I used the QL6 patriot regardless, as it at least looked and sounded different, and for the most part did comprable damage (though I know later it will not).  Now, with implants, buffs and whatnot, I should be able to use a gun generally about 7QLs above my level.  the problem is, there is no way that at my level I can run a mission like that, nor can I realistically know which levels have been seeded with SMGs for missions.  At later levels, I'll be using maussers 30-40 QLs above my level, and I will never see these as mission rewards because I won't be able to do those missions.  Effectively,  the 'new' SMGs are yet another thing not available to the fixer profession.

Barakon @ 1/3/2002 12:41:37 AM (Engie nano(Disruptive Photon Deflector) fatally bugged? 5920):
I just got this recently and was testing it out, I noticed this:


Before executing the nano, the mob was hitting me for 60-70 damage per second.

Shortly after executing the nano the mob started hitting me for 120-130 damage every hit per second!


I started getting a sneaking feeling this was bugged when last night I used it at the borg camp in Tir. I used it for the first time about an hour after our group had been fighting there. Shortly after I activated it, a lone borg demicated the entire group(just an orange cyborg technician), I noticed it hit our doc for 777 damage in one hit! and was hitting everyone else for 200-400 per hit. 


yes i'm really glad i wasted 14000 ip raising a useless dark skill to use this mob-friendly aura nano..

zeroframerate @ 1/3/2002 12:56:29 AM (5908):
Were you actually looking for actual NPCs to be wandering around wounded?

Just curious because all the missions I've taken like that require attaching some device to some chamber-like machine that the person is in ... no actual people wandering about.

zeroframerate @ 1/3/2002 12:59:37 AM (5673):
The camera needs a ton of work in this game. The thing is so amazingly annoying to operate and control. The Fixed camera is anything BUT that.

Drives me nuts that I can't adjust the height of the camera as well.

Funcom: get an employee to play DAoC and see how that camera works. You'll see what a real fixed camera is supposed to act like.

FireC @ 1/3/2002 2:42:14 AM (Grid bug? 5927):
I'm not sure if this has been discussed earlier, but it sure is annoying. Every time I use the grid it will tell me "your computer literacy skill needs to be higher than ___" even when I have enough skill (I do get out of the grid at the place I wanted to go luckily enough). It would be ok as it kind of teaches you the requirements to exit to certain locations, but as it tells you the same thing about ten times it makes me feel something must be wrong.

blu789 @ 1/3/2002 5:51:40 AM (Get Rid Of The Brown Cave Missions 5935):
1. Mobs that die on green slime don't give XPs.
2. Casting new pets sometimes causes them to get stuck in walls.
3. Pathing is slow and annoying (even using the /behind command)
4. Water doesn't work right.  Pathing is bad.

blu789 @ 1/3/2002 5:57:47 AM (5801):
I am in the process of doing a mission, and I'm pretty pissed off.

3 mobs, from 2 *different* rooms added to the 2 I was already fighting.  I was not near a door.  I did not have line of sight to the other mobs at all.  My pets were in the middle of the "current" room fighting two monsters.

So now I have 5 monsters in the same room.  Well, I lost 2 hours of work and my patience.

On top of it, when I come back to finish the mission, monsters that die on green slime DON'T GIVE XPs!

So not only do I lose 200,000 xps and 2 hours of work, the next 4 mobs I kill didn't give me anything either.

ARGH!

blu789 @ 1/3/2002 6:20:18 AM (5935):
When you zone into a brown cave missions, pets are often stuck in walls in the first room.  You can't give commands to pets stuck in walls.

And if you cast a pet from the starting position, it will get stuck in a wall too.

This isn't normally a problem, EXCEPT when there is a mob in the starting room.  Why do brown cave missions often start with a mob in the room with the exit?

I have been seeing this problems in missions - I think it has something to do with the playfield geometry, as it tends to be the same places in missions (rooms with sofa/shelves, table, three doors).  Its very annoying, and I've died because of it.  Its best just to switch to 1st person view until you're out of the bad area.

Ampris @ 1/3/2002 8:52:12 PM (5125):
I was unable to replicate this problem.  I was able to open a backpack and move items from main inventory into the backpack without the Overflow window closing.

Did you happen to open two containers simultaneously while the Overflow window was open?

I don't think you are able to have more than two containers open simultaneously.  Opening another container seems to cause one of the previously opened ones to close.  I can only speculate that this might be what caused the Overflow window to close on you.

In 2 days I've lost over 4 levels worth of XPs, due to STUPID BUGS.

You should reconsider reimplementing XPs pills as you guys were thinking about, because I'm so damn tired of pathing bugs, mobs shooting through walls, multiple mobs aggroing when you are 2 rooms away, and other stupid crap getting me killed.

I've been stuck at this damn title max max for almost 2 weeks.

Salageo @ 1/4/2002 2:11:38 AM (Starting attack failed... 6036):
I have a lvl 85 MA that as of right now hunts borgs in Mort. Now from what I have seen I'm not he only one that this has happened to.

After killing a MOB, but not for everything that is killed, I will sometimes get starting attack failed and after ticks of that I find my self at the ever infamous Insurance Terminal.  I know it's no profession related since I've seen it happen to other players.  This is somthing IMO that really needs to be looked into seriously and correct me if it is.  I find it real annoying that after everyother kill I'm having to run to a Cell Scanner to save and run back only to be killed by the same bug.  If anyone else has experienced please post replies to this thread so that it might be looked at.  I'll try to post some screenshots of this later on.

When a layer damage shield nano is buffing you, Rage will not be able to trigger a root breaking, since the shield absorbs the Rage damages.

It's maybe not a bug, and it may be intended to work that way. Still it's dubious and we would be glad to have an official answer on this one.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/4/2002 10:29:43 AM (Workaround for leftover roots! (But may cause bug!) 6069):
Here's a workaround for the problem where you get rooted just before the MOB dies, which usually means you stand there twiddling your thumbs waiting for the root to wear off:

Workaround:

This only works if you have enough HP to spare.  When the MOB has almost no HP left and roots you, hit "Q" to stop combat.  The root will usually get cancelled as soon as the MOB hits you once or twice.  You'll automatically hit back, which hopefully kills the MOB before it can root you again.  This worked several times for me tonight. 

Bug:

The only problem is that hitting "Q" several times near the end of a fight sometimes triggers the following bug (at least it does for me).  Suddenly I can't use treatments, first aid, or loot the corpse until I zone out and then back in again.  This cost me about 20k XP tonight, because another MOB rooted me while I was trying to run out of the mission area.  It killed me.  I could have survived the fight easily if I could have used my first aid kits, but the game wouldn't let me.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/4/2002 10:43:17 AM (Ghost MOB and gun shoots blanks 6071):
Shooting blanks:

My agent's rifle almost always shoots blanks along with bullets.  In other words, when my agent shoots her rifle, she almost always takes two shots at a time.  But even though the animation shows those two shots, she never hits the MOB twice -- and she only uses up one bullet from the clip. 

Ghost MOB after an auto reload/manual reload:

When automatic reload starts the gun shoots several "blanks" in a row before it actually reloads.  I can stop those "blank runs" by manually reloading the rifle.  If the MOB happens to die during this manual reload, then the MOB's HP bar suddenly jumps up in the air as if the dead MOB stood up again.  And then it drops down to the floor once again as if the ghost MOB re-died, and I get my XP.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/4/2002 10:54:16 AM (MOB attacks with gun while casting nanos 6072):
Lately I noticed that MOBs cast nanos (such as a healing nano), and when they're done suddenly 1-3 red damage messages appear as if they were continuing to shoot while casting the nano.   Neat trick if we could do it, too, but we can't.

Hi!

I'm not sure this is a bug, nor if it has been anounced earlier on theese threads. Thing is, when i went to NL general store just to buy som nanorechargers i saw a engineer pet attack a player in the shops, offcourse i immediately attacked the pet who was green to me (im lvl 75 dr btw) and allmost killed it. It zoned out of the store before i capped the bastard 

I tried to send /petition about it and ask, but it took to long for me to get an answer reguarding this issue.

Anyone know how this could happen? I have allways thought that if you enter a shop you shouldn't get attacked. Feel free to send a /tell to drwizzz anytime.

Thx for your help!!

Krneki @ 1/4/2002 12:04:41 PM (6073):
If an engineer leaves the bot in another zone (logs out, issue /pet wait and leave the zone, etc), it becomes a normal NPC monster. So you can attack it since shops are 75% zones.

Barakon @ 1/4/2002 1:35:48 PM (Okie, MOB view distances in various zones.. whats the deal with this??! 6079):
A while back is when this started to happen on Rubi Ka 1, in quite a few zones, you can only see MOBs when you are practically in their face. They fade in and out of view at a very close range. I have avoided saying anything about this previously since its such an obvious glitch and thought you'd have it fixed by now. It leads to constant adds when you attack non-aggro mobs and a quick death when you run into groups of aggro mobs, from not being able to see them.

Also I know its not just me, my friends and other ppl I have teamed with experienced the same thing, plus, the afflicted zones are generally deserted. Furthermore, I logged on one of my old chars on Rubi Ka 2 and did not experience this problem in the same zones.


Zones where I constantly experience this problem:

Wailing wastes
Clon****
Longest road
Andromeda
There are others but can't remember them offhand.

You hardly ever see anyone in these zones either, is this what you want? half the gameworld deserted?

This is very bad.  Zaal is the only char if mine witha yalmaha so its not an issue for him.  BUT -

Taebo @ 1/4/2002 8:33:55 PM (5801):
This seems more common in those Cave missions. Getting around them sometimes is a real pain in the butt. Especially with those broken bridges in the rooms without water, or fallen down pillars and beams. It looks cool, but somethings you can walk through, somethings you can't.

It would be cool if cave missions were changed, to a smoothed wall cave like place, kind of like an AC dungeon, that meandered about like a real cave. That would be better than a huge square room with doors on every side that don't make sense as to their location. We need long hallways, and monsters at intersections.

In the 'office' or 'warehouse' type missions, I have no problems with mobs in walls or getting through it.

Jack_McGreed @ 1/4/2002 9:08:27 PM (How about a broken tradeskill list? 6113):
I was just wondering, if we shouldn't have an list over trade skills which actually works at current time, and an list over those which is broken. Im personally tired of buying parts and manuals, and then after a couple of steps (when im lucky) gets an "Wrong Order" or something like that.

So, anyone who has SUCCEED in making an item/weapon, please post it here, or redirect to another place where you can see what works and what doesnt. So we don't have to search the forum each time we find something new to work out.

Oh yeah, almost forgot, some times in a mission, the NPCs gets stucked into a wall, but can still shoot and hit me, but I can't target or shoot the NPC, because I can't 'see' them. Bummer...always have to leave the mission area before they get unstucked.

Zaal @ 1/4/2002 9:52:30 PM (5801):
I will tell you what I THINK this is.

MOB visual accuity has been hightened and they are no longer limited in scope to one single room.  

If you attack mobs in the opening room there are other wandering MOBS that are in other rooms that respond to your attack as well because they are general spawn MOBS to the main big room.  Others that aggro are from the edge of doors that are open and can "see" your attack on the main room mobs.

My game-play fix:

DONT ATTACK THE MOB.  I edge my way into the main chamber.  I let one of them see me and aggro on me and I try like hell not to attack and hit him until I get him into the opening small room that you spawn into the mission in.  If he gets caught on a door, I zone out and come back in.  Then if he's not already in the room walking around I try again, and it generally works.  You need to get them out of the main room.  Fighting in that room for some reason is a trouble magnet for any mob in adjoining rooms.

My two creds - do with it what you will.

I never had the problem with extra mobs from side rooms joining in untill I got above lvl 45. Now mobs from at least two if not three side rooms join in the fight, giving me 5 or 6 mobs to try to kill. 

Also I haven't done a cave mission in a long while.

Edit: Zaal's method of letting them agro before attacking does wonders no mater where you are. You just don't get the first shot off.  I like to let one aggro, then lead it to a "safe" place to kill it.

Zaal @ 1/4/2002 10:00:57 PM (5801):
Yeah it does!  U just gotta get out of line of sight with them and they will run to you.

hobbes @ 1/4/2002 10:02:34 PM (inverse reet 6118):
If you enter a mission/building with the reet nano running, it will give you a reverse reet( -190 run speed,-evade,-swim, etc.). This is the same type of proble as the reverse flurry of blows.

Bruzar @ 1/4/2002 10:20:20 PM (The Kodiak 6120):
In 3rd person view the front moves from left to right constantly....just thought i would mention it.  Not a knock to the people that own the planes....but if the Yalms were busted...a patch fix, workaround would be issued quick i'm sure.   I just want my busted hoopty to work.

edit- I would give it to an NT but I don't think they have the mechanic  tradeskill yet.

Atrocious @ 1/4/2002 10:47:02 PM (Two strange bugs. 6124):
Bug number 1 is strangest. Here it goes:

Whenever I log in and I zone from an indoor zone to an outdoor zone I get disconnected. After I relog in, I never get disconnected when zoning from indoor to outdoors.

This usualy happen when I log on, run to get some ammo or kits in a store, then when I exit I loose conn 95% of the time. I think there has been 2-5 times I have not lost conn.


Bug number 2:

When trying to sort and rearrange all the items I have in my bankbox I sometimes get phantom backpacks in my bankbox. This almost always happen when I have a full inventory and remove one bag, and grab another. If I have two or more slot available then this does not happen.

hobbes @ 1/4/2002 11:30:09 PM (6120):
Does it still do that if you stop, then hit the INS key( or whatever key you use for automatically going forward). That stops my kodiak from wobbling.

Bruzar @ 1/5/2002 12:05:04 AM (6120):
it stops when I hit x and sit down.

Barakon @ 1/5/2002 12:24:28 AM (6079):
Its not just being able to travel through these zones without dying every 5 mins due to stepping on some 'unseen' aggro mob thats an issue, there are a lot of great hunting areas which are completely FUBAR because of this...

Wailing wastes has giant spiders, scorpiods, the odd vulture and a large settlement of Yuottos and Outtos.

Longest road has lots: Large groups of Lifebleeders and Lifestealers, large groups of Yuottos and Outtos, large groups of Hammer beasts, etc..

Clon**** has the famous(or infamous) spider mine.

Andromeda has lots of good stuff to fight also, wolves, bigcats, spiders, etc..

So since these areas are pretty much deserted by hunting groups, you see places like 20k turning into lag-ridden, overpopulated zones..

Again to reiterate, this is not a problem I experience on Rubi Ka 2, however my friends don't want to play on that 'ghost-town' dimension of servers, so I can't just reroll there(even if i had the inclination, which i don't have much anymore).

What I would like is some official acknowledgement of this 'problem' and the assurance that a 'solution' is being worked on.

Krneki @ 1/5/2002 11:05:19 AM (6113):
There are a few threads about broken and working weapons in the Engineer forum, but not all i'm afraid. what Funcom needs to do is get a team of 3 QAs and tell each to build his 1/3 of weapons and check which are working and which are not. I'm slowly tired of getting this done myself, because it wastes my cash not to mention time. QAs can summon items they need (they often complain that the database is huge and takes time to bring up, yadda, yadda...) so they can do it much faster without any cash loss (duh!) not to mention gettin paid.

for the 2nd part about NPCs being stuck and such stuff...check this  thread

Kithraks @ 1/5/2002 2:40:55 PM (I lost my crat suit due to a bug! 6187):
I have had it with these recent bugs that have effictively erased almost a week's worth of effort.

First off, I lost 220k xp after I saved at an insurance terminal, found that I was stuck in my Yamalha so I relogged. Upon relogging I find myself with 1 hp, full nano and lost all my xp as if I didn't save....great.

It wasn't so bad until today, 1 day later when I was trying to look for my nodrop crat suit in the usual place and its not there. Now, I've looked everywhere and double checked to make sure its not misplaced but as of right now, I have effectively lost my ql 80 OT crat suit!

I have a su****ion it has to do with my being stuck in Yama then the odd death on relog. I have proof that I own the item via a item refrence that I've made of the suit and the steps for the items that lead to it.

Funcom needs to give an explaination and refund the missing crat suit. After all the work I have contributed to the AO community as host to the Bureaucrat Conventions and the director of a guild these serious bugs that have erased a significant investment of time is most disconcerning.

LRRH @ 1/5/2002 3:48:49 PM (No destination in mission description for 100% Phys/75% Head On 6189):
Pretty much sums it up. The top three entries are assassinations, and they don't tell you where you're supposed to go. You can still load the coordinates and try and figure it out yourself, but it's annoying.

LRRH @ 1/5/2002 3:51:47 PM (*mob name*'s casting of NameMissing was interrupted by *player name* 6190):
Been getting this often. The first assumption is that it's simply a mob trying to cast a nano and the program reading the name wrong or something. However, I'm getting it with things like Waste Collectors and Probes and such, mechanical units which never cast anything.

I'm playing an MA, and using fists. I can't reproduce it on command, but it happens at least a few times a mission.

Zaal @ 1/5/2002 4:22:25 PM (6190):
My MA gets this all the time too.  I figger its a MOB thing that only they get.  You know how they have superior pistols and HP.  They prolly get NF's that we don't get too.

Zaal @ 1/5/2002 4:24:07 PM (6187):
Petition in game.  People can get lost vehicles back now, so you may get your suit back too.  Don't know tho; it seems they made a "parking lot" for lost vehicles.

Hamini @ 1/6/2002 2:43:26 AM (5927):
its happens when you zone out of backyards(n00b zones).

you must be level 2 or have 1000 credits to exit the backyard

Hamini @ 1/6/2002 2:46:07 AM (5828):
what i think is outrageous is that you need at least a lvl 60 group to go through a dungeon thats lvl 30-50.....that or a doc.  I mean i realize that these things are suppose to be a challenge, but a lvl 45 team w/o a doc isnt going to have a chance in hell.  And if they do have a doc its going to take them about 3 hours to kill about 40 green mobs, because they have way too many hp.

Hamini @ 1/6/2002 2:47:41 AM (6071):

In combat I've noticed that you'll start attacking about half as fast as normally, not shoot normally like you would as if you had set it to full def or full agg... if you slide the slider around, then slide it back, it will fix it for about 15 minutes... then you have to do it again.  It gets very annoying and has costed me about 15 lives and at least 3 levels tonight :/

this is what happened:

I was in my plane hovering above the Skilled Bot Hacker Camp in 20K. I went to eat, and i come back to find that a "You've been disconnected" server error has occured message. When i relog I'M SITTING ON THE GROUND. Its like WTF? who was sick enough to take my plane off and sit me down??? Well I'm about to find out of funcom is going to take care of this. Funny thing is, I'm expected to write a review for this game for a German game magazine. Its due in three days, and this just happened. We'll see what happens...

Nianna @ 1/6/2002 5:55:33 PM (6113):
So many of the weapons are broken its hardly worth trying anymore.  I can never build anything.  They need some serious QA work on the weapon trade skill.  Failed like the last 8 different weapons I've tried now due to them being broken.

I'm a level 123 trader and I'm quite aware of how the trade skills work.  I do several other trade skills with no problem.  All the items are higher QL than the kit as required and most often I reach a step where I add the item and no combination takes place, there's no error or failure message, and I still have the two items I tried to combine.

I've been waiting for ages for this trade to be useful.  At lower levels building weapons worked, but they were all useless compared to what stores sell.  Now I've finally reached a high enough level that I could construct level 130+ weapons that might actually be useful since shops dont sell any weapons above level 125, but now I can't seem to build anything.  I think they messed up the weapon trade when they added the new weapon types.

Tatterjack @ 1/7/2002 10:05:53 AM (pet bug 6341):
Here's a good one. I spent 45k of my remaning 50k on a Patchwork Gladiator bot, ql 50. Requirements are 241 Time & Space and 241 Matter Creation. My MC was 241 and TS 243 (with buffs). I was able to create the shell ok, but on examination it turns out to somehow be only a level 49, and requires 245 TS & MC!
So, I am now broke, and lumbered with a useless piece of junk.

Barakon @ 1/7/2002 11:32:44 AM (6341):
I believe it to be intentional to stop engies from becoming too powerful on their own buffs.

It gets worse too, I uploaded one and made the shell... the shell was almost 10 lvls lower than the nano! Every single one after lvl 50 that i've seen is like that, except maybe 1 or 2 which where a tad higher(which seems more likely to be the bug).

Holinor @ 1/7/2002 1:47:54 PM (New guidelines for bug forum 6356):
It seems we will need some new guidelines for this forum:

1. When you find and report a bug, do not expect an answer

2. Any reported bugs will be promtly dismissed as 
A: a cheater trying to destroy the game 
B: And exploiter with a diabolic plan 
C: Any kind of terrorist organisation trying to spread confusion
D: A drunken Teletubbie writing in the wrong forum

3. All info on bugs will be ignored with the highest efficency, do not expect anything to change in the game because of it.

4. For every major bug reported, of such magnitude that players leave the game, we will open up a new bar somewhere in the wilderness.

5. You do not count, your input does not count. We did not listen to the beta testers, why the poop would we listen to you?!

6. Your money is spent on marketing consultants, so do not tell us we do not do anything for you. We  have just printed up kewl T-shirts..

7. No, you can not have a T-shirt. We sell them expensivly, or give them to Computer magazines so they will give us good press.

8. Oh.. and give us more money. Consultants are expensive.

Funcom.. That people leave this game has nothing to do with marketing or bad commersials. That the population do not rise in this game has nothing to do with how many complete fools you have telling people to cheer up when the game messes up. 

Your policy as a general makes people leave.. your priorities makes people leave. You leave the bugs, and work on dolls and bars. You let people see all their hard earned equipment, months of work, disappear, and you tell them you will do nothing.. If even one of the numerous appointed answers, that is. Oh, by the way, sucker... Smile!

Here is your real policy. The one we, as playing costumers see. Can you see anything wrong with it?

zeroframerate @ 1/7/2002 4:33:32 PM (Chat bug: how friends get bumped. 6378):
I'm sure this has been brought up before, but this is always what happens to me:

I've a list of accepted friends. If one of those friends sends me a message whilst I'm not logged on, upon me logging in that friend will be bumped to the unaccepted list. Every friend that I receive a message from offline will always be bumped to the unaccepted list and I'll have to re-accept them.

I dunno why this happens but it's rather annoying.

Fixy fixy?

Zaal @ 1/7/2002 6:10:44 PM (5631):
It happens occasionally and infrequently and i just look at it as the easy money mission.  Take it and run.  It doesn't happen often.

MORB @ 1/7/2002 6:54:44 PM (6378):
One of my friend gets kicked all the time from the accepted list... He crashes a lot, and most of the times he does so, he gets kicked.

I had another annoying bug that may be related, where that's me who crashed, and my friend was put on ignore. (It took me 15 minutes to understand what was going on - my friend was unusually silent, then at some point he logged and came back. I finally clicked on him and saw the big "IGNORED" over his name)

Doctorkain @ 1/7/2002 7:40:34 PM (6187):
Ah, it's Kith...

Yeah, he had a crat suit - he was incidentally showing it off, quite proudly just before me, him, and a few friends ran off to Steps of Madness to camp up a couple of Neleb Cloaks.

Hey Funcom? He had a suit. I know this, everyone in his guild knew it, and he's got references apparently as well (I'm sure he made them when he was telling his fellow guild members how they could go about getting their own).

But I know you won't give it back, and there goes one more player.

Doctorkain @ 1/7/2002 7:46:30 PM (6124):
I had the zoning indoors to outdoors bug too. Fine zoning in, zoning out of ANY indoors-type playfield timed out.

Support told me they'd never heard of the problem and nothing else (Ie, 'go away, it's user error you idiot'). Went away later randomly. It started occuring after a strange lag death that made me entirely unable to enter the 2HO zone period (apparently I had two existances on the server, one where I was and one just standing around motionless in 2HO), which was fixed by the support staff.

Not likely any of the above helps you, but hope you have more information as ammo now.

Ulakai @ 1/7/2002 7:57:39 PM (Missing hits when mob gets to 1/4 health 6407):
Whats with this bug???? I've spoken to a few people before posting this, so I know it's not just me.

I'm a lev 84 adv using q114 riders (can self equip without any buffs (no biggie just ruling that out) ). When I get a mob down to 1/4 energy I suddenly start missing the mob - hits dont register at all, the only way to hit is using brawl - this is no matter how easily i beat the bob down (green, yellow and orange) at around 1/4 i swing with my riders/ swipe with my claws (grinning hunter) but keep missing - this starts making easy fights very close, and harder fights pure chance - at about 1/4 i have to start chain healing myself praying that hits will strike - it's like the mobs evade skills shoot up - they still hit me consistantly and theres nothing i can do to strike back. I believe this should be adressed urgently.

SecretAgentMan @ 1/7/2002 8:33:12 PM (6124):
If you're having strange crashing errors, here's what I've learned from experimenting and from my guild mates:

If the strange crashes affects only one of your chars:
If you can afford the time to reset your macros and shortcut bars, find your character's prefs directory and blow it away.  Press F9 and look for CharID XXXXXX:yyyyyyyyyyy, that yyyyyyyyyyy part is your character ID #. Look in your AO directory for a Prefs directory, inside of that is a directory named after your account name, and in that are directories for each of your chars.  Find the one labelled Charyyyyyyyyyy that matches that character's ID and delete that directory.   Next time you start it will create a new directory, and you'll have to reset your in-game graphics settings, macros and shortcut bars, but that should fix it if it only happens on that one char.  

If it happens when you login with a specific character:
It's possible that your character logged out in a 'bad' spot and needs to be moved by a GM, so log in with a different character and use the petition command to let them know what's going on.

If the crashes affect all your chars:
1) Check your RAM, 128 MB is not enough (IMHO), 256 is bare minimum and 512 is ideal.  I run 384 MB of RAM and it is sufficient for several hours of uninterrrupted play.

2) Check your available HD space on the drive where your swap file is located, and free up as much space as you can - delete your temporary internet files, delete the stuff in your Temp directories, empty your recycle bin, etc.  I have a minimum of 6 GB available at any time, so I'm not sure what the minimum needed is.

3) Check your video drivers for the latest version, if you're using an nVidia card, the most stable driver version (according to me and my friends' personal experience) is 21.83, newer versions are known to cause problems with crashing in AO, even though they work fine in most other games.  I downgraded to 21.83 and this has made a *huge* difference for me as far as stability goes.  Here's the link for 95/98 versions http://www.nvidia.com/view.asp?PAGE=pg_20010907943252

4) If you ran SpeedRead after the last patch, try re-running it and Deleting the update database to see if that fixes the crashing, SpeedRead doesn't work well on all PCs.  If that fixes it, try running it again and see if maybe you just had a buggy database, if it starts crashing again, just delete the db again and hope it gets fixed in a future patch.

5) Knock your video resolution down a notch, I can play at higher resolutions, but it starts slowing down and will crash eventually, I assume due to greater resource utilization.  I play in a 1024x768 window on a 1152x864 desktop and it's smooth.

If you know of other fixes, please post them here as well.

Atrocious @ 1/7/2002 9:19:52 PM (6124):
I only play one of my chars now, so maybe I'll do a bit more with two others I have.

The crash after first store/indoor arena happens on all my chars.

I have all the latest updates, drivers, etc. I think my problem is related to Win2k. Not sure tho. It also only happens with me, not with anyone else of my guild mates.

Atrocious @ 1/7/2002 9:21:45 PM (6378):
People I have accepted that send me messages when I'm offline get dumped to unaccepted.


Doesn't really bother me, but would be a nice fix.

Then they should remove references to the First Aid and Treatment modifiers from the affected items.  That would 'fix' them, as it would then be clear that they are not supposed to increase any skills.

LRRH @ 1/8/2002 7:10:38 AM (Neutral mission locations fillied with named/civilian mobs 6462):
This has happened twice in two days with a new character I made on RK 2. Once in the Newland, once in Stret West Bank/Last Ditch.

Basically, 99% of the mobs in the mission are named like off-the-street civilians in any city or town. They're dressed like it too, in all those scattered, terrible fashions. ;) No weapons, just fist fighters.

I played a neutral agent up to level 25 or so on RK1 and never had this happen. Anyone else run into this?

nanokat @ 1/8/2002 9:38:38 AM (Group heals interrupting attacks 6474):
What's the story on this Bug or "new feature"!

If you use a slow weapon in a group where group heal is cast a lot, the heal effect will interrupt and reset your weapon attacks.  Watch your attack bar and with a medium speed weapon you can lose 1 in 3 attacks.  I used a stiener once in a group heal situation and the heal interrupted every attempt to attack with the stiener.

This bug needs to be addressed.  At 100+ levels gropup heal is often cast non-stop in combat situations, making slow weapon users at an extreme disadvantage.

LRRH @ 1/8/2002 9:45:04 AM (6474):
I would think it's working as intended.

Attack time = aiming the weapon, pulling the trigger, bullet/slug/whatever leaving the weapon.

Recharge time = ejecting shell, nano recharge, et cetera.

It makes little sense that you could get halfway through aiming a weapon, then just sort of pause in the middle of it, run a complicated nano program, and you can just pick up with your attack where you left off.

BTW, seriously, fix the flurry of fists, it randomly decreases melee init, decreases run speed, swim speed, Evade and ducking until you zone out. 
			
		
	
My guess is you're just lucky 

About the skill decrease, that happens to me if I zone indoors while in bird form. The skills that the bird form adds (runspeed, swimspeed, evades etc) get lowered twice instead of just once. Solution : zone, or terminate bird form before you enter a building.

Krneki @ 1/8/2002 11:36:42 AM (6341):
Nano Crystal's QL doesn't reflect the lvl of the pet. Never has and never will. At your lvl, you will see that every next pet is 3 lvls higher then the one b4 him.

There are a few screwups where you have enough skill to upload, summon the shell, but you don't have enough to activate the bot. That's a pain in the ass.

It's no nerf. What would you say to a QL 189 nano crystal for a slayerdroid guardian, which turns out to be a lvl 200 bot?

You are right, Reality.

At the time of my initial post, I happened to be suffering from the negative reet AND the negative "fists" at the same time.  I attributed it all to "fists" as I had not yet realized the other problem. Now. I am familiar with negative reet and abort that nano before entering missions.

There are a whole host of these "opposite image problems", we have just touched on 2. Seems to be a basic programming error, but that's not my field. I find that when the delay nanos cast on me run out, I get a mirror opposite speed boost. I was running around a cave at 972 run speed. So this is not only a mirror image problem, but an additive one, as two different mobs had the same spell on me.

Please fix all above, thanks.

svensken @ 1/8/2002 4:10:40 PM (Trade bug 6515):
Time: Around UTC Jan 08 00:10:00 2002
Location: The whompa in Avalon. Dimension 2
Characters involved: RazorKnuckle and BrightSun

Brightsun was helping me assembling implants.
Her INV was almost full (I didn't know that).
My INV was almost full.
I gave her the stuff from a backpack and pressed Accept.
AO states that her INV is full and the trade was cancelled.
I press cancel.

The stuff disappeared. She only got 2 items. Which she gave back to me.
I tried zoning a few times, but to no avail.
I tried relogging, didn't work.
Looked in the bank, but nothing there.

I petitioned, an ARK came and said that basically You don't replace lost items!?!?
The stuff was _expensive_ to me!!
I want it back!

The implants were QL90 and the Cluster ranged between 92 and 157.
Don't care what QL i get back as long they are at least 90 so I can create my QL90 implants.

Implants missing:
LEFT ARM QL90
LEFT WRIST QL90
LEG QL90

Clusters missing:
Shining Smashing >QL90
Bright Strength >QL90
Faded Quickness >QL90
Shining Ambidexterity >QL90
Faded Nanite Resist >QL90
Shining Nimbleness >QL90
Brigth Endurance >QL90
Faded High Body Development >QL90
Brigth Fire Protection >QL90
Faded Inner Fire >QL90

Prefer to get the stuff, but second option is cash to buy them once more. But then I want enough so I don't have to camp the shops for days!

This _is_ a bug, the game should have put the stuff back in my backpack. Not delete it.

Zaal @ 1/8/2002 4:41:29 PM (6446):
... and I will say it again.  FC needs to make all zoning occur 100% zones (unless its going into a mission.)

Kwangju @ 1/8/2002 4:44:37 PM (6446):
Yes as a matter of fact it has.  A fellow guild member zoned into 2HO, and he was slautered before the PvP grace period was done timing out.  As soon as he zoned in, some text came up stating that he was attcking someone. Then, he was killed by 5 campers.  

He tried to grid in again, to make positive that he was not targeting/attacking anyone.  As soon as he zoned, the game said he was attacking someone, and the same OT lamers were killing him again.

Somehow they are able to cause him to attack, is it that an OT Enforcer did a Mongo Slam or something, and my friends aggro bar is full right, I am not sure.

Kwangju @ 1/8/2002 4:59:48 PM (3234):
Something similar happened.   Went on a mission for the cool Grid armor Fixer nano.  Got the nano, but it would not upload at all.  Sent a petition to the GM.  GM looked at nano, tried to upload it himself, and could not.  Says "Wow, you are right, this nano is bugged.  Sorry though, can't give you a new one, or give you credits in compensation."

The same crap has happened to me, and server crashes 10 min after a trade, that deleted the following:

5 slot belt
5 very high ql NCUs
high ql Decus coat
Assorted high ql armor

These items disapeared from all characters, I know cuz i have two comps and was trading them to myself.

And one loss that I could not prove, GM said if only I had a screen shot of the Yalm in the chest, but could not help me since I had no screen shot:

ql 55 Yalmaha that was in a chest, and disapeared.

But really now, would the GM have given me a Yalmaha to replace the one that disapeared?  I submit that they would not.

Ampris @ 1/8/2002 5:19:28 PM (6446):
Report them using /petition as they are most likely using an exploit.

As well, they are also "rez killing" which to the best of my knowledge is not permitted.

Rez killing is different from zone/grid camping... rez killing is sitting at a reclaim terminal killing people continually as they rez. 

As for your friend getting attacked, one idea that has been tossed around is that the timer starts when the server begins to zone you, but the client side timer only starts once you zone...

i.e.
1. You start to exit grid, timer starts...tick...tick..tick 
2. You take about 10 secs to fully zone... you have 5 secs left
3. Timer on client side starts, shows 15 (time on server shows 5)
4. 5 secs later, you are open to attack.

Best way to fix this? I don't know. This whole timer thing is stupid anyway.
My solution would be a 2 minute invulnerabilitly, which ends the second you move. (i.e. you can sit there for 2 minutes safe, but the minute you move the grace period ends. Any longer than 2 minutes would be too long, would allow "spying" too easily.)

Provisioner @ 1/8/2002 5:43:49 PM (6446):
Dropcid,

It's pretty obviously this is what's happening.  The only solution is to start the timer when your client knows you have zoned, not the server.

In reality, who don't they just scrap the timer and make you open to attack after the first keystroke or movement...

Exactly! That would be my method.
However, What if you just sit there for an hour "spying"
What if 20 people just sit there? then, you'd have a hard time finding someone to attack. Hmm... that might make for an interesting peace rally... damn hippies!

That wouldn't be very fair, so there needs to be some limit, longer than 15 secs, but shorter than.... 5mins? I think 2 mins or the first keystroke/movement would be perfect.

By the way, this idea would lead to exploits beyond your wildest dreams. It would require the client side to tell the server when it's ready to start counting/be attacked. It would be a very bad idea to give the client side that much control.

On second thought, there may be nothing we can do about this at all. Might as well just get rid of the timers altogether. Stupid idea anyway. I never got that upset over getting camped anyhow. It was just a way of life with MMD and 2h0 (and occassionally 4holes)

nanokat @ 1/8/2002 6:17:19 PM (6474):
yeah, the key thing here is that someone else is healing you.

This interruption can happen with any speed weapon, if a heal effect resolves on you while your attack bar is recharging it interrupts you attack.  It's just more likely to happen when your weapon is slow.

If this is an intended effect then most slow weapons in the game just became worthless in high level group situations.   Some skill sets don't provide fast alternatives to replace the slow weapons, so a lot of people just got nerfed.

Provisioner @ 1/8/2002 7:14:18 PM (6446):
As for spying:  Doesn't matter.  You can easily fly out of attack range but still be in visible range with a yalm and good video card.  Most of the chatting tends to hand in OOC channels and shouts, so this make little difference.

As for exploits:  I don't think it would be exploitable.  AO still runs in "mother-may-I?" mode.  Meaning, you can do whatever the heck you want on the client, but the server still has to approve it.

In other words, you unplug your network and walk two steps.  Your client DID walk those two steps, but you never asked for permission to move nor did the server move you.

So, the moment that the server gets a command packet from you other than the packets being passed from the zone server, you are open for attack.

I really don't see any issues at all with plan, except graphic loading problems in high content area (so maybe give 5 seconds for the machine to load the graphics) :P

As I fly, I don't really have too much of an issue with the 15 second counter...IF it was 15 seconds, I could be in the next zone before my PvP counter ended (of course, maybe this was intended to prevent too many people from running to the next zone, I dunno).

LRRH @ 1/8/2002 8:50:20 PM (6474):
Nah, I just didn't understand from your post that someone else was doing the healing; wasn't entirely clear. ;)

So.. yes! Definitely bug-like. Nevermind. ;)

So, what if you unplug the network and walk 50 steps instead? Then, the client and server synch up and you are halfway across the zone before the server flips the switch.
Never, ever, trust the client.

That is exactly my issue with it! Why should you be safe for 15 secs to fly away as you wish, in this dangerous PvP zone? I am no longer afraid at all of 25% zones. This makes the game a LOT less exciting for me now. As I run along between 25% and 75% patches, no one ever has a chance at attacking me. It's too easy. I have no fear anymore. No fear = no fun. It's like killing leets your entire career. It would be easy... you'd never die... but it would be boring.

-D

Provisioner @ 1/8/2002 9:56:28 PM (6446):
As with any MMORPG, the issue isn't death, it's death by a totally unfair advantage.  In UO, it ws 7xGMs taking down newbie miners.  I'm not saying that this was how it should/shoun't have been, but it was just plain stupid.

We see the same thing here.  A member of the opposite faction waits for you to zone, KNOWS you can't fight back, and kills you.  That is not only unfair, it's just plain stupid...

If there is to be mass-transit into PvP zones, make them 75% (like MMD works - I like that).

Again, I don't mind dying (besides, I am very, VERY, proud of the restraint of both clan and omni forces when I grid into 2h0!  Typically, it's "Don't kill the neut" or "Let the neut go".  If someone DOES kill me, they usually send me a /tell saying "I'm sorry - didn't see that your were a neut".  I'll tell ya, people have REALLY changed towards neutrals!).  What I do mind is dying when bits of my being are being passed from server to server...

RoboKa @ 1/8/2002 10:23:17 PM (You cannot use that nano progrm at the moment. 6570):
Is this a bug? 

I cast the bot. 
I use the bot for awhile. 
At some point, when I try to heal the bot I get a message liek this: 
"You cannot use that nano progrm at the moment." 
Sometimes this goes away after awhile, some time the bot has to be killed (or termed) before I can (build and) heal a bot again. 
During the time that I can't real it, it seems that I can't use trimmers either... 

...what gives? 

For example: When things are working correctly, I use a tool bar button to run Rebuild Casing. When I left click it, the button goes grey (well pastel), the casting time begins, then the program execution, then recharge time and finally, the button ungreys, at which point I can rerun the program (and often do). This whole process takes less than a minute. 
When the situation dicussed above occurs, I will get the message "You cannot use this program at ehe moment..." (not exactly sure about the wording, except for the "at the moment" part) for 5 to 30 or more minutes. Its as if it gets stuck in the recharge cycle. 

p.s. I have check, I have not been debuffed during the period in question. All of my skills are just fine for casting the program or using the trimmer and yes, I do have enough nano energy available.

stifelife @ 1/9/2002 1:41:51 AM (Have the GMs gone the way of ARKS??!?? 6587):
We all know that ARKS are really nice to help us all out.  But lets face it.  They are useless.  If you want to get anything DONE, you have to bring it to a GM's attention.  Or maybe thats the way things used to be.  

   I have been playing AO for about 6 months now, through good times and bad.  I am a law abiding citizen and have upstanding moral character.  I have tuffed it through the loss of irreplacable items, (2 yalms) but i have realised, hey things cant be perfect. I took comfort in knowing that even though they were gone, if i rose enough stank about it, something may have happened.  Recently, I needed to change hunting grounds, since i required harder MOBS.  New area means better armor ect.  So i gathered a few MOTHERS together and we all had a party on a high level Primus Coat mission.  After a few hours, we went home and saw to it that the coat was safely in place on my back. Everything was hunkeedory, until that is i gridded from ent to 2HO.  In the midst of PVP, my fellow employees commenting on my interesting looking OMNI-POL skirt.  I looked past my sheilds sparkels and noticed something strange.  My coat was gone and my visuals were bugged.  I went through normal proceedings of logging, zoning, and finally petitioning.  Fellow ARK came along and told me what a freak occurance this was.  He assured me it woulndt, or shoulndt happen again, and that there was nothing he could do.  I could agree with that, hey, ive done it before.  So i craweled back into my guilds chat and begged for us to repeat the previous night.  This time to make sure that we had proof everyone took their SS's and i even passed the coat around.  Finally i got back to trade, buffed it on, and all was well again.  I zoned again, but this time it was still upon my back.  It was growing late in the night, and i had to log to bed.  I slept soundly, and the next day returned to see the coat was gone again, and the same visual bug on my character!  This was too far.  So i petitioned yet again, the ARK gave me his little run around.  I asked for a GM.  This was the first sighting of a GM in my life!  Well, actually he didnt bother to show up, for exaustion of typing in the commond i guess, but hey, this was a GM!  I told him the story of both of my coats and asked for some help.  He notified me that there was nothing he could do, and that "I reccomend you dont atempt to get another, the same may happen again."  Well, no $#%$ sherlock.  I asked kindly what could be done about this, he said to send in a bug report and he went away.  Being very unsatisfied, i messaged back asking that if he couldnt do anything about my items vanishing, at least he oculd help me with my visual bugs.  He did not even show up to take a look!  What kind of bold moral "Prince in shining armor was this???!"  I couldnt take anymore.  I logged immeadiatly facing the facts that since the GM's are now as useless and a whole lot more rude than ARKs, i may never where back armor again.  To this day you can see the evidence when you see the lumbering Atrox enforcer (Member) walkingaround in his visually bugged character.  Moral:  GM's are not the upstanding people you want them to be, not at all.

Kithraks @ 1/9/2002 2:23:29 AM (6187):
Guess what? After another half week of waiting the GM came back and told me that after checking with the database admin that there was no log of me ever having had a crat suit and that their extremely old save did not have me with my crat suit either.

Basically, they still don't believe me that I had a crat suit, and that it mysteriously dissappeared from my bag. I made references of both the nodrop form used to make the suit, and the nodrop suit itself, and their database says its not logged?!?

To summarize, they can ONLY replace lost Yamas, so even if they could prove I had the crat suit then suddenly have it dissappear due to no fault on my part they can't do anything about it. Heck, if I suddenly had everything deleted for no reason in front of the GM, they won't be able to compensate me for my loss.

So am trying for that suit again but I am VERY angry. If that guild raid on that dungeon don't turn up the form by Thursday I've had it. I would have effectively spent over a week trying to reacquire the item I should have had in the first place.

Hum, gee renewal coming up in Feb. I am not satisifed with this game's customer service at all. Oh well, at least I get to host one last bureaucrat convention before I go.

To the GM, nice try but your "efforts" didn't help solve my problem and complaint.

To Funcom, I can say from first hand experience that your customer service is *censored* messed up and *censored* you!

Kithraks @ 1/9/2002 2:25:23 AM (6587):

I have been on RK-2 for the most of the time and I have never experienced this problem. Today I took my first mission to Clon**** with my new RK-1 char and guess what...I almost threw my comp out the window. MOBs that aggro pop up in attack range. I had 100% View distance and 80m char view.

Please Enno fix this! There's a difference in the server code and I hope you fix it soon.

WGMelchior @ 1/9/2002 5:34:26 AM (6587):
Eh, in what way would you think a GM could help you with this? Sure, if you char is bugged, or you items are bugged, then maybe. But they don't program the game, and if there is a bug with no workaround, what are they to do?

If an Advisor comes across a player that has a problem that a GM can solve, they will call for a GM that very moment. That only applies to some cases, like a lost appartment key, because you can't give volunteers all the commands.

He/she should have been nicer. You kind of expect that. But everyone has their bad days, and I don't like all the people I meet. I guess he just wanted to do what he could, which wasn't much, and then move on to players he could help.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/9/2002 5:57:00 AM (6407):
This is an EXTREMELY annoying bug/design flaw.  I've died way too many times during a fight I thought I was going to win easily simply because I couldn't register that last hit that was needed to kill the MOB.

Baroque @ 1/9/2002 10:22:46 AM (6492):
I think the reason the level and agressive tools work is because they have a target concealment level listed in the requirements.  The life and nano point tool only has the perception requirement for you to use it and does not have a target concealment level.

I tried a QL 40ish life and nano tool on my fixer and it would work on level 1 mobs but would not work against a level 5 lizard.

Some even manage building weapons and nanos.

Ellusion @ 1/9/2002 3:55:57 PM (5801):
The explanation is simple, but not readily so in your first post.

Playing a mission alone will leave you with quite normal mob behaviour, 1on1's with the occasional add from the close rooms -  on sight only.

The problem presents iteself when you bring along a friend or more in these missions. Not knowing the exact game mechanics, I can say for certainty that every additional player in a mission will seriously enhance mob aggro levels. 2 players doing a mission will more often than not pull in additional mobs from adjecent rooms, wether they can see any of you or not. This is quite easy to test - go to a starting hall by yourself and you're guaranteed to get only the 3 mob aggro (unless anyone else sees you), and then try this with a friend - expect 2-3 adds right away from the nearby rooms.

At first I believed this to be proffesion spesific (ie, what's wrong with that bloody NT? He aggroes everything! =), but it quickly turned out to be the same scenario whatever companion I brought along for the tougher missions.

It is possible to control the aggro though, just takes a lot more planning, pulling from up to 2-3 rooms away. Wether it's a bug can be argued over though; bringing a friend to help out should make things a little harder as mobs will be more suspect to notice all your noise. Of course, that is a balance issue, and we know how good FC is at nailing those right on the head =)

It was my understanding that only the Nadir version was designed by a rebel, Nadir Antagonist.   I suppose this was the reason the rebel symbol is present on the helment.  Due to limitations in the implementation of the game, all variants of steel ribbed have to have the rebel symbol on the helmet.  But, I don't see how that makes it "clan armor".

If it was called something like "Knights Steel Ribbed" or "Eco Warrior Steel Ribbed" you would have a point.  But there is no reference to a rebel orginization in the name of the armor, just the designer of the armor.

If is "rebel armor", then why has it always been for sale in Omni shops?

In normal (non morphed) form this was erradicated some time ago.

P.S. I was in Lord of the Rings yesterday - this was real fun, almost had forgotten. I am playing this game way to much.

MatronVima @ 1/10/2002 10:56:59 AM (6587):
I have noticed that the ark'/gm' are good for venting
your frustration. Just dont overdo it and be civil about it.

Hehe.

As to actual help, well I was in a mission once. The zone
was being 'restarted' due to a stuck char. Not me thou
so only messing up my gametime, but hey they was doing 
something.

There is also a rumour I have heard that GM's are good
at changing your name, might well be that you have to
have a good and valid reason thou.

And oh yes, nearly forgot. I got a apartment key reset once.

So, they can help. Just ask for the things they can help with

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 12:15:39 PM (4871):
I've got an update on the broken weapon kits situation (and it's been a long time coming, sorry for that).

Weapon construction kits are being fixed (yes Darkherald, that includes SMG kits  ) and it's hoped they are patched in as soon as possible. You'll be able to be the arms dealer you've always wanted to be.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 12:37:22 PM (6036):
Thanks for the information, all of you. I'll make sure QA gets this information. Also please make sure you bug report this if you come across it again, as it really helps pinpoint the bug and the cause of it.

Thanks.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 12:40:08 PM (6651):
I've passed this along to be looked at. Thanks for the information. As always, please make sure you bug report this as well. Thanks again.

Finally, none of the Omni-Med Suit clothing has an Omni requirement.  However, the Omni-Med Cloak is Omni only.

Is the lack of an Omni only requirement on the Omni-Med suit an oversight? 
			
		
	
The Omni-Med suit pieces are being fixed and will do what they say they should do. They will be fixed very soon.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 1:01:49 PM (6187):
Charles, I'm really sorry to hear about the loss of your Bureaucrat suit. Although I can't bring the suit back for you, I'll make sure this is brought to the attention of others so it can be looked into and addressed. 

If you have not yet, I would appreciate it if you could also bug report this, so we get the information needed from you in the proper places so this can be fixed and so, most importantly, it won't occur again.

Thanks for your time, and again sorry about the item disappearance. I look forward to seeing you in a nice suit once again soon.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 1:14:29 PM (5801):
A few issues here, I know. I've passed this thread onto PQA so its definately been looked into. Please do make sure you send in a bug report about this too, as the more information we get, the faster this gets fixed. And that's what we want, I'm sure.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 1:21:41 PM (6446):
This bug is known and it's being fixed ASAP. That's about all the information I can give at the moment, but is there much else you want to hear? It's being fixed! 

However, please do, each time you come across this, bug report it and petition it. It is important that we get all the information we can so its ensured this is fixed and stays fixed. Thanks.

Cosmik @ 1/10/2002 1:38:32 PM (5673):
Thanks for the information listed here(how to recreate, what playfields it's happened in, etc). I'll be giving this thread to PQA to ensure its addressed and to give the information you've stated here. 

As I must always say (and I'm sorry for repeating myself), pelase make sure you bug report this as well if you haven't already done so. Posting it here for me to read is good, but placing all the good information so it goes right to PQA is even better. It makes things get fixed faster. 

Thanks everyone.

Naosuko @ 1/10/2002 3:17:49 PM (4871):
I have been doing a large amount of tradeskill research, and in fact I've sold off my weapons and armor, because my guild is giving me all of the bits they find fast enough to support me 

As far as I can tell, anything involving the following doesn't work:

-a co-weapon interface, except the OT Basic Weaponskills recipe
-a SMG kit

Also, I've tested and found these specific recipes to be broken:

1 - 20        ANEX - Mathis Multi-Energy Rifle
1 - 20        Dull Notum Staff
1 - 23        Second-Hand Triple-Blade
1 - 23        Useless Triple-Blade
1 - 30        Cheap Fiddle Rifle
1 - 40        Cheap Amytlo Executioner
21 - 40        Cast-Off Blackened Blaster
21 - 40        Cast-Off Right Slice

More to come as I continue testing.

starknaked @ 1/10/2002 3:18:43 PM (5879):
Cosmik, does this mean that the Omnimed clothing will be Omni only?

This would be an extreme nerf on all Clan players if this were done.  The clothing combined adds 64 to Treatment, at the moment, which allows the average player to equip a certain level of implants 16 levels earlier than he could have otherwise.

It's even more extreme than that, due to the skill caps at some levels.  I could probably manage to equip level 200 implants by the time I was level 120, using all possible treatment buffs, omnimed armor, and lower level treatment implants.

Without the Omnimed armor, I might not be able to do it until level 150 due to the skill cap at level 125.

And I can guarantee you that virtually all clan players who are interested in maxxing out their equipment would switch temporarily to Omni just to get their implants in place.

Which would be a ridiculous system to put in place.

starknaked @ 1/10/2002 3:26:29 PM (Bug - unable to attack at times 6738):
When I am the puller, and shoot a mob, and then it runs off the opposite direction from me due to bad pathing (happens often), at times when it comes back into range I will be totally unable to attack it.

It will be shooting at me and hitting me, but my autoattack won't engage, nor will I be able to attack back.

So I have to wait around for everyone else to kill it, assuming I'm in a team.

starknaked @ 1/10/2002 3:36:22 PM (6079):
Funcom won't likely answer you, but here is your answer:

The problem, totally unacknowledged by Funcom, is that most zones in the game are separated up into little minizones which are 40 meters across.

You can see everything in the minizone you're in, plus in all the adjacent minizones, giving you a view range of 40-80 meters, depending on which direction you're facing and where you're standing within your minizone.

However, in some zones, such as 2holes, these minizones are much smaller, perhaps only 20 meters across instead of 40.

This means that depending on where you are in your little minizone and where the mobs are, they can suddenly appear 20 meters away from you as you're walking along, and then instantly attack you.

When this game was first designed and when it first went live, you were able to see everything which was 2 minizones away, instead of just one, which gave you a long view distance, and even in these zones with smaller minizones you didn't have a problem.

But the game's engine choked and sputtered under the weight of having to keep track of everything within 120 meters of you, and in crowded areas people were getting tiny frame rates and constantly grinding hard drives, and so this was fixed by only letting you see what is in the minizones right next to yours.

And so now, in certain zones in the game, you can't see anything that's more than 20-40 meters away from you.

One day, Funcom will eventually admit that this is a problem.  As of now, they're still pretending that view range is 40-80 meters everywhere in the game.

Dhurdahl @ 1/10/2002 3:56:44 PM (5879):
Yes it would be bad but acording to the desc of the item...

But I don't think we'll see that right now. My personal idea about this is that the Omni-Med stuff should have a "Department: Omni-Med" req on it. But this requires that FC enables those in the game.

FireC @ 1/10/2002 4:59:04 PM (6738):
This has been happening me a lot over the past couple of days, and I've seen it happen to some others as well. Luckily it usually fixes itself in a bit and you don't have to relog but it really isn't too nice thing to have happen to you when you're fighting higher level mobs and every bit of damage you do matters a lot.

FireC @ 1/10/2002 5:04:35 PM (5673):
Yes, I've had this happen as well, and this has been around as long as I can remember... meaning since the beginning of soon after. I get it only (i think) in missions, and usually it's in that cave room with four doors and some pillars in the middle - if there's a mob in that room I'm usually dead in a moment. Only thing I've found to help is to move around till the camera suddenly goes back to normal.

Razaak @ 1/10/2002 6:01:18 PM (Team Grid Phreak gridding more than your team? 6759):
Last night up in the Avalon borg area, my wife and I plus 4 others were fighting.  She and I decide to leave and ask everyone to leave the team.  They do, and I cast team grid phreak.  The result: everyone who IS and WAS on my team was put into the grid too.  All were confused, and one was thankful, since he was about to die.  Seems like a classic case of a doubly linked list being unlinked in one direction but not the other...

This is the first time I've seen this.  I bet zoning would clear the list.  The other guys had joined teams already, so that clearly didn't do it either.  Perhaps if my wife and I re-formed our team, it would clear the list as well.

Gogliostro @ 1/10/2002 6:46:42 PM (5673):
This has happened to me 2-3 times when I ran from the Newland grid towards the water. The camera zoomed out, and when I zoomed in again, I was in an empty Newland zone at the coords: 0.1, 0.1.

I had to find a zone border to get out of the empty Newland zone.. and then zone back in again.

If you morph or wear a cloaking device, etc. then when you return to "normal" your clothing reverts to using the base textures.

Subject IV @ 1/10/2002 7:40:59 PM (4871):
Thank you so much for the update Cosmik. I have wanted to be a weapons dealer from the first day I even read about AO.

Now we just need to be able to make ALL weapons, like the popular Nova Flow and Vecktor ND shotguns so that people will buy our wares.

I really do enjoy spending the 1 hour it takes to make a weapon. I just would like that hour to be somewhat profitable. Player-made items should always at least compete (if not exceed) store bought ones.

Make that content addition, and Funcom will truly be on the right track to making this the best mmorpg on the market.

Scorus @ 1/10/2002 9:10:06 PM (Misaligned Zone Bug 6776):
You guys have done a really good job at fixing the more problematic misaligned zones lately. Here is one I just found today:

I was at 199.5, 2523.5 in the NW corner of Aegean. I headed West into Athen Shire and appeared at 2838.4, 2134.3 in Athen Shire. So far so good.

I then backed up (i.e. went East) to get back into Aegean and found myself at 531, 1118 in Aegean. This is at Rising Sun next to the Wartorn Valley zone border.

I duplicated the run just to make sure I wasn't crazy and to get the coords.

Unfortunately this zoning was made necessary from that really aggravating 'can't use items until you zone' bug that triggers when you are running from a creature. Later this afternoon that bug got me killed in Upper Stret East Bank when I wasn't near anywhere I could zone into to heal between close encounters. Are you working on that bug? I haven't seen any reactions to any of the posts about it.

Scorus

Cado @ 1/10/2002 9:44:57 PM (5571):
Whoa - I want one of those !

Does that mean that we might soon get a table for our apartment soon ?

Honestly, the apartment in AO needs to be fixed soon. Not being able to put more than 10 items into them is real bad ... not to mention I have yet to find a table / chair / bed !

cooljoe345 @ 1/10/2002 9:46:58 PM (4871):
Ouch my friend still can't make it too

Cado @ 1/10/2002 10:03:07 PM (943):
I don't see the apartments mentioned in the bug list - Have it been forgotten again ?

Yes, there are people thatw ant to have more than 10 items in their apartment !

Yes, we want real furnitures in there too !
(like chairs / tables / beds, not just paintings and lamps)

Dr.Loc[ation] @ 1/10/2002 11:25:47 PM (Some stuff i will share with you all ;oP 6785):
Im a doc, i heal ppl. i raise my nanoC init  so i can heal faster. This should be correct and the way its supposed to be, init raises the speed of the nano.....

Then: Why isnt the recharge affected by the NanoC init? 
It  is so slow.....

I took my init down to -1200 ( with a  debuff ), and the recharge was still the same speed....

That means that i can`t trow my heals any (noticeable) fast because of the recharge, mobs do dmg much faster than i can heal....

Is is supposed to be like this?

(( and plz, Cant somebody fix the aggro. i get aggroed just  by being near. I get aggroed even if i dont heal or attack, even if my agg-def bar is full def.... its just non sense... ( ok, it makes some sense because a "smart" human would kill the healer first, so the rest would be easier, but those OTs arent smart ( haha ), or even mobs. is maybe failed experiments (blahblahblah) smart.... or whatever mob? This just troubles me.......)

Meskulan @ 1/11/2002 1:02:46 AM (I found a minor bug! (short and sweet for you lazy readers) 6794):

Yes.. I've encountered this bug as well. Cosmik! Take a look!

Pluteaux @ 1/11/2002 2:58:15 AM (6036):
I mentioned in my previous post that this happened several times to me. I believe each time I was fighting far from the mission entrance, was losing, outran the mob to the mission entrance and waited for the mob to arrive, killed him, and sat down. Hope this helps in debugging.

ishtan @ 1/11/2002 3:49:48 AM (6036):
This bug is not related in anyway to what playfield you are in.This happens in missions and outdoor playfields.

This bug is not related to multiple enemies.It happens 1 on 1 or with multiple MOBs.

This bug is NOT HP related.It happens at low HP and at Full HP.

This bug is NOT related to a particular MOB/NPC.It happens with any MOB/NPC.

In my xperience of this bug it is NOT predictable and therefore a very dangerous bug.You cant change your game play around it because it could happen at the end of any given fight.

This bug makes close fights an absolute horror.I dont find many fights to be all that easy hehe...who wants to kill greys and greens all day?

LRRH @ 1/11/2002 4:30:52 AM (6785):
Recharge time for nano programs is your nanomites gaining their energy back and the like. There is no skill (to my knowledge) that changes this. -However-, I'm fairly certain there's a deck addon (like the Coolant Sink, but different) that lowers recharge time. Maybe. Don't quote me on that. ;p

Noe @ 1/11/2002 4:41:39 AM (6651):
Same thing happens to my Waitt helmet after I get out of my car.  As soon as I zone or whompa, any area change basically and its back to normal.

This also occurs as a side bug w/ Reet Form, after zoning, sometimes you will be a reet that looks like it has your head half swallowed.

Might be something similar in the bug's mechanics.

Misophist @ 1/11/2002 4:53:48 AM (6651):
... but I've seen Mid cars with helmet heads, reets with helmet heads, leets with helmet heads. Watching two Mids with helmet heads hanging down from them was by far the funniest thing I've seen in AO for quite some time.

Also, my MA's fugly pinky Flowers helm turns into blah brown regular tech after I get out of my plane.

Daeem @ 1/11/2002 6:02:36 AM (6072):
Maybe... but of course i've seen it the other way arround once

You attack an obscene ammount of times in a span of .0002 seconds.

This only happened once and only because for some odd reason i had hit lag on a dsl line.  Mobs hitting often is usually because the client isn't updated with the damage properly every time it's dealt to you.  Of course this is nothing compared to the Parrygun which every npc on the planet has and nobody else does.

Daeem @ 1/11/2002 6:12:09 AM (5864):
Ive recently found that half my items love to scramble in my backpacks.  Now even digging thru the rubble sometimes i have a hard time finding that hidden treatment kit.

This has basically been in effect since day 1.

Daeem @ 1/11/2002 6:22:52 AM (5447):
Gone from 100 to 800... suffice it to say that this has been reported.  Too bad though... the 800 run speed was like using a Yalmaha, after all i've seen how fast those go.  This also worked with npc run speed debuff stackage.

Daeem @ 1/11/2002 6:34:34 AM (4017):

starknaked @ 1/11/2002 8:43:33 AM (Longest Road dungeon bugged like hell 6830):
I made it to the end of the longest road dungeon, was in a cave at the end, when suddenly I was attacked by 2 mobs that weren't there.

Despite the fact that I had my run speed jacked up to 780, I was unable to run away from these invisible mobs which didn't show up on the map, they continued to attack me no matter where I ran, and I never was able to attack back, until I was dead.

While some may consider this to be an exciting new feature, getting killed by things which aren't there without any way of escaping from them, I am not in favor of this feature, and would suggest that it be removed.

Kagoth @ 1/11/2002 10:29:29 AM (3234):
Before christmas vacation, I was dedicated to raising enough money to get a yalmaha; even tho my highest playable char was a lvl 51 Engineer. 

How I got the money: So, I used the knowledge that I gained to take advantage of the system. I downloaded a Mission terminal viewer type program, that showed me the item and reward, and I started clicking away. It was wonderful to find the perfect mission fast, and it was much more efficient. I knew that decus coats were rare, so I took a bunch of missions with them in it. I was used to searching without the mission viewer, so I know how hard it is usually. I get about 5 decuses, and start selling them, and I see some being auctioned for 400k! So I go on full alert for decus selling, and getting.
A couple of days later I decide to not do missions anymore, and just do full time trading of decus coats. I bought ql 50 coats for about 150k, and sold them for about 300k. I thought it would be a great business, and in many ways it was.
A week later, and I have 16 decus coats. Ql 40-100, tertius, secundus, and primus. I sell the primus for e-bay prices . By this time, the market has seemed to die down ALOT, and I can barely sell 3 coats in a whole day of posting. I was buying alot more than I was selling. So, I did battle suit missions with friends and so forth.

Buying the plane: I walked into a shop, on a last ditch effort to find a ql 30 plane. It seemed that the higher ql planes only gave a meager speed increase, and I was after the speed multiplication . So I see it for 5mil. I only have 4.65mil. I start asking friends for help, and get kinda restless. I check my abundant inventory of backpacks galore. I remember some battle suits. I had 2 ql 110 battle suits, and 2 ql 110 plasteel battle suits. I sold them, even tho I thought they were cool. I got the plane 

I have a plane!: It is glorious. After playing 30 days in AO total, I fell kinda weird being able to move so freely. I am especially excited, because at lvl 71, my engineer has gotten a team member warp nano, that he has used to move whole teams to ql 100 missions . Now I look forward to warping people odd places.

I loose the plane: I went to my favorite booth in tir, It's in the NW corner. I get outa my plane to log to do the mission view thing. When I log back on, I get 2 missions with battle suits in them, then log off again. When I log back on to do the missions, I immediately look for the yalm. It should be in my inventory. It's nowhere. I get worried and petition. I stay in one spot because I don't wanna screw anything up more.

Ark keeps me hanging: So, I ask him if I might get my plane back, and he trys to keep from giving any definitive answer. Then I ask him if anybody in my situation has gotten their plane back. He avoids the answer it seemed at first. He then said that people have gotten their plane back in my situation, but he tries to keep my expectations neither high nor low. 

It is now 1am, January 11th. I lost my plane a couple of hours ago. If somebody read my post here, please post a reply saying so. It is alot of words

si @ 1/11/2002 11:37:45 AM (Attacked by -NONE-. Me or the MOB ? 6843):
I'm getting this pain in the backside bug that I thought I'd just dump here in the vain hope someone will read it.

If I'm in the middle of a tough mission, and I come up against an orange or red (It's getting to be yellows now too) then I like to hit them with brawl first off to get their attention and run all the way back to the mission entrance in case I need to zone (Having to do this more and more often btw).

Sometimes by the time I get back to the first 'grace' room I turn around and eventually the mob enters the room as well. I press Q or B (As brawl has sometimes refreshed by this point) but all I get is 'wait for previous attack to finish' or something. No matter what I try to do I cannot attack this mob but he is busily taking chunks out of me. If I zone then it's okay again as you'd expect.

I think it only happens when after it says 'Attaked by [MOB name]', I run and it eventually says 'Attacked by -NONE-'. If it does this it seems more likey I cant attack when the mob catches me up.

This may well have been reported but with a billion bugs already I can't be bothered searching to find out.

Maximilian @ 1/11/2002 12:07:38 PM (6830):
Stark, this bug is not exclusive to this (Longest Road static) mission area. I had this (several times) happening to me and others (team) while on 'normal' missions. Out of the nothing (through walls and whatsoever) you get attacked by an invisible opponent. Sometimes you are happy to win the fight, but one usually is not able to detect or even determine it.
I assume a server sync problem. The server knows, they are there, but the client (you) are not informed (wild guess).

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.S. I hope, you made it.

Weight of the guilty, getting debuffed in missions...

I'd never had it happen to me till yesterday, I was debuffed left and right from mobs in a mission (also had weight of the guilty cast on me too at times) and I ended up with a run speed of 2134.  Minor bug because it goes back to normal when you zone, but man was I fast!  It was pretty amusing to my doc friend since I kept running into walls.  It was kinda hard to control my direction since I moved so quickly.

MaDezzie @ 1/11/2002 2:49:38 PM (5879):
If they made Omni-Med clothing, omni only, then I'm sure FC would implement some kind of general medical wear as well.  A 64 point advantage to omni is completely unfair to clanners and neuts, and it would cause an uproar on these boards if FC was stupid enough to make such a change without implementing an equal item(s) for other affiliations.

Scorus @ 1/11/2002 2:58:03 PM (6870):
It is a bug, it was first reported in beta, it has never been addressed.

Some people also think Life implants don't work because they don't get a bonus from them when they first put them in also. They do work, the health is adjusted upward when you zone.

nanokat @ 1/11/2002 5:10:42 PM (6474):
Wow,

I am really suprised more people are not griping about this bug.  If your in a group situations and you wield a slow weapon every group heal cast on you has a good chance of nullifying your attack.  The lost damage output is pretty significant.  You can actually wield a weapon like a Stiener and do zero damage as each attack is nullified.  Even a very fast weapon can be interrupted, just not as easily!

Turn on your damage messages people and watch your attack bar.  See how many attacks are not being executed!

Cloudeh @ 1/11/2002 5:11:37 PM (Cant make new char cuz.. 6881):
It simple wont let me choose any DAMN NAME!
I have tried EVERYTHING.
Ive looked in books for names, magazines, I have tired all the ff7 names, everything, ff8 ones, the monster, Gf's.

I dotn want a name I dont like, I have tired variants, 1337 text names, putting e's to 3's.

nothing, WTF?! FC suck me.

Barakon @ 1/11/2002 5:29:27 PM (6072):
If its lag, how come my damage done to the mob doesn't suddenly spam me when the lag clears? Also this is a recent occurence, i've always had lag yet this is fairly new as far as I can see..



You hit mob
mob hit you
you hit mob
mob hit you
you hit mob
mob zapped you with DD
mob hit you
mob hit you
you hit mob

thats what its like...

Barakon @ 1/11/2002 5:34:30 PM (6759):
Yep, i've been the pleasantly surprised recipient of team heals from a team I recently left(before zoning).

MORB @ 1/11/2002 5:44:53 PM (6881):
No offense, but if you are picking names from final fantasy games, you're asking for troubles... Try to be a little bit more imaginative.

You can get names from a lot of games, movies, books, or even make up a name that just sound goods but have no particular meaning (that's what I do).

Just avoid the few most populars things, like final fantasy, matrix, lord of the rings, star wars and the likes, and you'll find something...

MORB @ 1/11/2002 6:05:15 PM (The uber fast hitting mobs bug 6885):
It has been reported a while ago on the board, with human NPCs. I have experienced it a few times since, and  again yesterday, with monsters this time.

Level 57 mission at clon****, filled with boulder blubbags and moniliths blubbags.

I was with a friend, and we started to do the mission. The monolith blubbags are light greens and the boulders are deep green for me, so no problem.... Until my teammate accidentally got aggroed by a monolith blubbag through a door while I was looting a chest. He's only level 46, so I went on to help him. I attacked it, but since I wasn't fully healed from the previous fight, we had to run away and zone. My friend got lost and then killed, and logged off.

I proceeded to complete the mission. I was killing every blubaggs easily, until I stumbled again on the particular blubbag that killed my friend. I go with full health, full nanos, and attack it.

It was hitting me so fast that I could barely take off one 10th of his lifebar before I had to chainheal and then start to run for the exit...

While I was hitting other blubbags about four times for each of their hits, this one was hitting me about two times for every time I hit.

I completed the mission, tried to attack this blubbag again, same thing.

I had the same problem with human NPCs, where I was getting aggroed, zoned out, and then when going back in the mission, they would hit me so fast that I would knock off less than a quarter of their life before needing to get the hell out, although on the first encounter I took out one half of their health before I had to zone...

Zaal @ 1/11/2002 7:25:52 PM (6881):
No kidding.  This isn't a bug...  you're just picking stuff that people before you beat you to.

You need to be a little more original.   

I have personally seen the following variations on names.

John
Jon
Jahn
Jyohn
John1
Johnny5
Jonny5

etc.  

It would only take one letter difference to let u choose a name.  Don't be so rigid.  And I can't count the number of times I've tried to /tell a friend and mispelled their name only to have that /tell go to someone completely different.

Laeni @ 1/11/2002 7:47:23 PM (6881):
I commonly make a spelling variation when a name I chose has already been taken. I wanted Lani, game wouldn't let me have it so I changed it to Laeni and voila!

Just be a little more imaginative in how you spell it.

zeroframerate @ 1/11/2002 9:01:22 PM (6885):
I've experienced the same things with random mobs sometimes.

I fought a Hammer Broodling one time and the thing was smacking me seven times a second, like it was insane and on speed.  I managed to kill it, but there was no way it should have been conning as green.

FireC @ 1/11/2002 10:10:11 PM (6881):
Try something original and you won't have any trouble *grin*. Granted I've had most of my names for months of from the beginning, but none of them are "normal" names or from any popular book or a game. Take a look at some web sites that list names, normal human names, there's plenty of those and you wouldn't believe what kind of things you can find.

Psyberfox @ 1/12/2002 12:33:02 AM (6407):
I thought the MOB was just going full def on the agg/def bar because it seems they shoot/hit slower also.

=(, oh well ... to hell with it..

starknaked @ 1/12/2002 2:56:19 AM (Ruse of Taren 2 bugged 6940):
Will this be fixed in the next patch?

When using Ruse of Taren, after zoning, you shrink down to tiny size and your run speed is cut in half, or even less than half.

This, once again, makes False Professions unusable, because if you're under a false profession you can't recast Ruse of Taren.

Situation: Attack a seeming alone mob at about 35m. Mob does nothing for a couple of seconds. Then he and 4 of his buddies "appear" out of nowhere right next to you, all of them attacking.

Look I'm a Fixer. My main assest is the hit and run attack, which is totally negated by a teleporting mob. Please fix this.

your talking about the save point in Wilky forest near Newland city? I get the impression your supposed to appear at that other reclaim spot. For people fighting near the save point it wud be far too easy as theres spawns all round it.

JFlack @ 1/12/2002 9:56:27 PM (6474):
Last night I was helping out a lower level group by tanking.  Being an Adv lvl 36, I've got an ok heal program, but during the fight this other player's low level team heal kept interrupting my high level self heal.  I nearly died because of it.  Things were happening so fast, I didn't figure out what was happening until after the combat was over.

People really need to be made aware of this!

mgbkurtz @ 1/12/2002 10:07:10 PM (6794):
yeah, i couldn't find the reclaim terminal after dying at the oasis.  took a couple minutes, but frustrating at the least

Scorus @ 1/13/2002 1:32:00 AM (6870):
If you place an inner energy implant in, then it will raise your NanoPool stat but will NOT give you any more nano in your pool. You can zone as many times as you want, you will still not find any extra nano pool. I tested this personally after 13.5 and it is still not fixed.

I have never tried an inner pool implant, they might be fine.

when are you going to make us soldiers able to switch weapons while we are in MK, its REALLY anoying! please! this is just one of many soldier bugs that have been around since launch. its time for soldiers to get some lovin!

p.s Now that healing is so uber in pvp, please either give sols a new line of healing nanos OR give us MK back! we dont stand a chance against ANY of the classes that can heal in one way or another!

Doctorkain @ 1/13/2002 5:24:05 AM (6885):
Oh yeah, I've got cute little screenshots of a monster hitting me twice in between my attacks - considering I was using fists and a sword, my attacks were 1.0 seconds apart, and he was hitting me twice in that 1.0 second period.

Lag catch up?

Nope, because he did it for the attack before too. And the attack before as well.

Normally, a mob swing animates twice, it means he's rolled for a hit once. I punch twice in a single attck cycle - and will only hit ONE of those punches. It's just the stupid way everything's animated.

He swings once. My damage sheild reflected ONCE. He hit TWICE. Then he does the second swing of that two-swing set for each hit a mob does - hits me again, TWICE, both spitting to my console at the same time. Two swings, four hits, one reflect damage, none of the animated swings miss EVER. Each time he swipes, I take two hits.

Considering that's 4x hit rate, that will kill you very very quickly. Happened to me very very often. I'd get completely and utterly owned by some weak mob because it was hitting me 20 times a second. Doesn't matter any more I guess though.

Doctorkain @ 1/13/2002 5:33:48 AM (6036):
This bug has happened to me... it happened to me so many times it's not amusing, and in no way at all is it rare. So you know, it won't always say 'Starting attack failed' - I've spontaneously died with no damage and aggro message. Took nice screenies of it too that show the entire console. No aggro, no damage, no damage reflected from my bracers, no 'Starting attack failed', just

Here's an update:

Orderangelxx @ 1/13/2002 4:04:41 PM (3234):
all i can say to this is. HOW DID I POSSIBLY LOSE THE PLANE TO BEGIN WITH????

oh let me guess, i'm an exploiter. Man **** this. I'm so tired of this ****. I'm taking my guild to another game. I'm so tired of this god damned beta. Hell everyone check out this game www.ro-world.com (Ragnorak Online) its in beta and its FREE.

To everyone, i must be an exploiter, a complete idiot for deleting my plane, or i simply never bought one for 4.9 million credits. MAN I'M SO ANGRY. After all my real life friends quit, i convince all my friends from games like Ultima Online and EverQuest to come here. Hell I even turn one of my friends from Squaresoft to this game to try it out.

Greatest thing is I'm writing a review for a German Magazine. I'm recording every good and bad event and now this just scored one for the bad side.

Orderangelxx @ 1/13/2002 4:06:51 PM (3234):
From complete love, to complete distrust and hate. God I had my hopes SO DAMN high up for this game. Sorry for multiple posts... I just can't contemplate doing like 90 boring ass missions to buy another plane so I can stop casting quantum wings over and over.

Zaal @ 1/13/2002 7:23:33 PM (3234):
I took screenshots of me buying the plane.  

Even more so though - while I was in missions getting stuff to sell to get the plane I lost my car, and it was returned to me by a GM.  I don't know how their system works for tracking these expensive baubles but if I ever lost the plane that I payed 5.2 million for I would be severely put out too.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/14/2002 12:18:27 AM (6843):
I always zone to clear the bug.  That's really annoying, since zoning always gives the MOB time to heal, and there's a chance it's one of thoe unbeatable MOBs that stands by the entrance for the next half hour-hour.  If so, it means you can't do that mission anymore until the MOB goes away, because it always aggros the moment you zone in.

NightShade @ 1/14/2002 3:51:09 AM (Mission Completion...Bug? 7104):
I recieved a mission on 100% good, 100% chaos, a mission that is typically a "go find this construction manual, it can help us defeat the enemy" mission.  I guess you're supposed to go get the manual in question and then return it to the terminal.  (I've never accepted one of these before.)  The thing that was different about this mission (besides that I actually wanted the reward  ) was that it said "superior nanoclusters" instead of whatever obscure construction manual that it normally says.  Well, while I was in mission, I found a SHOP selling superior nanoclusters ranging from around the 70's to the 170+.  I stood there a while with it selected, opened the machine a couple of times, etc.  Nothing happened, and I knew that I couldn't pick the machine up and put it in my inventory (I actually tried, to be certain), so I decided to buy a cheap object in the machine and bring it back to the mission terminal that I got the mission from.  Well, I did, and nothing happened.  Is this a bug, am I just a friggin retard, have any of you had this happen to you?

NightShade @ 1/14/2002 3:53:53 AM (6462):
Yeah, I've had missions like that (but only when I was on a lower level).  At least they're easy missions  .

Jorji- @ 1/14/2002 7:35:13 AM (Steps of Madness 7117):
Im not sure if this is technically a bug or a gameplay thing..perhaps a little of both..

Well im a lvl 65 Fixer, teamed with a very good friend lvl 75 MP

We arrive at SoM for a laugh and to finally complete the dungeon (we have been dying here since lvl 30)

We buff, have a few laughs, zone in and boom 'grid camped' by 11 mobs (i guess another team had been in there and run the place)

turn zone and die...

now if this had happened once id have a lill laugh and say 'oh well thats how it goes'...but after this happening to me twice and my friend 3 times it becomes more than annoying..


add to it the fact that trade crashed 3 times in 5 min before we got to steps....

and then i pettition just to see what is possible (can the dungeon be reset so we dont get ganked? can we have 10 second on zoning in before we get hit so we can exit when there is that much agro in one room)...game freezes

reboot comp as its locked up the whole computer...reload AO 
oops ive crashed again..whole computer lockup...reboot and give up

all i wanted was an hour of fun with my friend...

PS if this doesnt belong in this area please move me

Ashuras @ 1/14/2002 9:15:38 AM (7117):
Get a soldier with good MK shield. Ask him to go in 1st with shields on. Then u guys zone in.

Should help u survive the 1st few seconds

Hextorr @ 1/14/2002 10:17:53 AM (Team split going into Static Dungeon (that alst one...in Longest Road) 7129):
We organised a Guild event, we ere quite a few, adn we all went inot the dungeon, the majority of the guild went into one dungeon and some 5 of us end up in another "mirror" dungeon... my team was made up of five, me and another team member were in one dungeon with 3 more guild mates from other teams and the rest of my team (3 more) were in the other dungeon with the rest of the guilg.

I had heard that you are supposed to always end up in the same dungeon has your team... if this isn't the case you have to change it, cause it really killed all the fun of a night out at the dungeon ((((((((

Hextorr @ 1/14/2002 10:32:16 AM (Combat bugs 1) in pvp; 2) fighting monsters 7131):
Bug number 1 - pvp
I initiate a fight everything goes well, i move out of range and back in...while running around the target comes back up on the top left corner of my window, but now i cannot attack, i can still use spetials but i dont even see an anomation, my character stans as if idle, and i can still be hit back, if the other palayer has a damage shield i am getting spammed for damage without beeing able to hit it (it's not a visual bug...i realy dont hit) it seems that after i zone i am ok, but with the visual range bug (when you lose view range just after a few meters, althou youa re using max view range in your settings) this happens a lot and realy hurts my pvp experience.
(this happened in at least 4 diferent ocasions/players over 2 diferent zones

bug number 2 - fighting monsters
It seems that for no reason i will suddenly only hit for minimal damage until i zone, it happens on monsters i would normaly hit for good damage, i think it happens after i use Full Auto, then i only hit for minimal damage until i zone.

This two bugs only start happening since i began using a Surpressor ql200 some days ago

Hextorr @ 1/14/2002 10:39:08 AM (Accumulated damage bug 7132):
this has been arround for some time now, it is hard to reproduce and i'm not entirely sure how it happens but it seems that when fighting you sometimes get bugged and you accomulate damage that doesn't get delivered, then when you attack a new player/monster you unleash all that damage i've had realy spetacular reuslts, when i initiated a combat with Burst and it spammed 7 normal hits and the burst, it happens once in a while.

It has also happen to me, while beeing hit by a monster (much more rare) he just spammed the hell out of me with damage, like 5 hits in a row extremely fast and i realy dont think it was lag related i didnt even fire on round, it was exacly has it happen to me when hitting players/monsters with that bug.

I realy don't know how it happens, cause it doesn't happen very often, but it seems it happens in between fights

Hextorr @ 1/14/2002 10:43:51 AM (6843):
yeah it happens to me a lot in pvp, only after i loose contact with the target for a moment and regain,  now that i;ve read yur post i think it also happens with mobs, but with a team you don't suffer so much and blame it on lag and juast say "damn, can't attack" on team chat :/

Chill @ 1/14/2002 12:24:18 PM (Monsters damage bug 7140):
Some monsters hit for a large amount of damage 1 hit out of 2 which is twice or more the damage of a mob of their level.

It always happens with :
- TAC mutants (runaway, public enemy, etc) : for example, 1 hit for 140 chemical dmg then 1 hit for 60 chemical dmg, rinse and repeat. The 140 dmg is not a crit because in this case it does 300 dmg. It is easy to notice it's a bug because when I wear a bracer which returns chemical dmg it only works on one of those attacks and does nothing for the other.
- A-xxxx soldier (xxxx = 1000 and +) : same thing as TACs but with energy energy damage.
- Hammer (broodling, breeder, bull) : same thing but with melee dmg.
- Lifebleeder (fatestealer, chaos minion) : same thing but with radiation dmg.

When the game was first released it never used to happen. I don't remember exactly which patch did it but it's already several months old.

Another noticeable dmg bug :
The rate of attacks of certain mobs (lesser anun tearers especially) is insane and twice as fast as my maxed speed MA fists (which are 1.0 attack and recharge delays).
Higher level anuns are much easier to kill because they hit normally (I have more trouble killing a grey lesser anun tearer than a red anun slasher). Sometimes those mobs go berserk and hit 4 times before I can hit once.

With all the information I gave above you can easily reproduce it and find out what I mean then fix the bugs.

Btw, I noticed you will fix the Mz-99 kalinkanov brawl bug I mentioned in next patch, I hope you will do the same with that

Cosmik @ 1/14/2002 12:28:13 PM (5879):
Well, as you've probably seen from the 13.6 patch notes, the Omni-Med suits will do exactly what they say they are meant to do (increasing both Treatment and First Aid certain amounts).

As for the other topic here in this thread, the Omni-Med suit is not meant to be used by Omni-Tek only. If a clanner can get his hands on one, he or she is free to use it. Omni-Med suits don't discriminate.

Hi, 
 
I'm very sorry about this but there ain't much we can do about it. Our	
policy it not to give back items before we get the loggin tools in  
order.	
 
I'm very sorry but if you buy such expencive equipment you should try  
logging out or zone 2-3 tims so you are sure the equipment saves itself. 
 
I can understand if this feels frustrating because good armour like  
that are very expencive and I will take it up with my buss in a couple	
of hours and tell him about this incident and others like it that has  
happend earlyer today and yesterday with newly bought equipment. One  
thing you could do is to message the guy you bought it from if he has  
it.

---------------------------------------

It wasn't a yalmaha, but a full set of ql100 flowers tech armor except 1 sleeve was ql100 primus. Just happened to be unfortunate enough to be rp'ing and switched to casual clothes. Needed some room in inventory so I could split blister packs and pills and hack them and pass them around. So I put all the armor in my backpack. Realize i'm going to need a ql100ish hacker tool for those pills, so I zone out of the rhomba bar, run to trade, pick me up some new tools, go back, hack some pills, move stuff around, put all the tools and pills into the bag with my armor and take the armor back out of the bag. Game crashes, I come back in, no more armor, but oooh, I have a duped hacker tool I can sell for 500 credits. I didn't buy the armor like whoever gave me that response thinks. I spent 6+ hours scanning and running missions to get it. Looks like I have to put on the previous armor I had that is now 3ql lower than my level and spend another 6+ hours running missions for a new set of armor to ungimp myself...yay. Tried petition...yah right, 10pm central usa time on a sunday night...feh. Was 15th in line for over an hour, obviously 24/7 support doesn't exist on rubi-ka 2.

Tium @ 1/14/2002 2:04:22 PM (Hanshi Primus Decus Armour Helmets 7150):
There seems to ba a major problem with these helmets.

I have 3 different ql's, 153,177 and a 200.

These helmets are based on Agility/Strength, and as the quality level of the helmet rises, the Agility requirement does also.

The problem is the Strength requirement, on the ql200 it requires 496 str, which is understandable.

But the same strength is also required for ALL the helmets, thats 496 strength for a QL153!!!!

It took me a long time to get a full set of 177 primus and the helmet was the last piece that i got, so you can imagine how sick that made me feel when i shift clicked to take a closer look.

If i had a carrier craft this wouldnt be so much of a problem, but after camping the car shops for a few days it seems that they arnt in game any more, (can someone confirm this??)

Please update the database!

Thanks

Chill @ 1/14/2002 2:19:23 PM (7150):

By "asking for trouble", I just meant that FF is so popular among gamers that you can be sure that every single name related to it is certainly already taken :)

I think that you can forget also about any name from well known fantasy and sci-fi books and movies.

That's exactly why you have to be original to find a name, the obvious ones are probably all already used by now...

All,

I know at least a few of you have run into a problem that keeps plaguing me. Sometimes when I have run away from something (in a mission or outdoors), I will lose the ability to use any items (including first aid kits, save terminals, or getting out of my car) until I zone. This has killed me several times and caused me to go WAY out of my way in order to zone several more (I'm a crat, we have to run away a lot).

Yesterday when it hit I noticed that hidden behind my hotkey bar, my attack bar was stuck at full. I hit Q and suddenly everything was freed up! Needless to say, this was a major revelation and will save me a lot of headache until the bug itself is fixed.

Scorus

Lyriam @ 1/14/2002 3:57:41 PM ("find items" missions bug 7166):
It happened alot of times already, and since the arks take 2 hours to answer your call, i didnt ever stay in mission long enough to get "helped"

Yesterday again, it happened (but it allways occur under the same circumstances) I was nearly at the end of the mission, killing everything before picking the item up, to be sure i would get the token. On one of the last mobs, i crashed...You know one of those "error, you have been disconnected" crap messages, and no-way to re-enter the game because "character is already logged in". Well, anyway, logging back, back in the mission : no more item! I saw it, passed next to it during the missions, but didnt pick up to clear all rooms before. Well, here i am, for the 3rd time : no reward, no cash, no token, after walking for half an hour to get to mission area, and another hour to clear it..

Was in Belial the other day for a big war-event thing that didn't work out real well.

Made it into the clan-controlled outpost by flying in and zoning into a building unseen.
Waited a little bit to see if anyone else would make it... they didn't.
Got bored, so I decided to go out on a suicide run (there were probably 50 clanners outside this building, and I was all alone)

Found someone I could attack...
Dropped my long nuke (Feeble gravitational Anomaly)
Dropped my short nuke (Ol' Faithfull)
He was almost dead..... then someone healed him to full health

Saw about 50 people running at me... Knew I couldn't kill anyone, knew I was going to die (as I should have)
Then I thought... HEY! I'll just use this stupid-ass invulnerability after zoning timer.

Ran back into the building....
Went back outside... "You have 15 secs"
Jumped in my yalm
Left - "Later Suckers!"

That was sooooooo lame. I should have been dead. But, because of this timer, I left alive and unhurt, and laughing my ass off at how ridiculous this was. I would be so mad if I was the other guy.

peterrjg @ 1/14/2002 5:18:52 PM (MP Summoned Weapon Bugs 7178):
1. (Not a bug, but an annoyance) No expiry message on them. You lose track of time playing any game, especially AO. Since these weapons take forever to summon, a 3 or 5 minute expiry warning message would be good. 

2. Two occasions now I have permanently lost NCU memory from deck 3 logging in and out with my staff and buckler in hand. I've tried to reproduce it with just staff or buckler singly or by equipping another weapon, doesn't happen. Only with staff and buckler equipped. On the two occasions I've logged out with both equipped I have lost memory from deck 3. Sent a petition, wrote a bug report. Not going to try it again, as 32-64 memory isn't cheap to blow away for experimental purposes.
Staff is the Crotalus and buckler is Vital Buckler. 

3. Weapons stay in view on your character after expiry until you click on weapon inventory slots or zone; i,e, the world sees me wielding MP weapons, but my attack rating has dropped from 300 odd to the default 42 I have with my fists only. If I click on an expired weapon in my inventory it turns into a question mark no name icon and disappears.
If I zone, they disappear from inventory and world view.

4. (Not sure if this is a bug or by design) My attack rating is higher with just the Crotalus. If I equip the Vital Buckler as well, it drops. Not sure if this is a function of multi-melee or a bug. I don't expect it to go higher with both, but it going down doesn't seem to make sense.

Just a heads up.

siriuslea @ 1/14/2002 6:03:01 PM (Cloaking device and sneak 7183):
I'm aware it doesn't work with out sneaking but now it seems that with a cloaking device:

1) if you are wearing it and sneaking and get attacked you can't attack back (starting attack fails). 

2) Then of course you try and take it off and it wont come off

3)Here you get killed or sometimes if you end your attack (by pressing the battle key), you can take it off and fight

4) Graphical glitch where you are invisible after removing it

5)Even when not in battle, you cant toggle between sneak mode and regular walk without putting the device back on

Funcom please contact me in game on Rubi-ka 1 for more info if require.  Siriusleah.

In cave missions where there's a room with pillars blocking the middle, I'm too fat to fit between the pillars. Sometimes by jumping around I can make it.  Once I fit though fine but I think I might have been suffering the shrinking bug cause I seemed smaller.  

Also tried to get in a mission on the cave wall north of the war academy (Athenshire)and I couldn't get through the door.  I felt I was bouncing off the rocks around the door and couldn't get close enough to it to get in, like sometimes happens if you try and go through a door with you car enabled.

I made an Atrox Trader, named him Bigrigg. When I was picking a first and last name I noticed my profession title was "Chairman and CEO". I am not familiar with Traders so I didn't think anything of it at first. Only when I deleted Bigrigg and made him as a Solitus did I notice that the title is suppose to be Courier.

Something you might try - it worked well for us - is to get a volunteer to 'run the gauntlent'.  If the first room has gobs of mobs, then just run outta there, down the next hall and to the first room you find - it's a dead end room.  Of course, you'll bite it, but the mobs will stay in that room.  This tactic has worked for us every time.

this is very effective.... sometimes I think people camping neleb have one person pull all those mobs to the front, so that no one can come in and try to fight for the robe..... pretty crappy if you ask me.... they should be timed to return to their positions after a certain time with no fighting in main room

MaDezzie @ 1/14/2002 9:30:19 PM (7132):
I'm pretty sure this is related to lag.  Its happened to me before in teams.  I'll hit the hotkeys for burst/fling to start combat and I don't see anything happening, but I'm taking damage.  Then all of a sudden my damage is spammed in the chat along with my teammates' damage.

Barakon @ 1/14/2002 9:37:08 PM (7132):
The one where you suddenly do massive damage to the mob is display-only, as from my experience anyway, it will keep on fighting a while after its hp bar shows 0% health remaining.

Unfortunately when you take massive damage, in similar fashion, its usually followed shortly by that 'wet-thwacking' sound, quickly followed by your 'death-gasp'. fun huh?

Ampris @ 1/14/2002 10:45:19 PM (7182):
It is my understanding that is how that particular nano is supposed to work.

Agents can't use the new MP pet.

Ampris @ 1/14/2002 10:46:59 PM (7183):
Also, the DoT what is supposed to happen every 15 seconds doesn't work.  The DoT only happens once after it is worn and after zoning while the cloaking device is worn.

Smackyou @ 1/14/2002 11:27:51 PM (7183):
I put on the cloaking device and was attacked while cloaked. I tried to de-equip the cloaking device so I could attack back, but it would not let me remove it. Luckily I had a team to back me up. After the mob was dead, I was able to take the cloaking device off. Now when it is off, I cannot sneak. So basically my Aimed Shot cannot get off. I can only sneak when I put the cloaking device back on. I have zoned, but still makes no difference.

hobbes @ 1/15/2002 12:11:09 AM (Missions and Melee Bugs 7234):
Mission in Longest Road. Entered room with two mobs, decided to run, they aggroed me, saw a message about "failure to intiate fight". Thought "oh no, not that". Headed for the exit, but all of a sudden the room I was in wouldn't let me out. The door had that mirror to infinitely look. So I tried to logout but I was under attack so that didn't work. Anyway the mobs shot me through the walls as they were not visible to me and eventually I died. Very frustrating.

Second problem: In VW mission I was fighting easy greens. My melee init was listed as 336, buffed to 550, but my character was just standing there like it was 150 or such. No nanos were cast against me. It got to the point where all I could due was brawl and fast attack. No hits in between. Weird.

Going back to that mission, see if it fixes itself.

Konril @ 1/15/2002 12:47:04 AM (Heads up Fixers, Reckless Digitization may be broken! 7237):
I have attempted to use the nano-formula Reckless Digitization twice today with unexpected results.  Both times I was in a mission area facing unexpected attacks.  Each time I had 200-300 hit points left (out of 1300), near full nano, and facing a fully healed mob.  Upon completion of the formula, instead of entering the grid with 1 life and nano, as per usual, I was killed instantly.  That is my hitpoints went instantly from 200 to zero, I watch my character keel over as if I typed /terminate, and ended up at the resurrection terminal.

Fixers of Rubi-Ka 1, travel with extreme caution!  Our quick escape doesn't seem to be working anymore.

I've never seen a player use those weapons because they suck so bad and yet an NPC's minimum damage with them is about the same as a players max noncrit damage with them it seems.

And why does first aid not work after you have be aggroed, but no problem to use if your just cruising along? 

I encountered two waves of fatestealers today leaving nano canyon. The first group hurt me. Since I couldn't heal by first aid or treatment, the second wave killed me. A pointless death and hours of work lost.

agents cant use them, it makes MP's special or something... on the other hand i dont think any MP's actually bother casting them religiously for anything other than another thing to tab through before casting an anima since they are only marginally useful at best since /pet petname attack is broken with them and they instantly break their own mez's.

This bug is really getting annoying.  It happens rarely, but it is now becoming very deadly.

At some point you will be in a mission and if you are a healer you will be able to heal.  However, you will not be able to use First Aid, Treatement Labs, or Nano Packs.  Oh and that NPC you just killed, you can't loot it.

I used to be able to "break" the bug by engaging another NPC.  However this time I nearly died and found myself in exactly the same state.   The only difference was a picked a fight with only half my health.

The only way out of this bug is to zone out of the mission and come back in.  I get long missions at lvl 60.  I can't afford to lose my map Funcom.

Please fix this very nasty bug.

what may have ahppen is, you got whaked prety bad double crited or something and died while casting it, or it could have been lag.

I always take a few hits while casting it, i know that if my hp drop too much i might not make it when casting it.

They have no texture .. 
just big white blobs shaped like you would expect 
(actually.. much larger than i expected) 
but they have the same missing-texture error 
that you see on buildings and other things 
now and then ..  


I reported it .. spoke to a GM. .

No.  The MP summon weapon nanos requires your profession be MP.  Fixer Grid Armor is not usable either.

Unfortunately, there is no way to know by just looking at a nano if you can use it under False Profression or not.  Too bad Funcom hasn't provided a list of nanos that are not uploadable under False Profession.

Oberan @ 1/15/2002 2:53:36 PM (7182):
look up the nano crystals name in the item database on hackersquest

If it says "Visual Profession" for the requirements then you can use it. If it says "Profession" then you cannot

The agents fp nanos only change the "Visual Profession" tag

Konril @ 1/15/2002 3:31:02 PM (7237):
It seems to have something to do with a specific server.

I tried to reproduce the bug doing various things, and was able to, somewhat.

The situation:
It only happened to me in a specific mission area.  The mission was in Tir County, in an area called the Crater Impact Mine.  Outside I was able to enter the grid just fine.

It only happened when I was in combat with one of the NPCs.  I could grid just fine when not in combat.

When I was in the mission area, in combat and attempting to use the program, I would die instead of entering the grid.

Since I found out in the opposite end of Longest Road, that the killing blow message doesn't always get delivered, it looks very much like the mob is somehow managing to sneak an attack in between the time the nano-formula reduces my life to 1, and the time I exit the zone.  The bug seems to be isolated to one sub-server.  Apparently it is whichever sub-server handles the Crater Impact Mine mission area in Tir County.

Be careful out there!

Konril @ 1/15/2002 3:37:55 PM (7182):
Hackersquest is out-of-date.  They don't have any of the new mind-numb pet nanos, or any of the items from the new static dungeon.  It looks very strongly like it hasn't been updated since AO version 13.2. The news page says the last update was for 13.0!

Demetria @ 1/15/2002 5:41:12 PM (Mission Difficulty NEEDS to be fixed. 7317):
OK, this is getting silly, why is it sometimes on a 50% mission it's all green/grey and sometimes it's MUCH MUCH harder.

Taldrin @ 1/15/2002 7:22:12 PM (Yalm BUGS 7325):
I've only had my Yalmaha a week or so now, but I've already found plenty of bugs with it.

If you zone indoors when you are in the plane it changes to a red icon. Now if you die inside it is still a red icon when you're back outside at the reclaim.

If you equip the yalm sitting down you cannot take off, and move around at your normal runspeed.

If you crash whilst in the yalm you cannot change altitude when you log in, you can only move around in a level plane at that altitude. Taking the plane off has no effect, you'll still be inside it even though it's now in your inventory. Relogging solves this problem.

On certain mission areas in newland desert you exit into a lake. As with sitting down it will not let you take off, and the nose moves side to side like you're in a kodiak. You have to get to land and re-equip the plane again to solve this.

Taldrin @ 1/15/2002 7:29:15 PM (7150):

Quantino @ 1/15/2002 7:51:51 PM (Probs with a fixer nano in fp 7333):
Don't know if this is a bug or not but when i try to use the nano "Basic Insurance Hack" as a Agent in FP Fixer i get a message that says i need something like 700 nano to use it but when i look at the info on the nano it says it needs 301 nanopoints (plus 150 for FP) whcih equals to 451. I have more then that in nanopool but i still can't use it. Why?

Can anyone suggest a better nano for a Agent in FP to HoT? Note: I can't use FP Doctor yet. I can use Fixer, soldier, ma, enforcer, engineer and adventurer. Afaik only docs and fixers have these HoT's. I don't want to use a Mp pet later on, unless i absolutely have to, is there a alterantive? Even if it's not excactly as effective as the MP heal pet.

Now i usually cast Mongo Slam before i enter combat (PvM) wich is a great nano but the Fixer line of HoT's looks like they could be useful later on, unless there's some bug with the requierments to use those.

also, the dimach req gets progressively lower.

I think this is similar to the car aggro bug.  A cloaking device cannot be worn while you are in a fight.  I suppose that this restriction is what is preventing it from being taken off while fighting as well.

Ampris @ 1/15/2002 8:07:02 PM (7333):
Actually, that is not a bug.  False Profression increases the cost of all nano programs.

Basic Insurance Hack needs 301NP to execute.  But, False Profression Fixer add +150% to the cost, or an extra 452NP.

So it should cost you 301 + 452 = 753NP to execute the Basic Insurance Hack formula.

Quantino @ 1/15/2002 8:24:35 PM (7333):
Oh i thoght it added 150 nanocost, not 150%!!! Ouch! 

Oh well, Thanks for the help!

Welcome to the wonderful world of bugged npc's and overequipped NPCs.  This gives them a minimum dmg bug.  And we hit them for only minimum dmg every time.

Never mind that I can hit one red for 58 63 14 or 98.

It's that bugged green one that I can only hit for 26 everytime that really sucks the wind out of my sails.

If Funcom ever implements the overequipping fixes they talked about awihle back the maybe they can reduce the mobs to where they used to be and fix PvM.  

Otherwise --- we have to deal with Ubergreenmobs at random pints in our lives.

starknaked @ 1/16/2002 1:30:40 AM (7333):
Yes, the fixer HOT nanos are pretty much uncastable for most agents under False Profession, because the nano cost is too high.  Unless you want to use a low level one which won't help you anyway.

starknaked @ 1/16/2002 1:34:06 AM (7237):
Yeah, it's probably the usual death due to lag which happens in many situations.

The mob's final attack is coming through on you after you've zoned into the grid with 1 hit point, and so it kills you.

Konril @ 1/16/2002 3:19:56 AM (7237):
Except, I never reached the grid.  I died literally in the mission room at the spot I cast the nano.  I also have not been able to reproduce this in any area other than that specific mission.  Missioning in Greater Tir, Varmint woods, Newland, Longest Road, and Wailing Wastes, there was no problem with the nano either.


Oh well.

haha you think thats something i had a mob
smoke me for dmg like 12 times for each hit and i was ma (suppose to be fastest hitter HA!) not even complaing about the joke of dmg i did to it

damn man i died like no one knows
since that day i gave up on missions and tank reds!!!
damn uber greens!!!!

Ashuras @ 1/16/2002 6:37:09 AM (6885):
I suspect this bug has something to do with the mob aggroing the lower level teammate.

It must have been RED to the teammate, thus the relative difference in attack speed.

When the teammate died.. something must have screwed up and the attack speed got stuck at the fast end...

vespucci @ 1/16/2002 7:05:45 AM (7263):
Unfortunately not even engaging the other character fixed the big.  I was doing about 3 heals and still no change.

This bug has gotten worse.

I got whacked last night by two hardened criminal Atroxs.  They had me down in about 10 seconds.  I never stood a chance.  Luckily it was a "look for item mission" and I ran back to the room with the item and tagged it before the hammered me into a pulp.  I thought I lost out, but the prize was in reclaim.

I got lucky.  99 times out of 100 I'm not.

Funcom please fix these mission difficulty problems.

vespucci @ 1/16/2002 7:23:47 AM (I like this bug.  Can we have more like this? 7401):
I got into a "No Loot No Heal" bug and was cursing my way back to the mission entrace.

I zoned out and immediately zoned back in.

I finally found where I left off and went after the closest MOB.  I trashed him in seconds.  He was a green but the battle lasted only a few seconds.  I weild Riders and my character was hitting Fast and Hard.

It was like dropping the NPC into a blender and pressing whip!

My Melee Init is normally aroung 285.  When I checked it, it was 485 and I was able to trash everything in the place.  No problem.  When I zoned out it went back to normal.  It was nice being a Quizenart while it lasted 

Would not mind more bugs like that one.

starknaked @ 1/16/2002 8:50:41 AM (Putting ncu memory in - bugged 7405):
When trying to put ncu memory in, or put in computer deck range increasers, or other items, the whole process is bugged.

You try to replace the memory in one slot with another in your inventory.  You stare at the screen for about 30 seconds while the stupid bar slowly moves to the side.  When it's all done, you look, and find that the new memory didn't go into the slot you told it to, it went into a different slot.

So instead of replacing a 25 with a 34, say, you instead end up replacing one of the 34's that was already there with another 34 in your inventory, while the 25 just sits there.

Or, your computer deck range increaser comes out, and the 34 goes in.

When you go to put an item in place into one of the belt slots, it seems to be totally random which spot it goes into, where you click seems to mean nothing.

So it took me 1/2 an hour to replace all 6 items in my 6 deck belt.  I kept putting the ones I wanted in over and over and over, usually it would replace whatever was in slot 3 most of the time, no matter where I tried to put any new item.

starknaked @ 1/16/2002 8:52:13 AM (7237):
Hmm, that is unusual.  It was reducing your hit points to 1 before you actually gridded out, then.

Tetra @ 1/16/2002 8:56:12 AM (7405):
I replaced 5 yesterday morning without a problem but spent the time to remove 1 then drop the new one on the empty slot.   were you doing it like that or just right click the new ncu/drop it on an existing NCU (doesnt seem to work right).

Everything the original poster says here is true. I have exact the same problems.

The evn worst is that if i zone with my Yalmaha over water, then i am under water after zoning and with swim speed, well my swim skill is 40 and thats a big junk trust me. Alot fishes attack me then and i can only zone back and swim to the coast.

big big problems with this vehicle..

Oberan @ 1/16/2002 3:50:17 PM (6885):
some enemies such as scorpoids can double attack (i guess its multiple appendages). Basically they are dual weilding a very fast virtual weapon and as such getting 2 attacks

Whats worse is the cyborgs using martial arts and guns at the same time (isn't that considered a bug by funcom?)

Uhohoh @ 1/16/2002 4:42:07 PM (6885):
Hi!

I have had the exact same problem!! Yesterday i was out hunting some monsterparts and came across a giant slybane in Varmint Woods.....fine i thought, that i can kill. When i attacked it i got hit so fast and bad i had to retreat and rebuff! I was then thinking that giant was not one but TWO giants and i had not seen the other one since it was near a tree.

Finally i killed the bastard and was waiting for the other one to aggro on me. there was NONE left. wtf was that!? oh, well.......as usuall a new bug apears after another patch from FC!

Finally there i could NOT find the enemy at all...........and behold.......the A-1000 bugger was taking a walk up the trees! LOL......i could't believe what i just saw. I'm afraid i could not target it :/ heh looked pretty damn fun....weird at same time!

I hope I'm not the second poster, because I worked more than 120 hours to get my yalm when a bug ate it two days afterwards.

Mindswayer @ 1/16/2002 8:47:38 PM (Nano Pool is not being Calculated Correctly 7490):
As it is now, only the 5(or4) points that you are allowed to raise Nano Pool by per level is affecting your nano point total. The points you gain in Nano Pool from raising Ability dependencies like Psychic, Stamina, Sense and Intelligence do not give you a higher nano point count. 

For example, a character of mine has a Nano Pool score of 152 (no outside factor is effecting this, no implant, no buff etc) yet I have the total nano points of someone with a Nano Pool of 132. The 20 points I gained in Nano Pool via maxing Psychic, Stamina, Sense and Intelligence, are being ignored.

You can test this out yourself by dumping a load of IP into Psychic, watching your Nano Pool go up a good five points, but your Total Number of nano points will stay the same. Even after you zone, log, do a dance...

Ming @ 1/16/2002 8:49:55 PM (7490):
oh yeah this one is very frustrating. bump.

Mindswayer @ 1/16/2002 8:51:47 PM (7242):

You may think I'm being silly, but I really do miss getting ganked. I remember the fear as I waited for 2h0 to come up....
I don't have that fear anymore.
All the challenge of this game just keeps slipping away.
I liked being scared. I liked knowing I COULD get ganked. It was fun.
Remember the first time you were just walking along and all the sudden it said "25% zone"... remember your pulse quickening? When was the last time you felt that?

Every patch, the game is more about just running missions and powerlevelling.

I won't reveal the details of the exploit (I've never used it, but I've been hit by it)... but I will tell you how to avoid it.  Turn your aggro all the way to the LEFT so that auto-attack is disabled and the exploit won't work against you.  If you have auto-attack enabled, once they do their 'trick' and you attack back, it's all over for you...  

Once your out and safe, then crank your aggro back up to normal.

This is just one more reason why we NEED a keyboard shortcut for modifying the aggro settings.  Maybe the + and - keys on the keypad?  Shift-+ for max aggro and Shift-- for min aggro?

S.A.M.

Wouldn't this turn combat into a game of shift +/-.  I mean, with good timing, you could hit, quickly go full def when the other guy hits, rinse, and repeat...?  It might make the game a little more realistic, don't get me wrong, but it seems that this is *all* combat would be...

cyberbane you are partially correct

i have a primus helmet i think around 80's.. it says its needs 496 strength and watever agility "once u drop it in the shopping channel" but if u just shift click it ... it says it needs 10 sense and watever agility. talk about bugged


then i also have another helmet level 105ish..

once again if u drop it in the shopping channel it says 496 strength and watever agility... but then if u shift click this, it still says 496. So this one is NOT a graphical error... where as the first example is

Thats why u can sometimes where em and sometimes u can't 

i've sold like 5 primus helmets to the store for some pocket money since nobody wants to buy em.

Champagne @ 1/17/2002 1:00:23 AM (F8 is bugged 7515):
Just would like to say that 'outofcharachter-view' (F8) isnt working very well. Suddenly when viewing 'overhead' of my group and the surrounding area, my view is shifted and I find myself viewing my group from like a MILE away... It happens very often, and pressing 5 (num.pad) doesnt help. It just switches the direction from where I am looking - but still a mile away. I have to press + (num.pad) to zoom back in, but then 2 seconds later it happens again.... VERY irritating, because viewing overhead is a very important function since it allows the players to see what is going on around them. Well, if it was working properly that is!

This is outdoors, and I dont know if it is the same inside buildings. But then again, I normally dont use anything else than firstperson-view indoors.

ishtan @ 1/17/2002 2:32:35 AM (6885):
Nope this is an old bug,not new,and it has nothing to do with being lower lvl or Ini.It just sucks and if you come across MObs like this just avoid them.

Merengue @ 1/17/2002 2:46:05 AM (Crat charm disables your group's pets! 7524):
Not that anyone would know since there are no Crats...but if you are a Crat in a group, and you charm a mob, you will disable any pets that Engineers and MP's are using at the time of the charm.

They simply fail to respond to any commands, and then the group gets pissed off at the Crat - who has a hard enough time getting in the group in the first place AND gets yelled at for spamming the group with the Motivational Speeches!

Notice too that when you charm a mob, your pet will cease to follow you for the duration of the charm. It WILL respond to the /pet attack command, but after it attacks, it will just stand still until the next /pet attack command.

Yesterday I was in a group with 2 Metas.  All they could do was DD after I charmed. Thankfully they didn't get as angry as the Engineer who got killed after his pet was disabled.

FC! PLEASE FIX! The Crat suffers enough as it is!

This one is weird and has only happened while I'm in my car. Has only happened in Varmint woods.

I approach the river, start crossing it in my car, then about 1/3 that way across, I am suddenly transported back to a spot about 500 feet from the river. I am then accelerated to the river bank (about 3 times normal speed) and begin crossing again. Sometimes this will repeat 2 or 3 times.

Scorus @ 1/17/2002 8:07:31 AM (7263):
The problem with the cast a nano fix is that this often happens when I'm in my car and then I can't get out to cast a nano. Hitting Q works for me.

MrTeatime @ 1/17/2002 8:31:19 AM (7490):
This bug has been confirmed by FC, Cz or Cosmik did a test on one of their chars on the test server and as EvilGlitch says psychic (and the other related abilites) does not affect total nano points.

The problem is that your total nano point pool is calculated from the base nano pool skill, without adding in extra points from related abilites.

But as always, it would be a good idea to keep reporting the bug to get their attention

They always follow you when you use the /pet behind command. Some will even follow you without telling them too, and some will even respond to /pet guard, but ALL respond to /pet attack and /pet behind.

Unequipping/Equipping an item like a trenchcoat fixes this one for me.

This bug happens when you kill something, sit, and use a treatment or nano recharger all at the same time (at the same instance that the mob dies) It locks all item use.

Mindswayer @ 1/17/2002 2:36:15 PM (7521):
You forget to buff? For instance, stamina boost will raise MatterC. Or maybe you aren't using an item that you use to that was affecting your stats. Maybe a weapon that use to raise Stamina for instance?

Or maybe before you stopped playing you gave some implants away and forgot about it?

Mindswayer @ 1/17/2002 3:01:34 PM (7490):
Nano Resist is also broken. It too is not being affected by Abilities. Open up your skill panel and take a look for yourself. If you never raised it, you will notice it is significantly lower than any other skill you have not raised. In fact it will be the value that it was when you were level 1.

Maximilian @ 1/17/2002 10:15:21 PM (7490):
what would happen, if Funcom fixes the ammount of Nano points per character. This would be comparable with the famous 12.6 patch, or the first overequipping capping approach. I think it would hit the game balance like a mile high asteroid. Imagine all the nano users beeing about 50-100% percent more powerful than before. The MOBs and NPCs would be defeated by no means -> rebalance (nerf).
Although I would like to execute one or two more heals, I doubt, that this will be fixed very soon. 

Any official comments?

So long,

Max(imilian)

Provisioner @ 1/17/2002 11:41:20 PM (7579):
Yes, it happens all the time.  I find it MUCH easier if you damage the mob AFTER you calm it.  I don't get it, but it works:

1) Cast the nano
2) <Nano executed>
3) Hit brawl (or something)
4) stop fighting (Hit q)
5) Walk away

I don't get it, but it works...

I have posted about this before.  It's not just in Rome, happens in other areas as well, The Longest Road, Southern Fouls Hills, etc.

Why do 80% of the missions in the game have to be those horrible brown cave missions that everyone hates?

Ygglens @ 1/18/2002 12:31:43 AM (7490):
How can you say that casterprofs will become more powerfull? We will only get enough nano so we are usable, our powers wont increase you know..... we wont do more damage or execute nano formulas faster.... but we will however be able to stay alive if they fix this.....

Or theyll cast a "Use Random Name Generator" nano on you  and with any luck you'll get one of those instances where a male char has a female surname or vice versa.

I hate the random name gen, takes forever to get 1) A name thats spelled correctly, at least spelled how us 'mericans would spell it and 2) something that isn't gibberish and/or meaningless and/or shameful. This is why I use /name. Actually, some @ssholes would try to "sell" you the info on how to be "nameless". I would then proceed to tell the local shopping channel or if I was really mad, make a new char and tell the OT Newbie OOC channel. I hate jerks like that, who think they can keep everything a freaking secret.

peterrjg @ 1/18/2002 2:26:32 AM (7574):
LOL, don't blame the engineer or bureaucrat for this effect. It's the last thing they need.

It's something Funcom needs to fix ASAP. Along with 6667473 other things.

Bauxite @ 1/18/2002 2:38:17 AM (Carrier Crafts... 7641):
Try to find one.

'Nuff said.

P.S. to blind fools, Hydro Vehicles have the same icon, though only cost 50k or so. Carriers are usually 75-150k.

Nope nothing has changed on the MA.All is exactly how I left it about a month ago.

Just logged on got mission,ran to mission and went to buff AC and hey presto...you cant use that!!!Checked IP for Mat/creat(dark blue skill btw)and sure enough I was short on the IP to cast it.

This bug is almost insane as the insta death for no reason bug.Damn IP isnt easy to come by...You know what I mean.All IP is sacred.

Its becoming Im almost too scared to even play now...mysterious deaths(loss xp),mysterious IP loss(lose more IP to regain skill),items and planes disapearing from inventory(loss money/time).And petitions answered with..sorry cant help,file a bug report,which is answered- we cant replace those items,IP,XP!

This is just not fun anymore!LOL I started to log on and just socialize because bugs got me down.Now I CANT even do that for fear of bugs!

Got to enjoy this bug again tonight.

Bauxite @ 1/18/2002 5:11:57 AM (7641):
If they want to nerf them, then they should have also deleted all of them, or remove the Str bonus. (then, they would be LESS useful than Hydros, since they dont add to runspeed or anything, just make you big and ugly, and give more Str for carrying things...and using Str clusters on more useful things like shotgun and Sensory Improvement. Though the few points added to Shotgun and 2hb is nice. They aren't super useful for implants since you can't non-exploit treatment bonus more than once anymore. And the only good imps that need Str are some Left/Right arm ones)

I'm sick of things like Sunburst Mk III and FA 3927s. Either nerf it or don't, giving earlier players a marked advantage with a nerfed items is a load of bull. Not to mention the havoc it wracks on the economy. (though carriers are nodrop...)

Since they didn't delete them, I assume its Y.A.B. Yet Another Bug.

You ****heads don't know your ass fromn a hole in the ground. I have reached my limit of dying because you can't even make basic gameplay possible. How many ****ing times do you need to be told about vehicle bugs. 

Tonight, I was hit continuosly by a vulture squabbler at the eye in Aegean although he was way, way way behind me. I mean way off the screen. Hit me for about a minute, until I died.

**** this **** cant you *******s even make the game work. I am so disgusted with you ****ers!

Ban me, cancel me, but suck my blank, you are incompetent idiots. Really this game has been live for a year and the only time I die is because of your bugs. Stop everything, make basic gameplay flawless!

vespucci @ 1/18/2002 9:40:41 AM (7536):
This seems to crop up in certain areas.  I myself have been snagged by the rubber band bug.

The other day I was crossing through the big gun compound in Clon**** and it got so bad I had to petition.   Luckily the GM came right away.  It was funny to watch him run a few meters and then get snapped back into his starting place.

Anyway he had to teleport me out of there.

A big woot for the quick response of the GM.

MORB @ 1/18/2002 2:15:45 PM (Space time discontinuousity 7695):
This is a bug I had several times...

You're running to go somewhere, and sometimes when you arrive at a certain random place, you are warped back on some distance.

Then if you continue on a straight line from where you've been warped, you get warped again. I had it most of the time when crossing water, so when it does that, I simply run around the make, or cross the river elsewhere, and usually it works. Or I go through the same way, but the second time, it works.

Yesterday, I had this when going back to a mission in a borrowed hole in clon****... But this time I got warped on a longer distance than the other times, and also changing direction to try to get around the "space time rift" as I usually call it, didn't work. That is, whenever I tried to get to the west of some invisible line, I was getting warped to the east. I had to relog to be able to get to the mission...

It's been live since July 2001. Don't know what timewarp you've gone to. If you've only died to bugs then you haven't been playing the same game as everyone else.

I've died due to my own stupidity, failure to run, teammate's stupidity, toughness of mobs, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, occasionally, bugs.
But usually some other reason.

peterrjg @ 1/18/2002 2:17:27 PM (7695):
I think it's due to server-client going out of sync. The most annoying time this has happened for me was running from Camelot to the outpost in Avalon on the road...took me 10 minutes and about 20 attempts to stop being warped back 100 yards on the road.

iberci @ 1/18/2002 5:27:48 PM (Surgery clinic oddity 7721):
Supposedly there is a bug with the surgery clinic and others have informed me that it is a known issue but I am coming up empty in obtaining specifics on it (or workarounds). Could someone please enligthen me on this: 

1) I initiated the surgery clinic in Tir's downtown general store and made sure not to move out of the clinic's area. 
2) I noticed as always that my treatment skill was up. 
3) I checked that I met all requirements for all implants 
4) Upon attempting to install the various implants, the implants would pop back into my inventory with no word as to why. 
5) Upon attempting to access the surgery clinic again. I would receive a message indidcating that the action would not be available for XX mins and XX secs which corresponded exactly as to when I first used the machine 
6) After the 5 min duration and 300 creds poorer, I sold some more stuff to get another 300 and I foolishly attempted it again with the same results. 
7) This was a level 4 character that had been created during that session and I had never been logged out. 
8) I used the very same surgery clinic with other characters with no problems. 

Any links to the issue would be greatly appreciated and/or any way for me to "work" around this issue so that I can continue to play this character. 

Thank you..

hobbes @ 1/18/2002 5:39:47 PM (7664):
So its my fault the game doesn't work? True, true, true its much better than before, but no game should ever be released until it works in the basic sense. 

Look, super simple things like flurry of fists problems have been posted over and over, not fixed. Entering a mission as a reet causes negative reet, not fixed. You can heal in you car with first aid, but NOT after you have been attacked. You cannot de-equip your car after being attacked. I could go on with this penny-ante crap, but it is not acceptable.

My time warp, as you state, comes from PCgames.com. Look at their A0 forum, it has posts in DEC 2000. They don't usually have forums for games which are still beta. When I posted, this is what I was referring to from memory.

I just actually read that post for the first time today checking on my information. The first is from Dec 16 2000 and that clearly is a beta post (this is when game play bugs should be corrected. So it was not LIVE, but beta people were playing). The January one is actually not about the game at all, some nut thought the forum was about ACTUAL anarchy and not a game. What a laugh.

Anyway, I am foolish enough to die on my own. I don't want help from bugs. These bugs influence the missions I will take. For example, the other day I was trapped in room (you know, the doors are like funhouse mirrors), but the attacking mobs were still shooting from outside my field of view. I could not see them, but could still do damage, but not utilize my special attacks. Since I had chosen an easy mission, I finally won. Had it been harder all my xp would have been lost.

What is the point of your reply. I was obviously on a rant as my post title indicated. No one who read my post was surprised by its content. Why you felt the need to support Funcom and discredit my post is beyond me. You need to know when to let someone de-fuse.

Ming @ 1/18/2002 5:49:18 PM (7664):
heheheh. I love it when people lose it. Sorry it just cracks me up. I've been there so many times. The last time I got so mad I almost crapped myself was when I got nuked for 1500 as the mob double attacked (2 free shots when they cast bug) me in a green mission and killed me. It was like the second to last mob in the entire dungeon that took 3 hours to clear. Then I go back to just grab the item for a token and the whole place is respawned. Yep I loved that one. 

Anyway thanks for the laugh. Dying sucks doesnt it? Be glad it wasn't EQ in that respect. This game is wussy on death. So you lost what a few hours? If you didn't save at all that's your fault, but if you did save it couldnt have been more than a couple hours lost. pffft. In EQ we used to lose weeks sometimes, but in the end who cares. It's lala lotus land. A game.

Of course if they make me eat my 2HE skill as an MA I'll #$%#$ you @#$#@$ and then #$%$%#$% the $%#$.  Ok, yeah I have potential of losing it again. I honestly will quit if they make me eat any significant IP's with rule changes.

peterrjg @ 1/18/2002 7:29:22 PM (7664):
I'll agree with Ming; dying in EQ sucked hard. I hated it. It meant sometimes hours-long inconvenience fetching your corpse and belongings or begging for a rez etc.

hobbes @ 1/18/2002 8:50:08 PM (7664):
I'm going to get EQ right now, so I can get some perspective. Then I can return to AO and enjoy dying, in a relative sense.

iberci @ 1/18/2002 11:00:37 PM (7721):
In case anyone is following this thread.. I think I may have the answer but I have yet to try it.. Apparently, you have to have yourself selected before transplanting implants.  Doh!

Barakon @ 1/18/2002 11:21:34 PM (7721):
As far as I can tell, all the Surgery machines in the basic general stores are bugged like this. Just use on in an advanced or superior store, it costs the same ... 300 creds.

Maximilian @ 1/18/2002 11:32:00 PM (7490):
-> Yme: First of all, I am voting for a correction of this bug.

Second, let's do a rather simple calculation (estimated numbers):
Just assume the correction would result in an increase of about 20% of your nano pool (Homo Nano far more than that). From 800 -> 960.
Given an offensive nano like 'Compressed Shockwave' (ql70; 210 Nano; 447-1.021; 734 average damage). Before the change you can execute the nano 3 times, afterwards 4 times, netto difference: ~734 hp damage (ignoring all side effects).
Other example: 'Shockwave Slash' (ql66; 85 Nano; 111-287; 199 average damage). Before your nano pool would support 9 times, afterwards 11 times; difference ~400 points more of damage.

I would call that more powerful, how do you call this?
This would be affecting most directly the 'caster professions' that have DD nanos and healing professions. In general, all professions that do execute nano formulas during fight.

I am open to discuss this point.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Krneki @ 1/19/2002 12:24:27 AM (7490):
All caster professions do have mezz line of nanos/pets, so they can just use their recharges when the run out almost anytime they want. Bigger nano pool will not change much. If you are a lvl 140 NT nanomage, you will have about 400*0.25 new effective nano pool points which means 300 (woot!) more max nano on top of your 3000.

It's a damn bug...how about if they make it so that you can't reload yer gun during the fight?

Nutbar03 @ 1/19/2002 1:38:22 AM (Brawl missing on Burning Crescent and Click-stabber 7759):
There are still two weapon types with MA requirements but no Brawl.  I can understand why some melee weapon would not have brawl; they could be used as an alternate attack by an MP or NT without having to raise brawl.  
All MA weapons should have brawl though, right?  
An MA weapon without brawl is like an Agent rifle without Aimed shot.

Also, there is a spelling error in the name of the Crescents after QL49:
Burning Crescent - Star Five(1)
Burning Cresent - Star Four(50)
Burning Cresent - Star Three(100)
Burning Cresent - Star Two(150)
Burning Cresent - Star One(200)

Inocybe @ 1/19/2002 1:06:14 PM (7490):
The nano pool and nano pool cluster issues have been reported repeatedly since beta.

And I hope people will have broad enough minds to realise that a proper working nano pool doesn't just 'benefit' a combat-oriented caster.  The healers too would be tremendously happy ... and so would their teammates they're helping to keep alive.

MaxHeadroom @ 1/19/2002 1:24:08 PM (7721):
I had the same problem. 
4 attempts and 1200 creds later someone told me that it'll work if you have a lot of money on you, like 2000 creds. it still only costs 300, but try it with any less and you'll be left with -300 cred and the implant still in your inventory.

I petitioned a GM and got the same advice as above - use another machine.

Shogan @ 1/19/2002 3:12:40 PM (Belt Component Platform ? 7788):
Noticed this bug.  It's minor, but VERY frustrating.

You get a mission.  The mission tells you the reward is a Belt Component PLatform X-K or something.  The description of the item says it holds 5 NCU's, but the paragraph says it is capable of holding 6 NCU's.

Thnking this was a bug, I did the mission.  Sure enough, the reward was a Belt Component Platform 5000.  As you know this only holds 5.  Just a minor annoyance that should be looked into.

If i am in the wrong place sorry.
But this was the forum which "description" was most suites.
Since it is related to the game itself and it is missing.
i have written emails but has not gotten any responses.
wrote a petition, it was alot of people in line and i have been playing a total of 14-16 hours since petition and have still not gotten any GM´s to come to me. so here goes.

in Patch 12.8 i believe, the engineers profession should have gotten 2 new nanos. Beacon Warp ql90  and team Beacon Warp ql159.
We do have the QL90 Beacon Warp and it works just fine.

We have in Engineers professions and in shopping channels and via questions for over a month in all those and many more different ways have search for this the 
QL159 TEAM BEACON WARP.

It is nowhere to be found. We are shure of this since alor of people have been on this task of finding it.
It is not in missions, it is not as instruction discs so it can be made. and it has never been sold on market on CLAN or OT side.
shopbot has had that filter from me since day1 shopbot was online.

I am now very shure that game is broken so it is missing or it was missplaced in coding.
Please be so kind as to look into this.
The enginners wish this possible code issue worked out.

Good one! Been there - done that.  If you never used a 5 or 4 clip weapon a few patches ago....you wouldn't know about it.

I'd really like to see this nano bug fixed.  It affects alot of professions much more than people realize.

Agents: Need 2.5 times the nano required just to cast other professions nanos. (Vulnerability Seeker takes 1745 nano to cast..for example)

Docs: Eat nano kits faster than you can blink.

NTs: Neck and neck with Docs on nano usage.

Metas: Part time nukers

Traders: roots/heals/ransack...etc.

Soldiers: TMS...could actually cast more than 1 before having to recharge entire pool.

Enforcers: Mongo line, more pool means TONS more healing.

....etc...etc.

Increasing the nano pool to what it should be will increase nearly every profession dramatically.  However, mainly the Nanomage breed will see the most profound difference.  The whole advantage of going Nanomage breed is affected by this bug.

Did this happen to anyone else?  In Mort, the cyborgs were frequently hitting me for all criticals today.  This happened many times, I tried relogging, zoning, this happened with 2 different groups I was in.  I have 500+ ranged init, that is not the problem.

When the bug would hit, every single attack they'd get on me would be a critical.  I don't know if it was me who was bugged or the cyborgs, becuase they always started the fight attacking me (I was pulling), and then if they switched to someone else, they hit them for all crits too.

Like it's not difficult enough to kill them already, try doing so when they hit for 950 every single hit.

Tiran @ 1/21/2002 8:08:20 AM (7490):
This bug (nano pool points give you more max nano only if bought with IP, not when gained from stat dependency or implants), has been fixed in 13.6, so far as I can tell.  Finally.

I spent a few days pounding on Funcom about it myself, and posted a description of how to prove it's bugged, and hassled them (gently) on irc.funcom.com, and whaddaya know, Cosmik posted shortly that it was being fixed on 13.6  -- and it seems to have been.

I suspect this will be about 10-15% more max nano for most, though.   Unless you're high level, or a nano profession that maxes the base stats involved, you probably have about, oh, 50 NPool points due to stats, at around level 70.   For an optifex, that means about 150 max nano, out of about 1100 previous. (depending on what token board you might have)

The mob can be grey to red. Othertimes i do only bizmo dmg with same NF, down to 50 - 90, but this I guess is when mob is using some short duration shield. If dmg stays in stated range, most hits r doing 700-750 dmg, 20% maybe does dmg close to 800 and never does it 900. The slvl in MC does nothing and NF has no crit. Belive me, I've tried the crit chance impr buffs from MA, there is no benefit when using NF, none at all. AC does reduce dmg, but below minimum ?

I have also had the displeasure of this bug a few times.

Arcanian @ 1/21/2002 7:22:49 PM (Dieing in mort After the mob is dead. 8014):
I have seen recently a rash of people dieing long after the mob has died.  Personally I have died with well over 1000 hp left.  It goes something like this.

You are attacked by "        "
You were hit for  "XXXX"
You hit  for xxxxx
Target is already dead


Sometime several lines of conversation occurs.

Then you die.
No attack message.
No hit message.

your stats are temporarily reduce from the effects of ressurection.

And you appear at the reclaim booth.

MuscularBeaver @ 1/21/2002 7:35:52 PM (Playshifting failed, Die Die Die 8016):
I was getting through a reasonably difficult mission quite well last night.  I was 30K XP or more ahead when two MOBs attacked me from adjacent rooms.  I couldn't handle them both, so I ran to the exit and tried to zone out.  Got playshifting failed message, and I couldn't leave the mission area. 

When I was almost dead, I typed /quit to see if it would fix itself if I logged back in.  I waited for the persistence period to expire, but when I logged back in there I was in the same exit room with 2 MOBs and almost no HP.  I still couldn't zone out.  Then I died.  

My "resurrection point" was right outside the mission door. 

Please fix, Funcom.  I don't know how often this happens, but if it starts happening a lot, it's kind of pointless to stay in a mission racking up XP if you don't know whether or not you'll be able to zone out of the mission area when you get in trouble.

Is this a bug are are these MA weapons intended to be useless?

Zaal @ 1/21/2002 11:17:11 PM (7405):
The point to making it slow probably has soemthign to do with range optimizers and nano-init modifiers that fit in belt slots.  They don't want people ripping them out in th emiddle of a battle to change them because they need soemthing fast or need more memopry instead of the nano-init. 

Basically they want to insure that people do the NCU upgrades and all things NCU when your no - where near fighting.

Gnubi @ 1/21/2002 11:41:47 PM (2 bugs found in missions 8037):
Doing the last few days I've encountered two bugs. Im not sure if the fist discovery classifies to be a bug, but it is sure annoying. I was on a mission in Tir and killed Bio-X39. When the Bio died it fell down inside a wall. It meant that I was unable to loot the mob. No big deal, but still it shouldnt be able to happend. Here is a picture of the "corner" the mob felt into www.datamekanikeren.dk/ao/bug1-1.jpg (where arrow points in case you didnt guess). A little later I killed another mob that partly felt into a corner as well www.datamekanikeren.dk/ao/bug1-2.jpg.

The next bug is a bit more serious since it could result in a player being killed by a mob with no chance for hitting back. I was on a pickup mission in athen, and entered a room. From outside I hadnt seen any mobs, and when in the room I hit tab to check if there should be any mobs, which didnt turn up anything. 5 seconds later I was attacked by a mob that I couldnt see. A little later the front part of the mob's head and arms showed up on one wall. I was unable to target the mob with both the tab and mouseclick method, but the mob could fine hit me. After trying in a minute or so I realised I couldnt do anything and with health getting low I started to run. While I ran towards the exit the mob keept hitting me (projectile dmg) and just before I reach exit the mob suddenly teleported up besides me. I was now so low on health that I had to exit mission, recharge and return to kill the mob. Im sad 2 say that I didnt thought of taking a screenshoot of the mob in the wall during the chaos, but I took some screenshoots after I escaped from mission. This one shows entrance 2 mission, you should be able to locate precise mission from map: www.datamekanikeren.dk/ao/bug2-1.jpg . This one shows the mob that was in the wall (thought you might need it to id spot) www.datamekanikeren.dk/ao/bug2-2.jpg . Finally this one shows the wall that the mob was "inside" www.datamekanikeren.dk/ao/bug2-3.jpg

I hope that you will look into those two problems. At last I got a little appeal for you (FC should anyone be in doupt). I've been reading a lot of bug reports on this forum, and have very seldom seen a note from a FC representive. I think it would be good behavior to just leave a "Thx, we are going to look at it" note, so that ppl know they are not just wasting their time posting bug reports.

Xente @ 1/22/2002 4:28:57 PM (in-game time 8120):
For a good laugh, ask your guild channel what the in-game time is.  It seems that the game time depends on your client so that if you don't zone for a while, they can get very out of sync.  It can get to the point that its day for some team members and night for others.  FC needs to make sure that clients are better synchronized.

marinoni @ 1/22/2002 6:25:33 PM (7325):
iIt's happen to me 2 or 3 time. you still can go down using a kind of step way. Let me explain in my bad english: you look down with your mouse and when you hit the key you got stuck in vertical again. but in fact you went down a little bit. so do it enough and then zone. it will fixe your probleme.

Sohjiro @ 1/22/2002 6:54:53 PM (7935):

Miriandel @ 1/22/2002 7:01:38 PM (Confirmed bugs. 8137):
1° Tell your meta attack pet to hunt, you'll never be able to land an Anima on it.

2° Zone with pets and they turn "foe", meaning you have to kill them and make fresh ones to avoid confusion with mobs.

3° Hunt command turns "foe" pets back to "friend", but see bug N°1 so it's not a solution

Sohjiro @ 1/22/2002 7:25:50 PM (7954):
Have you ever looked at your Init's after the effects wear off? I stopped using mine because it put my Melee into the negatives after the effects wore off.

dislocator @ 1/22/2002 8:14:29 PM (7954):
yea...i need to know whats ups with this items. Sometimes (rarely) it works properly added 170 mellee init and then when it wears off drop the melle init back to norm. Most of the time the flurry increases my melee init and leaves it there (a bigg time nerf becuase ive seen my init go up to 900 becuase the flurry is stackin on itself) untill i zone which brings it back to normal. I see this bug mostly when on a mission. Others times i active it and my melee init goes up but when the effect wears off i lose the amount that flurry gave me and my init goes red until zoning. So of coarse anytime it goes down i zone and try again. This items is much need'd when i equip my hammer and needs to be fix'd since it has been happening since before Oct. of last year. I've sent bugs about it several time. So please exploit this nurf so that it will be addressed!!!

Actually this is a visual bug. You are getting healed but the client doesn't show it. But there is a work around to getting both the visual and healing effect. Once you applied the first aide stim immediately hit the q button to stop fighting and the heal completes. What I've learned to do now is when I am gonna use my car/vehicle I turn my agro bar all the way to defense so this is less likely to happen.

All of a sudden I see "Male Watcher: I've had enough of you, CaptNemo! Prepare to die!". I couldn't understand this as red status messages started with "Male Watcher attacked by CaptNemo" to "You were attacked by Male Watcher". Lost 30k exp, petitioned, and they said "it's a bug, can't do anything about your exp, sorry" Bleh. So a warning... be wary of guards if you have a healing pet named CaptNemo!

So all in all I must say I am very surprised by the quality of ser vice, provided to got a valid complain or problem.

In a mission (finished, but who cares) I got a new bug (for me).

I lost 11 hp every 5 seconds (or something like that).

It was not a "debuff" or a NF. I waited a long time (actually I wanted to kill every mobs in there, but as my mission was finished I had to stay inside). I was healing myself and using first aid kits. Untill I decided it was too stupid and zone (out of the mission building). It stopped.

I do not know if the last attack on me was of 11 damage or if a NF did me 11 damage, but... it's a bug.

Parallel universe trading rooms in stores: Me and some friends often meet up in the trading room in the basic store in Newland. Quite often however, we have been trying to find each other only to discover that whilst we are in the room, we cannot see each other. One of us leaving the store and coming back in generally fixes this, but it is rather wierd. This also happens three of us (one will be invisible to the others and vice veca) - hence my 'parallel universe' theory :-)

The z-pos line-of-site bugs and other line-of-site bugs are annoying, as is the tendancy of the doors in caves (the viney ones) to be clickable on even when open, making targetting with the mouse through them impossible (and tab-targetting doesn't work well through doors either). Clearly some of the l-o-s issues reported in prevous posts may be related to client-server desync, but I'm pretty certain this is not the whole story.

Please fix the reshuffling inventory bug... grrrr!

Invisible atackers - sometimes you get attacked for several seconds after you have killed something, but I again suspect this is due to desync effects.

A nice feature would be instead of 'warping' misplaced characters, they instead 'slid' rapidly from the clients position to the servers position when the client finally gets an update - in particular, this would make manually following someone easier, especially since /follow is not terribly useful in high lag situations.

I'm sure there are others, but that will do for now :-)

(Editied for mistypes due to unresponsive keyboard :-(  )

Stercoral @ 1/24/2002 4:01:18 PM (943):
yes, I had the same "invisibility" in Newland general shop. Rather often. And I had it one time in a mission. Apparently it's a known bug (I talked about it around me).
Another interesting thing is that you look quite different for you or for your friend. I have a friend playing a fat Athrox. he sees himself like that. But I see him ultra slim. 
I read somewhere in a post that some breed (black solitus ?) see others naked... or appears naked to others I don't know.

Tchajpan @ 1/24/2002 4:08:45 PM (Debuff bugs 8382):
Im doing mission alot with my lvl 40 doc and i found some very funny bug with mobs debuffs. Sometime when they cast on me debuff and after while debuff deactivate insteed to set my skills back to normal it does set them to UBER max value. Example i had on lvl 40 run skill 1018, Psych init 1051 or Nano init around 900  thats pretty funny. With inits skills above 900 u can do miracles believe me  ...

Do u know that with skill run 1018 you can outrun root  so noone can root you ROFL 

well ofcourse after zone from mission is everything back to normal but i never do that of course

FireC @ 1/24/2002 6:45:35 PM (8382):
Oh yes, I've encountered this as well. It's really funny to see your runspeed triple in no time and to have your nano skills raised by a huge amount (too bad it always seems to be my MA and not my MP this happens to as it would be fun to summon a huge pet once in a while). *grin* Too bad the bug goes off when you zone out of the mission.

Tchajpan @ 1/24/2002 7:36:26 PM (8382):
hmm looks like it has something to do with MA then, coz my doc is MA too  ...

Zaal @ 1/24/2002 7:44:49 PM (8382):
Old bug - old news guys.

Odds are the bad guys you were fighting were fixer class and it usually happens when more than one of this classmob casts a nanonet on you.  Instead of slowing you down it increases your speed...  annoying really - gets really hard to navigate a mission with 1800 runspeed.  I slam into walls.

Strycker @ 1/24/2002 8:03:39 PM (Client-sync syndrome, suggested fixes (long) 8403):
It seems to me client-sync problems are at the root of a whole pattern of flaky behavior, especially in missions, but also throughout the game. I would appreciate some kind of developer comment on this somewhere, for example along the lines of that Salabim note on ranges.


As far as I am concerned, the main problem with client-sync issues is that in every possible situation where it arises, the player gets the short end of the stick.


For the worst example of problems caused by this syndrome, consider mob combat and targeting for nanos, a serious concern for NTs, and also a concern for many other professions. For a mob to attack, all that is needed is the server to believe line-of-sight exists within some range limit. For a player to attack, both the client and the server have to believe that the player has LoS and range. The effect of this behavior mismatch is that when client sync is lost, the player continues being hit while the player can no longer initiate new attacks, including new nano program invocations.

Client-sync is for me routinely lost whenever I move more than a room from a hostile mob in a mission. This may be related also to poor mob pathfinding, but it is primarily caused, I believe, that the client totally loses track of the hostile mob position, and for some reason often may never regain it. 

So let us say I encounter an unexpected orange enforcer add deep in a mission level. The only thing I can do is flee to the main room, and either leave entirely or fight and zone. So I run a room or two away, with the stupid enforcer *apparently* hung up on a board-room table, stuck in a pond, or bouncing off some wall, and it seems that I am safe. Suddenly I start taking damage. No mob in sight, nothing I can target. This will continue all the way back to the antechamber, until I zone. On *rare* occasions, the mob in question will appear to teleport into the main room or the antechamber. Usually it never does. Until the client sees the mob I cannot fight it, so of course I have to zone, assuming I survived the flight back to the exit.


On return to the level, the mob is of course right there in the main room or antechamber where it *really* was all along, having in fact followed me closely all the way back to the exit. It's just that the client never saw it.


Similar problems occur throughout missions, with mobs teleporting through walls, with apparently distantly rooted melee mobs hitting regardless of our apparent locations, with nano and attack commands aborting due to range or LoS problems despite apparently standing right in front of the mob, etc. etc. etc. ad nauseam ad infinitum.


Why does this stuff happen? Does it have something to do with the TCP vs. UDP choice? I really doubt it. I think it is just network code which attempts at all costs to save bandwidth and reduce server CPU load coupled with game engine logic that always cuts against the player and for mobs.


There are some obvious possible workarounds to this syndrome or complex of apparently related problems:


* Detect loss of client sync from the server (how hard can this be? Just see if both server and client are reasonably close on their idea of the positions of hostile or nearby mobs every 10 seconds or so) and force sync when this happens. Could be hard to code at this late date, but should have been designed in from the beginning. However, maybe it can't be done at this point.

* (slightly different) Have client detect that player has no LoS to mob which has just done conventional attack (melee/projectile) damage. The client can do this easily when it receives a combat/damage update from the server. If there is in fact no player LoS in the client at the moment that the client is told that there was server LoS from the mob, then obviously sync has been lost and the client should send a message saying "I've lost sync, tell me where the mobs and the player are" -- and incidentally suspending combat and mob activity (at least within missions) until sync has been achieved.

* Send mob coordinates on every attack, forcing position sync in the client when the attack lands. Geez, what bandwidth would this incur -- maybe 12 whole bytes every second? Seems pretty easy to do IMO if the above two things turn out to be too hard.

* Enable client-side player LoS for 1 second following every mob attack. Thus regardless of what the client thinks is going on, if a player takes damage, the client will let the player's nano or attack go off against the enemy which caused the damage, trusting the server to stop it if for some reason it shouldn't happen. This would let me root, calm, or combat some random "invisible" or "teleporting" mob such as I described above. Clearly this solution requires some way to distinguish conventional melee, projectile, and nano attacks from DoTs or similar things, but presumably either the protocol already makes this distinction, or else it would be easy to extend the protocol.


Obviously it requires knowledge of the code and the client-server protocol for a mere player like me to make really helpful suggestions. But the kind of problem I describe above can really be incredibly annoying when it happens time after time. It appears that all the logic in the game engine makes decisions against the player and in favor of mobs. This is particularly infuriating, because it seems to me that from the point of view of "fairness" to the player, that when because of poor game design or even just a bad network connection the player's client goes out of sync with the server, the server should give the *player* the benefit of the doubt, not the mob.

PS:

Before you ask, I have a new 1.9 Mhz machine with 512 MB of RAM, 60 free GB of disk space, a GeForce 3 card, and a cable modem on a relatively uncluttered HFC network segment. I should have no hardware problems at all that would cause me to lose data, and in fact should do pretty well compared to the majority of other players in terms of the big 4 network characteristics of bandwidth, latency, jitter, and packet loss.

Why? Why is it that when I run away from a MOB in to the next room. I constantly get hit double hits by the MOBs I can't see. 

And why is it that when I cast a heal on myself, I stop punching for the time being. But when a MOB casts a heal on himself or herself, he/she hits me twice in a row. Why? 

Why is it that players can't do one-shot kills in PvP, but you got nuked by Iz Last Word and die. Why? And the MOBs will be doing special on the next patch. So now I have to worry about Agent MOBs doing AS and MA MOBs doing dimach. 

This isn't a profession specific problem. I'm sure it happens to everyone. Why does it happen?

Unrealshadow @ 1/25/2002 11:35:07 AM (8231):
I've done that, no luck....It didn't work....
What I did find tho- was I cast a parry buff (+20) and was able to get it to work once in tir backyard 11 ( to test the $#% thing) (shield req: 115 parry, me : 116 parry normal) went on mission , waited required time ( 5min), waited more (+10 min) cast parry buff again to be safe. Attempted to use, and got the same " you are unable to use ........ect"
Umm.. any other ideas to get it to work?

Alias @ 1/25/2002 2:22:31 PM (Armor Visual Bugs 8514):
Some players that are wearing certain types of armor like primus coats and elite look like they are wearing part newbie outfit or some type of green and brown trenchcoats. Also helmets on reet and other polymorph's. This has been in since last client patch. 
Is this being fixed anytime soon? And yes I know that this has been brought up before but couldn't find the thread.

Darkbane @ 1/25/2002 3:37:15 PM (8403):
That was good stuff, well written and not at all a rant. I fully agree that the desync issues are a major problem. Any network game can and will suffer from desync, but, short of major network problems, these should not last longer than a second or two. As you say, AO seems to be able to suffer from almost perpetual desync from time to time so clearly something is broken in the net code. I hope FC do read this and at least give us their view on the subject.

Emitter @ 1/25/2002 3:55:40 PM (Mission QL bug 8530):
I used to be able to select QL 180ish missions at lvl 101 - now I  Can suddenly only choose ql 153 as the max at lvl 102. What is the problem here? I cant take a group out to a QL 153 mission since it would be a waste of time since it would be too easy. I would really apreciate a way to get ql 180ish missions back.

Also, a lvl 97 MA friend of mine can only take missions at his own level... That is QL 97...He cant select others, he talked to an ARK who told him to post it here (now I am) and nothing else he could do. Personally I would probably quit the game If I could only take missions on my own level. What the hell can I use equipment at my own level for, with highlevel NPCs beeing über atm. Well luckily he has a guild to help out - allthough its a REAL gamestopper that should concern u.

Darkbane @ 1/25/2002 4:04:38 PM (8340):
Actually, sometime you can still find a place to click, but not always. This would be simple to fix, play the death nim as normal, but once the MOB becomes a 'remains of...' and hence lootable, perform a collision check and move the body into available space if it is 'outside'. Of course, how easy this is will depend on how the level geometry is held.

Emitter @ 1/25/2002 4:29:30 PM (8530):
talked to an ARK about. He knew nothing And I really didnt get the feeling we did anything to pass it on. So im just gonna keep bumping this

Zaal @ 1/25/2002 4:45:15 PM (8457):
bump..

ReddFox @ 1/25/2002 11:10:14 PM (7641):
I had a GM say that to his knowledge they have not been removed from the game, however, he could not tell me when/where they are supposedly available.

Great...

It bears repeating. 

Not sure how many others are noticing this as well, but the 'naked' visual bug is affecting all black & asian solitus characters.  This is very annoying... since last patch, there isn't any point in me to trying to look cool.  

Actually, other people *can* see what you're wearing if you equip/unequip any visible item; i.e. change your appearance somehow.  But then, you'll look like you're wearing the starting-garb again as soon as you zone.  Not worth the bother, IMO (unless you're at Reet Retreat or anyplace where looking good is a higher priority).

Funcom, please fix!!  (..this one can't be *too* tough, can it?)

Serena @ 1/26/2002 3:22:37 AM (7201):
People don't scream loud enough about this to get FC do do anything about it they are busy making major gameplay changes to really screw you up. Oh and don't forget the lovely if your under attack by anything not just pvp doesnt matter if your out of range you cant get your vehicle on at all.

Serena @ 1/26/2002 3:23:38 AM (8514):
There is no excuse what so ever for this bugs return for the umpteenth time. FC has far to many recuring bugs that there are no excuses for though.

FireC @ 1/26/2002 8:22:20 AM (Backyard bug. 8630):
Ok, today me and one friend spent time and money to find a person who can do Riot Control, and finally that friend found us a trader to buff us too. While zoning to the training grounds I got that horrible no backyard thing happen... the one where you don't actually zone in but walk right through and can't get out again because there's invisible walls all around you. You can actually see to the backyard side and all the people who go in and out of the training grounds. To get out of that you have to terminate. I know this has happened to other people as well and next time I guess I will ask the trader to meet me some place else than in a backyard to avoid this problem... I mean it's hard to find a trader who can do +85 wrangle and a high level soldier/agent within the 40 mins or so the Riot Control lasts - not to mention the money loss as well.

Krneki @ 1/26/2002 9:40:30 AM (8630):
Happened to me a few times too. I didn't zone at theinvis wall, but just walked through it. Anyway, what I did was equip my Yalm and fly way up and over the invis wall and back down. Saved me a trouble of terminating.

Ask an engineer/trader/fixer/doc to grid/warp ya out, if petitioning wasn't fruitful.

StarBob @ 1/26/2002 9:47:19 AM (943):
a lil bug... the brass light with the 6 or 7 light fixture things on it that hang over... you know what i mean i can't think of the name of it... anyway the light on it is backwards... it shines light from the back of the thing instead of from under the lights

Ejeckted @ 1/26/2002 11:27:29 AM (7759):
this is not a bug.

some melee weapons dont have brawl.

just like some dont have fast-attack etc.

no difference.

it's just the design.

burning crescents are actually kindof a cool concept
if MA+weapon bugs ever get fixed.

0.3atk/2.2recharge (if memory is correct)
and you punch during the recharge of a weapon
so you're not losing hardly any fist-time for having 
the weapon equiped and gaining another quick hit.

fights should go: 
slash .. punch.. punch .. slash .. punch .. punch..
very very fast.

probably why brawl was sacrificed in the design.

it's just another choice you have to weigh when planning
your character . .  also, only raising 2 skills to use these is nice
for a profession like an engineer or doc etc using martial arts.
notice there is no dimach requirement either.
probably not a weapon that a true martial artist would use.

Meditation @ 1/26/2002 1:14:50 PM (Yalmaha/scale mod bug 8643):
When in a yalmaha, and under the effects of a scale mod nano e.g. Ruse of Taren or Enforcer Essence of X, when the nano wears off you become unable to change your pitch; if you are facing the ground you are stuck facing the ground.  This problem lasts until you zone (if you can while augering into the ground!) or unequip the plane.

I got stuck behind a wall once. Just sit down, then type /terminate in your chat line. You will die and respawn.

Outlaw @ 1/26/2002 5:08:44 PM (I am sick to death of this Bug 8658):
First let me state that, for the most part, I really enjoy this game. BUT.......... this bug that causes you to not be able to use any of your items such as first aid kits and med kits until you zone out of the mission area is ridiculous. It needs to be fixed. It is so bogus when you either die because of it or after having completed most of the mission and have most of the mission area map mapped that you have to zone out and then back in to have to the map be gone.  

YOU PEOPLE NEED TO FIX THIS!

Or at least provide your guides with the ability to give back the lost experience due to an unfair death. I think you should also make it so that you dont lose your mission zone map when you zone out at least not till you log out. But mainly Im mad about lost experience. You spend 2 hours getting through most of a mission only to die due to a "GAME GLITCH" and then when you seek out help from a guide, you are told "Sorry we understand your frustration but there is nothing we can do. Im sorry but that is not acceptable and NEEDS TO BE FIXED.

I have talked with several people about this ingame and they feel the same way. If it is not addressed soon I will be leaving this game and going back to Everquest. At least there when you die due to a game glitch they return your experience to you 95% of the time. They also fix the problems rather expediently there. I hope I dont have to leave though cuz I am really sick of EQ.

I would like an actual reply to this from someone at Funcom, not just flames from butkissing bootlickers, who probably play Clan characters anyway lol. Well theres my 2 cents worth. I hope you folks get your act together cuz for the most part I like your game.

Misophist @ 1/26/2002 5:22:41 PM (8514):
I don't think I can see Primus helmets anymore -- they're all blue steel-ribbed. Maybe that's just me. But I reinstalled the game on a clean hard drive with a fresh OS, and still, I saw the base-skin solitus cloak thingie, and car/morphed form helmet. Some of my other texture problems, such as white spaces in walls and buildings (oudoors) resolved before the reinstall by changing around settings.

Emitter @ 1/26/2002 8:30:42 PM (8530):
leveld once more without it doing anything.

I have now talked to yet another person with the same problem. He is about same level as me (105). 

I would just like a confirmation of the problem or something...

starknaked @ 1/26/2002 9:29:28 PM (8530):
I have read elsewhere that this problem can be solved by reinstalling AO on your computer.  I don't recall where I read it, probably on these forums somewhere.

Cloudeh @ 1/26/2002 10:53:47 PM (8643):
Never happens with me.
Maybe a clientside bug.

Emitter @ 1/26/2002 11:24:16 PM (8530):
Was thinking about this myself. I will try it out now. 

/me is keeping his fingers crossed.

Emitter @ 1/27/2002 12:30:13 AM (8530):
Phew it takes a long time to install this game. But I got it reinstalled and I can once again pul 180ish missions. Thx Starknaked. The Knowledge in this forum easily get lost because of the sheer amount of posts. (I did try searching without luck)

But again thx. Maybe some info you should pass on to your arks so they can give some help

FireC @ 1/27/2002 6:40:33 AM (8658):
I've got this a few times as well, bad thing was that at the same time the healing nanos stopped working as well. Only thing that I could still use was nano packs and first aid kits...  have you ever tried to heal yourself back to full health with first aid kits? For me it started happening just yesterday, never before that.

Trinsia @ 1/27/2002 6:43:57 AM (Logging Text Bug 8710):
I think I have found a problem when you try to record your organisation chat!
We had our Org Meeting tonight and I hoped to log the entire event (as did some others), however, once the log box was cleared, there was no log file created in my char\logs directory!

Logging works fine on Private chats and group chats etc, but I think the reason why our Org chat does not log is due to the Special Chars in the Org Name to show colours.

Because this is not plain text, when it comes to writing the file name, it is disallowed by the OS as it contains chars outside the permitted values. Hence no log file created

Can anyone else verify this is the case as we prefer to chat in Org for privacy, and to log it for archives.

Scorus @ 1/27/2002 8:28:48 AM (8658):
There are a few work-arounds for this. Apparently there are a couple of different bugs because different things work and don't work for different people.

Zoning always corrects the problem, if you didn't know that.

Often the problem is that you are stuck in mid attack. Look and see if your attack bar is stuck at partial or full. If so then hit Q and it should free everything up.

Another bug that causes this can be fixed by equipping or deequipping something. Not sure why, but several people have told me it worked for them.  

So, try those and good luck. Lord only knows when they will fix one or all of them...

Scorus

starknaked @ 1/27/2002 10:57:16 AM (8530):
Yes, it would be a good idea for the ARKs and GMs to be notified of the fix to this problem.

NightShade @ 1/27/2002 5:36:42 PM (Uh...They named a duck. 8740):
I started an enforcer recently, and I had just gotten to Borealis and was doing missions.  Well, I did this "find person" mission, and when I finally got in there and found him...it was a bird.  It was a named bird.  First and last name.  And I was sent to find him.

Has anybody else ever encountered this little oddity before?

FireC @ 1/27/2002 9:42:13 PM (8658):
Once you're in a lvl40+ mission last thing you want to do is log out or zone out... losing the map makes it take twise as long to finish . Also today I was in the middle of nowhere hunting and my med packs stopped working... luckily I though of trying to put the med packs into the bank near by and try using them after taking them out again as that did work. I wish things would get fixed so that no more new bugs wouldn't come to replace the old ones but that's just not going to happen. *sigh*

FireC @ 1/27/2002 9:48:07 PM (8740):

starknaked @ 1/28/2002 4:06:39 AM (8530):
Damn, that is annoying, I didn't know the bug would come back.

Perhaps someone could figure out which file it is that is being fixed when you reinstall the game.  I'll bet it's only 1 file that is making the difference.  If all you had to do is replace one file each time the bug came back, that would still be highly annoying, but would be doable.

I have no clue how to find this out, though.  Perhaps you could ask in the technical issues forum, and see if you could get someone, funcom employee or not, to figure this out.

Naughtigrl @ 1/28/2002 7:34:45 AM (8014):
I came to this forum looking for this bug.

Today I got aggroed by a TAc just as it died.  Took a single hit for 137, which I shrugged off easily.

Next thing I know, I get spammed with the message
"Starting attack failed"

Next thing I know... DEAD!

Me and the entire group are saying WTF??

One of the MP's explains that's the "insta death" bug.

I immediatly logged off and sent an angry letter to FC about it.  And I will repeat the ultimatim I gave them.

Funcom... I put up with alot of bugs in this game.  However, this instadeath bug is too harsh.  I pay you guys money to keep this game up and running and keep me entertained.  A product that kills me for no apparent reason with bugs like this is not worth the money that I work my butt off to get.  Therefore, you have until the end of February to fix this, or i'll take my money elsewhere!!!!

Ming @ 1/28/2002 7:58:33 AM (8014):
Yep I logged in earlier this evening and decided to try a solo mission since everyone I know in game was already doing something. I knew I'd be bored and frustrated, and almost just logged out, but I went for it. 

So I killed the first two mobs in the front room, zoning multiple times as always, and began the third. It was a close fight, but I figure I had about 350 HP when the mob fell. I sat to heal and suddenly just died. I went back to check the damage log, and there was nothing. Just death.

I just reclaimed my gear and logged out with a double alt F4. I believe my thoughts at the time were "F this PoS game" to be precise. It happens. I don't know why, but it does. It may be a new thing, I don't know, as I havent just died for no reason in months. It used to happen all the time, but only after I'd been in a mission running around. This time I had just began the mission. 

It's annoying. I only lost three kills worth of XP and some time, but it was really annoying. 

Score for the weekend:
Bars: 2
DVD movies: 5
Funcom: 0 (played for total of 30 min ended in frustration)

Barakon @ 1/28/2002 8:36:14 AM (8014):
I had something similar today whilst fighting in a team:



MOB hit you for 300
MOB hit you for 350
Bang, bang your dead...


the char I was playing had 2300 hp and had full health at the start of the fight...I got no delayed messages at any time after, it was as if I had less than 600 hp...

starknaked @ 1/28/2002 10:17:33 AM (Bugs which, amazingly, have never been fixed 8817):
Here is a place to list the bugs which, to everyone's amazement, have never been fixed after 7 months or however long the game's been out.  These are the bugs that have been there since the beginning, should have been fixed long ago, and haven't been for some bizarre reason.

1. Memory leak!  How the heck could this thing still be there after 7 months?  And yet it is.  I had to buy an extra 256 megs of RAM to get this game to run decently, and still if I move through too many zones, everything starts to lag and my hard drive starts running overly much and I have to relog to get my memory back.

2. Windows not scrolling up and down properly.  Store terminals, or the menus of your uploaded nanos, still don't scroll up and down properly.  You have to keep clicking all up and down the side looking for the one spot that actually works and actually allows you to move the menu up and down.

How could this not be fixed yet?  Every single other computer program in existance, an estimated 1 million of them, have windows which scroll up and down properly.  Perhaps Funcom programmers should try contacting any computer programmer in the entire world, and ask them how to make windows scroll up and down.  Perhaps they could then work on their next mighty objective, getting resizable windows (gasp!).

That's all I have time for now, feel free to add to the list.

I've only been playing since August, but...

Pets changing "sides" on zoning. Still. Woo, now they're "enemies" and you can't do certain things to "enemies"...especially in, say, pvp zones.

Attacked through walls, from several rooms away. "You are for 100 damage." I'm what? Goosed? Piddled upon? What? If I weren't a pet-user, I'd have no way of getting that guy because I've no idea who's doing what, from where.

Team mission terminals. Supposedly getting fixed/implemented. Not holding my breath for this one.

Doorways in missions. Too small for: slayerdroids (too tall AND wide), warbots (too tall), gladbots (too wide), meatballs (mp pets), 75% of adventurer morphs (wolves and tigers and pit lizards, oh my!), etc. etc.  Supposedly they're fixing missions to be more pet-friendly, but I didn't see anything on doorways.

Scooplets. Last I heard, they're still omni-aligned and showing up in omni missions and aggro'ing.

No matter what type of ammo I tried to "reload" the jet fuel with it didn't match (tried all except arrows on it).  

Anyone have info on this and when it will get some ammo?

Well, I rather hesitate to post about this 'bug', because it is a rather helpful one, but - sigh - honesty counts.

If you want to unequip a belt component and NCU modules without the annoying 30s delay per piece, try to unequip directly into a bag. I did so yesterday (by chance) into a small bag - no delay at all.
I didn't try the equip step from the bag, so can't tell you about that.

I would not call this an exploit - though opinions might vary on the topic.

Psst, Funcom, you have to correct this one. It gives the players an outrages advantage  .

Well, if all but me are aware of this 'feature', sorry for the post, otherwise, enjoy it as long as it is there.

megaram @ 1/29/2002 2:25:14 AM (Mission Reward issue 8917):
Just wanted to post what happened to me yesterday.

I had one of those "return an item" type of mission and I went out and killed everything in the mission and returned the item.

The problem is that the reward was supposed to be an "enhanced battlesuit" but what I got was a "battered battlesuit" and even tho I killed everything in the mission I did not get a token and no xp.

Anyone else have this happen?

don't see it up here yet and its kinda pissing me off.....

I have gone to get 3 primus helmets now ...no matter what ql level they are, they all have a str req of 496.....this is a bit high....

i know some other people that told me to hush b/c their primus helmet had a str req of 10........

it really shouldn't take months to fix a typo.......there are countless gameplay issues like this that should never make it to LIVE.............please funcom....listen to the testers.......and maybe try playing the game once in awhile.......

http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?cmd=view&id=120662
http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?cmd=view&id=154471

notice here that mob attacks seem to use one attack skill martial arts, and all seem to go to evade close combat.

Eaven when its a ranged attack like Eradicator from the cyborgs
it still calculates as a martial arts attack.

here is a prediction for next patch.

Mob will use martial special attacks and weapon attacks at the same time. Anyone wanna bet? )

The mob attacks seems like a quick make mob setting wich this game seems full of quick fixes.

Nanogater @ 1/29/2002 1:43:11 PM (Dmg Bug ! 8954):
It has been stated that nomatter how high ac you will always recive minimum damage.

As a NT I obvioulsy use DD NF's on mobs, how come I so often do much less dmg than the minimum stated on that NF ? I could understand getting a lot of min dmg when fighting reds (in team off course) but less almost every time ?

Also when fighting green's I still will get less than min dmg every so often, and very rarely does I ever hit fo anywhere near 80-95% of max dmg, 100% have I never seen, even on very low grey mobs.

Inocybe @ 1/29/2002 1:51:42 PM (Heal pet and master attacked by own guards 8955):
This has happened twice already to my level 59 Meta.

* Last week
When I was reaching (on foot) the save terminal at Pleasant Meadows Omni Dock,  the WF2 MK3 gun attacked my heal pet who was on the road (trailing behind me). I poked my head out of the gate to try to see what was happening and promptly got aggro'd by the gun. FYI, I was not teamed at the time. 

* Today
As I was flying over Lush Fields OutPost, one of the Omni Elite Guards attacked my heal pet who was trailing below me. The other guards joined in to attack my heal pet. I continued to fly over and past the OP because had I landed, I surely would have been attacked too. 

Dangerous bug and unpredictable. It can cause accidental XP loss for nothing. Please look into this. Thank you.

Meligant @ 1/29/2002 5:01:25 PM (8530):
Personally, I don't understand why the mission difficulty slider "jumps" in QL.  A 60% mission at level 75 gives you QL 82 loot.  A 75% you get QL 93 loot. Over 75% you get QL 109 and QL 123 as a max.

Is there any way the slider can go in 1-3 QL increments?  I shouldn't need to be 1 of 3 level numbers to get QL 200 rewards that is just silly is it not?

Seid @ 1/29/2002 5:23:04 PM (8866):
All I can do is confirm this.

I bought a low ql jett for the heck of it, but could not load it with ammo of any type...

Same goes for the Chocolate Surprise ( looks very funny when equipped  )

I've noticed that my meta-pets become target-able in a mission when I create them outside and take them into the mission with me.

It's real annoying trying to tab a mob and nuke him when and having the program tell you you can't attack your own pet...

Slimed @ 1/29/2002 10:54:25 PM (/pet hunt & anima nano 9006):

Mena @ 1/30/2002 12:29:14 AM (Dual wield not working correctly. (timing?) 9018):
I sent a petition about this and the ARK referred me here... Here is the problem... I can inititate a fight no problem.. the problem occurs after about 30 seconds of fighting and almost everytime. Towards the end a long fight I become unable to hit the target, I have noticed that the more things I have affecting my melee init the more likely it is to happen, I have a level 114 enf, during battle I use rage nanos to boost init, also I use an FoB but have stopped due to this bug. Also the MP init debuffs cause this a lot. I can swing the weapon like normal but I cannot hit the target, only special attacks like brawl hit. The mob is not parrying my attack, the weapons just plain dont hit. Both weapons continue to swing but do not hit the target, if I move out of the range on my weapons and then back in, it helps sometimes but not always. It seems like there is a timing problem that takes a while to mess up and moving out of range resets the timer. Maybe this is not just a dual wield problem but I have asked around and only people with dual wield melee weapons have this problem. I realize I am the only person who has reported this problem so I doubt I will see a fix for it. If anyone else has experienced this problem please leave a post. 1 last thing, the ARK told me to include weapons and ql. Good hand: ql 200 Rider Executioner. Off hand: ql 162 Rider Executioner.

Here's the CS reply to my mail about fast chocolate surprise.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello,
 
The other day I was trying to use the following weapon "Fast Chocolate surprise" QL 10. 
 
The weapon equips fine and I have all the requiring stats to wear it. The problem appears when it runs out of ammo. As soon as I fire the attack bar charges and then the weapon unequips (as all do when they run out of ammo). I tried to manual reload it with all types of ammunition but none would fit it. It doesn't auto reload either. Although it says "Ammo: 0/1" on the weapon there is no ammo type description in the property window.

I would like an official answer to this matter as do many others eager to use this weapon.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,

I am sorry that you are having problems with Anarchy Online.
I cannot give you a official statement but I can tell you 
that the grenades is broken. I think that they are working on 
it and I hope to see them fixed ingame soon.
Sorry for the inconvieniences.

Yes! Remove diglets and shovlets! They are useless mobs, with annoying noises!

Maximilian @ 1/30/2002 10:46:20 AM (9022):
Ok, you can complain - can you explain as well?

I don't like these buggers as well - tough opponents for their color code. But exactly why should they be removed?
If they appear in your missions, maybe changing the mission settings will change the content of opponents within the missions. Just 'because' you are Omni and don't get XP for killing MOBs of your own side is not exactly what I would call unfair.
I have them in about 1 out of 5-10 missions. They are easy to detect (they show up on the minimap with the people expansion) and one can sneak past them. So where is the problem?
They are not neutral, because they show up on my on 'TAB'. I am neutral and they give XP all the time - if I survive  .

So long,

They should removed from omni missions, made non aggro to omni's, or give Exp to omnis who kill them in missions.

Ever wonder why nearly everything in missions will aggro you?... it's because people used to get two people together such as a clanner and an Omni and get a bunch of missions.  Since omni aligned mobs were not aggro to the Omni and the clan alined mobs were not aggro to the clanner... connect the dots.   Since the fix for this was making everything aggro it needs to be finished properly in one of the ways listed above.



	
		
			
			
				I have them in about 1 out of 5-10 missions. They are easy to detect (they show up on the minimap with the people expansion) and one can sneak past them. So where is the problem?
			
		
	
I remember getting 3 missions in a row with 60-80% diglets once.  I had to camp the terminal for something I wanted... go out there... go inside... kill some mobs for exp in the main room.. kill dozens and dozens of diglets.   Hey how about sometime you go do a mission of decent difficulty and /terminate before you level or save to purge the exp from it since most of the mobs in those missions are no exp.



	
		
			
			
				They are not neutral, because they show up on my on 'TAB'.
			
		
	
they are omni aligned and aggro to omni players while giving no Exp for killing them.   I get pretty decent exp for killing malfunctioning slayer droids, why not for these malfunctioning, hacked, broken, etc diglets that are obviously not omni aligned.

Maximilian @ 1/30/2002 12:50:05 PM (8917):
I can comment on the ql issue - tokens are not my business (neutral).

To my knowledge, the ql of a reward item never changes once it is set. Click on the item in the mission description and compare it with the ql of the item you got as reward.
BUT, for an unknown reason, the description of the item within the mission 'text' is given wrong very often. (NCU modules, armor, weapons). You usually get promised an item of a higher 'class' than you get in the end. Don't get confused by this. What counts are the numbers, not the text. Just look at the ql of the mission reward (you know how this calculated?) and this is what you get in the end. Nice upgrade since 13.4 (I think), the item to pick up in 'Find-Item-Missions' is of the same ql as the reward. This is really important, because some items drop only as find items or as loot.
Loot varies, but, again, since 13.4 the ql of the loot (chest) can be higher than the actual level of the mission.

A device attached to the system is not functioning.

then i try out to replace the file by sfc.exe and replace the file.

and i got this problem. strange when i logon to Ao client with my Char. it kick me out of Ao!!.

why?
is there someting wrong with AO server?

Scorus @ 1/30/2002 3:20:32 PM (9022):
They should be fixed, I remember Cosmik saying several months ago that they would be. In the meantime, you can set your sliders to Order (or is it Order and Evil?) and you will always get human opponents in the missions. It gets boring, but beats the heck out of fighting something you don't get XP for.

Oberan @ 1/30/2002 3:56:21 PM (9022):
Walk into the capital building of whoever is the president of whichever country you area citizen off. You think they are just going to let you walk around?

Thats what guards in missions do. They prevent intruders. And you are intruding into a restricted area. Your alignment doesn't matter in that case.


So Tetra they ARE omni aligned scum robots

Oberan @ 1/30/2002 3:59:00 PM (8917):
just an text bug thats been around for a while (very minor bug)

Basically sometimes it will give an item the wrong quality title. You ARE Gettng the correct item at the correct level for the mission. Its jut that the quality level was bugged.

A battered battlesuit IS the same item an enhanced battlesuit. Its just that the enhanced title is a higher quality level than the battered.

An old but used to be if you posted an item in chat it would always so it was the lowest quality (kinda funny seeing 100+ items being displayed as very worn)

Oberan @ 1/30/2002 4:02:10 PM (9080):
do a find files and see if you have duplicates of that file

You might ahve one in
c:\windows
and another in
c:\windows\system

If you have them in both places sometimes the one in c:\windows overrides the one in c:\windows\system no matter what the version (programs are supposed to use the one in the c:\windows\system directory)

If you find duplicates move the one in c:\windows\ folder to a temporary folder (dont delete it just incase) then restart and see if it fixes it

Tboo @ 1/30/2002 4:31:25 PM (9022):
In addition to the well known bug with the diglets showing up in omni missions the fact that you gain no experience for killing things that have the same alignment as you is just wrong.

   By all means don't give me a bounty for them, penalize me in some fashion if I am "caught," hit me with "you have made a mistake" but experience points come from, well, experience.

   I am level 84 now and the 17-IIIs are very green to me.  I'm hoping another couple of levels and I'll stop seeing them completely.  So you folks that are just starting to see them don't worry, only another 20-some levels or so to live with them.  Odds are those levels will come faster than any sort of fix for this long standing problem.

   They mostly seemed to show up in lush fields for me, so avoiding missions to that area cut down on how much I saw them substantially.

   The first time I encountered this problem by the way I tried to /petition it.  I got some snide comment that amounted to "Oh looks like you have been killing omni aligned things?  What would Phillip Ross say?"  I didn't find out until much later, from other players, that this an acknowledged bug that has been around forever.

Maximilian @ 1/30/2002 5:03:16 PM (9022):
Tboo: Very good point. If there is a risk to you, you should be rewarded accordingly - because you learned from the 'event' (any living Runequest players out there?  ).
But: If you attack, initiate combat, folks of your own alignment, you should not be rewarded. Maybe we have to differentiate between MOBs and functional NPCs (guards, soldiers, etc. that defend you in need). As we have no other meaning of punishment, not gaining XP seems to be the (only) appropriate consequence. Again, if 'you' attack.

Oberon already said:
In missions, you are the intruder into 'someones' area. They will and should attack, no matter, if the 'defender' is of your alignment. Try to enter the police head quarter of your town and kill the chief because he has stolen some prototype . His people will defend him, wouldn't they? Even if you a legal statement of the secret service.  (not a perfect comparison, I know)

So, if one 'gets' attacked, I am 100% pro getting XP for the MOB/NPC. As everyone gets aggroed by Diglets, they should give XP (-> Tetra, agree).

So long,

Max(imilian)

I really dont know.. but.. i have not diagnosed the prob.. but.. i am really sure it works the entire time.. dont know what to tell you..

Rebuff.. you know.. it sort of gives you free nano.. hehe.. use 30 seconds of charge time.. and recast the thing on yourself if you having trouble..  or how about just sit down and use a 170 T&S and Treament Nano Recharger and it will give you like 400 nano!

I always reapply it just around the 15 minutes left mark at this point.

When you get to the 102 is when you'll see it.  I never had a problem with the 51 - it would run out and I would reapply it.  Take a look at the time the 51 has listed and teh time the 102 has listed.  The 51 (Humidity Extractor) says it lasts 30 minutes, the 102 (Efficient Humidity Extractor) says it lasts 60 minutes.  The 102 doesn't last 60 minutes.  It appears to last 45 minutes.

So to the "my @$$" guy, level up and use the 102 and you'll see what I'm talking about, I got to use it around level 70 or so.  It's not just me - other NT's in my guild have noticed it too.  So take your foot out of your mouth and be more civil the next time you respond to a post please.

Ok dude.. you having trouble crashing.. i got a few suggestions..

I have never had to reinstall.. never even toughed that stupid speed read application.. hel.. never even defregged... and my game runs like a bat out of hell.

Maybee try this..

Don't buy COMPAQ!! <-------------

get MORE than 64 MB of Ram

Faster than Celeron 400

14.4 modem on AOL.

AOL in ALL!  Go Cable or faster.  30 bucks dude.. big deal.. your paying 20 for your modem ISP.


if you have better than this.. sorry.. at appears you just got disconnected.. you know.. i have got disconnected about 4 times.. in freakin MONTH.. and that was funcoms fault, and i didnt care.. 4 times in a month.. i can take definately put up w/ that.

Oh yea.. you might want to consider.. I have a suepr computer w/ dedicated aDSL.  ooops..

not meaning to diss on your stuff.. no idea if its slow or what.. no harm intended.. i have jsut seen like 20 ppl try to run this from their bargin computer from compaq.. that has 64 Mb ram.. and is made to "surf the net" well i get neaws.. it cant even do that w/ 64 MB.  and to top it off. they are running AOL in the background. and were out of memory by the time they started the game in the first place.

Oh yea.. here is a system that will run this game "sufficiently".. I didnt say great.. but.. it will run it fine.  the MOST important thing is the amount of memory.

P2-550 MHz (750 runs it GREAT!)

384 MB Ram.. (if you save money on anything.. dont let it be this)
512 MB Recommended.

Win 98.. only because it uses the best use of mamory w/o hogging it all..... *cough* like XP.

and a farely large hard drive.. its ok for a smaller one.. just remember.. the bigger.. the faster.. yea.. more data on it slows it down.. but they build them faster on the bigger models.. a 20 GB is fine.


I have personally run this game like a champ on a P3-750 (the nice model.. the one that they didnt scrap to save cash) 512 MB Ram. 32 MB GeForceMX w/ TV Out. 20 GB Hard Drive. and man did it GO!!!!!

i hope this helps someone.. e-mail me at thebladeavenger@yahoo.com and I will tell you what machien to get that will run the game well.. and other games well..  and I am not talking the baddest more powerful MOST EXPENSIVE computer either.. i will tell you what to get to run the game well and not be VERY EXPENSIVE.. 

Another thing you could do if you have any friends that can build PC's (Like Me) a custom PC.. goto www.pricewatch.com and buy parts from there for really really cheap.. yea.. cheap.. but i have only heard of 1 friend that got ripped off by going thought the net for cheap parts.  And he set it back.. they gave him a new one.. for free..

Have a good one AO players.

Rex is attacked by Veteran Knight Lookout
Rex is attacked by Veteran Knight Lookout
Rex is attacked by Veteran Knight Guard

My pet starts running a tad in circles, and doesn't respond to any of my  commands. I terminate and start up a new one, and this happens every time. I'm not doing missions, and the guards ar nowhere near.

Since I feel that something really fishy is going on, I decided to wait until I lvl to leave the borgs. I notice that I cannot get into my yalm, so I continue on foot. As I get closer to the OP next to the borg place, I get attacked by all the guards there. Needless to say I die.

I'm just glad I had the forsight to lvl before leaving.

Leper @ 1/30/2002 7:43:17 PM (9022):
Hey, stop complaining! You should already know that the benefit of being a clanner, is getting better xp than Omni.. and the benefit of being an Omni is better loot, money, prices.. etc.

Sheesh..

I forgot about that slider, it is all the way to order, and no monster Mobs spawn, which I hate anyway.  4 missions today, no digletts.  For whoever said "why should they be removed", thats just stupid.  What purpose is there to fight a Mob that gives no xp, that wont allow you to tab to target, and hides underground.  If I didnt have a pet, Id die before I could ge the thing targeted.  Thank god for /pet guard.

Koradril @ 1/31/2002 7:17:13 AM (Anyone else have problems with implants tonight or before? 9160):
I lost 1000 credits today trying to put in two simple friggin implants. I go to the surgery booth, it takes my damn money, and then I CAN NOT get the implant in my friggin eye. I right click, shift right click, left click, drag to the implant window and left click, draq to the implant window and right click, drag and shift+right click. NOTHING WORKS. I think I screwed up, so I check my implants. I should be able to use both with my scores. So I go to another city, try again. 300 credits *flush*. I move, and try the last time. Flush another 300. Other people at the booths had the same problem. Can I get my damn money back? Im seriously pissed about this. Its like the damn snack machines on campus, taking my money and NOT GIVING ME MY F*CKING CANDY!!!

Guest @ 1/31/2002 9:26:09 AM (9160):
I thought I was just doing something wrong. Since I just started playing. I wasn't even getting error messages (like the game seems to have when  you do something wrong).

It was maddening, it was my first 300credits I ever had! Then poof, all gone. I had found some great stuff (yet low level) that I wanted to install to help me in my missions.

If they game was plain broken tonight, then it makes me feel better. The other thing is, there is NO section on implants in the manual!! I searched twice to no avail. What's up with that?

Scorus @ 1/31/2002 3:20:29 PM (9160):
The 'manual' is a complete joke. I suggest checking out the various non-Funcom web sites, that is the only place you will find out how to play the game. Gummizluv has a thread in the Beginner's Corner that links to the Idiot's guide to AO, that is a good place to start.

That was an AWFUL lot of clicking to put in an implant. To put in an implant all you do it pick it up and drop it in the correct slot. Were you trying to put a nanocluster into an implant that was already installed in you, perhaps? I'm not trying to be smart, just trying to figure out what the problem was.

Could you perhaps elaborate on all that clicking, what were you clicking and dragging each time?

Scorus

I know it was lots of clicking to use it. Its because I was trying everything to make it work. Mind you, I thought it was just right click the implant. Thats how I got my others to work, but that doesn't seem to work anymore, so I tried everything else I could think of to do with it.

Im thinking it was a game error, not a user error. I had all the req's to use the implants, I went to three seperate surgery booths, and tried EVERYTHING I could think of, and none of it worked.

By the way, the implants were a faded chest implant of mauling, and a faded eye implant of backstabbing. I wanted them so I could use my Ancient Featherwood Staff. And, like I said, I tried everything to get them to work, and the only result I got was - 1000 credits.

Thats what guards in missions do. They prevent intruders. And you are intruding into a restricted area. Your alignment doesn't matter in that case.

If this was intended, killing Omni aligned MOBs and NPCs in missions would make you loose your token board. Well, you don't.

Yep add me to yer list of missing hit victims... right around 1/4 life on the mob i just miss and miss and miss with the exception of the specials... i too use the exe. I PRAY that they fix this as its damn frustrating trying to hit a mob that has 6 HP left and basically cant till i get my brawl back

Tboo @ 1/31/2002 8:00:53 PM (9018):
I get the same problem with my assault rifle.  I will start missing for some reason and then just keep missing except for special attacks.  It will fix itself after a while some times, or if I switch position far enough.  I initially suspected problems with the RNG but it seems too consistant for that.

   I have noticed that the problem occurs mostly with green monsters, and always when they have already been significantly damaged.

   In addition there is a thread over on the NT board where they talk about greens resisting their nanos in much the same fashion.

   I would guess that these greens are 'setting their sliders' to full defensive and that there is some sort of bug in the way that is working.

Tiran @ 2/1/2002 7:00:08 AM (Bug since Beta - No Broken Shores map crystal 9258):
Might as well toss in a reminder, there is no map crystal available for sale that covers Broken Shores.

You've added hundreds, if not thousands, of new items, but can't seem to add this one?

Sorzella @ 2/1/2002 7:06:13 AM (9018):
Us NTs on the NT profession board are experiencing the same thing with nukes.. Except they dont miss, they are countered.. Like up to 9 counters in a row sometimes, always when the mob gets to around 25% health and always on mobs that con  Grey, Green or low yellow..  

Have you guys with your weaps noticed this problem only happening on those mobs that con that way? Or is it all mobs to you?   Just curious as Im seeing a pattern here now, not just with nanos, it appears to be all types of weaps and nukes... 

Are you hearing this yet Funcom?  There are posts all over your boards about this HUGE problem.. If it helps you any, I personally started noticing this problem after the 12.6 patch.. Another patch after that one sometime, removed this problem, but then another patch after that brought it back.. Please get rid of it, its actually driving me to quit this game when all your other problems have not..  Its by far about the most annoying thing in the game.. When I see a green mob in my mission I usually just Calm them and move on to the yellow and oranges so I can relax..

I just joined AO again... the first thing I notice is that no matter how far away you get from the critters that you just fought.. they can hit you and kill you.. 
This is the worst bug in the history of a game.. how am I going to get anywhere when my newbie character cannot even kill a Leet?

Sure.. you can say that leet's isn't the easiest creatures when you're a newbie, but you should at least be able to outrun them if you are near death? I just attacked a leet at the top of a hill.. nearly died.. ran away and towards the guards so that I would be safe... but nooooooo... the Leet threw its 300ft long paw at me and sniped me from the hill... after ressurection, I ran up the same hill.. Yes, it was the same Leet and it was still on the top.. ITS A SHAME THIS BUG HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED!! Come on you guys! I have a ping of 270ms.. is the game soo slow that it cannot catch instances like running away when in combat?

Im annoyed.. just spent 12$ on a game that sucks!

AnotherFixer @ 2/1/2002 3:54:35 PM (If nothing else, please fix this attack bug... 9300):
Every time you run out of visual range of the Mob you are fighting, or the mob runs out of visual range, you stop attacking.

This, of course, is expected.  However, when you get BACK into visual range and withing range of attack, you can no longer attack the mob.

What I think is occuring may actually be a visual bug, since when I burst after this happens, I can still see burst damage come up in chat, but I get no normal shots in and the normal attack animation is missing.

This is hands down the most aggrevating bug around of late and it effects almost everyone.

Please, for the love of god and all that is holy, FIX this.

Misophist @ 2/1/2002 4:27:43 PM (9022):
Ugh, please remove these pesty buggers from Omni missions. They sometimes drop neat program discs, but other than that, they're a waste of time. The credits they drop don't even make them worthwhile. And it's quite a pain because you have to ctrl-tab them to figure out what's hitting you and send your pet after it. Guh! They used to be non-aggressive.

Oh, and they've appeared in missions where my slider is set for all order. It's random. But I always delete the mission when they're in it.

Man, when I read the first post I couldn't figure out the problem. I love those diglets, but I am clan. They just happen to have the profile that is perfect for my enforcer. Quick kill, good xp. I wanted to speak out against their removal.

As I read on I found out Omni get no Xp. This is ridiculous and should be a top priority fix. I think one major beef I have with Funcom is that they like to promise you the stars, but seem unmotivated to fix basic and chronic game play problems.

I do hope they learned something from the "patch delayed thread". Almost everyone said, "Sure, delay the patch, no problem. Test it till it works, keep getting input from the test servers, we're just happy to be informed. We hate the silence".

Well some of it has to do with run speed. But yah in regards to mobs hitting far away with their hands, thats just plain wrong. I guess you havent experienced the joy of dying in a mission when you out run mobs, and then you go around the wall, but still somehow.. mobs can shoot through walls.. =\ or melee you through walls.. and what sucks more..you cant melee/shoot back!

Just wanted to report a bug with guards attacking players at the  20k eastern mutie camp, I was in a team with one clan member last night and out of nowhere our clan team member got attacked by a passing guard. Our doc tried to heal and she got aggro'd as the team tried to help (not attacking the guard back at 1st) we all got aggro.

To keep this thread short, most of the team died... as those who did not was due to running out of the area tp get away.

Guy,

uninstall the buggy logitec drivers. They are the source of your troubles. I used to have a ms mouse wich works well, and one day i had the bad idea to buy a Logitech mouse. Then installed the drivers and suddenly mouse scroll did not work anymore in AO. I've uninstalled them to get back with a standar driver (ms i suppose) and everything went back ok.
Once i said that i will not buy any logitech device anymore because they were refusing to make a driver for my webcam compatible with Win2K. And i get dissapointed again with these drivers again for my mouse. I read also somewhere that the latest Logitech MouseWare are bugged under Win2k.  This time i will never buy a logitech device again. I swear it

Ok, I'm coming back after a couple of months off, so forgive me if I'm asking something redundant. I did a quick search on "shops" and couldn't find anything.

How come the shops are all screwed up? In all of the major ones, the booths are all stacked together in the middle of the floor and they don't work. Also, there are major architecture problems--walls that aren't really there, clipping problems, etc.

I'm assuming Funcom knows about this, so what's the story? Will it be fixed soon?

WGMelchior @ 2/3/2002 11:42:53 AM (9448):
I've heard of similar troubles, and in those cases it was a problem with the speed database.

It seems to affect Asian character models and/or dark character models. Never seen it happen to any other style. 

Also, does anybody notice that Bau/Waitt helmets all look like plain gold/green cyber helmets? Goes along with the Primus looking like Steel Ribbed, and Sid's helmets just look like leather helmets. GAH.

Might be the case with Nadir/Obtru as well. But not certain about that.

Ceil @ 2/3/2002 6:19:06 PM (Healing-aggro bug 9460):
I just started a doc, a few weeks back. ive now lvled her to 50.

so far this is what i have experiensed:

Me, the doc, i set my aggro bar ALL WAY DEF, i dont shoot or cast dots or do ANY damage to anyone. i got a full team hitting on the mobs, and the second i touch that team heal button, all mobs in the area aggroes on me.

So far i have been the tank in every team, not cause the others are so weak that i do more damage, its cause every time i throw one little teamheal, all the mobs start attacking me!

i thought this was a bug that was fixed a long time ago, what is going on here? i would VERY much like a answer on this!

cause so far i have been able to take all the damage dealt to me (when ive been the tank). but i dont know for how long that is still possible! ive had another char and gotten to lvl 130+ and i know that the mobs get alot tougher as you raise in lvls.

So, PLEASE tell me that this is the old doc-aggro bug, and that you are fixing it ASAP! im shure im not the only pissed off doc...

(btw if this is NOT a bug, pls rename doc prof to "tank" cause thats all i am doing...)

DaveDread @ 2/4/2002 1:01:40 AM (9460):
I only play MA characters, but our teamheals work well for pulling aggro as well. 8)

Anyway, just for your info, agg/def bar has nothing to do with the chances of you getting aggroed.

The agg/def bar is a tradeoff between inits and evades.
agg=more inits/lesser evades
def=more evades/less init

They only way it affects aggro on you is that on full def, you hit less often and therefore cause less damage=less aggro.

Well, so what you're saying is that this problem doesn't show up for everyone? If not, I guess I'll have to reinstall the whole game and sit through the two hour patching process again (groan).

Somebody please reply. Thanks.

Mindshocck @ 2/4/2002 7:35:34 AM (Pet classes in missions bug(s) 9510):
Missions = 100% pet unfriendly.  I shoulden't have to tank for my pet in missions, who can't seem to stop getting stuck and for some reason has a real hard time finding the mob.  It stands there while I get beat.  The mob aggro for pet classes is BS, as the pet gets NO aggro while the player does.  Missions are so squashed and poorly designed one can hardly move.  I play an engineer, and moving around with a pet is frustrating.  Specially in zones with lots of water and bridges.  The pet pathing is horrible.  Pets are too stupid to follow you, and the missions are so horribly designed, pets cannot maneuver well at all.  I cannot have my pet primary tank, as I get ALL the aggro, while my pet gets none.  It has to taunt the mob off of me.  Then, the mission has been designed to pack up to 4 mobs in the first room of a mission.  How fun is that?  Fighting 4 mobs=death.  And if not death, then the constant rezoning and resummoning pets.  I mean comeone, these are suppossed to be solo missions, challenging is fun but not near impossible.  The missions have been slapped together with one class in mind...the melee Enforcer or soldier.  Sure, other classes can "adjust," but there is absolutely no creativity at all in the missions, and no room for the pet classes.  Thank god I didn't choose an NT as a main character, how are they suppossed to even do a mission with 5ft of root space???  Comeon funcom.  Why not just make the randomly generated missions like the dungeons? where there is plenty of room, and the classes can actually be something other then tanks.  No fun is struggling to get your class to work.  Granted the game is fun when you are out hunting...but doing missions is a pain in the rear, SPECIALLY for the pet classes.  I don't see Funcom even looking at this major problem in the game, I mean when you play SOLO I'm sure most people want to be able to use the strong points of their class while fighting.  I mean what is the caster suppossed to do? Take the beating while struggling to cast nanos?? comeon Funcom, this is really not that hard to fix.

Mindshocck @ 2/4/2002 7:50:22 AM (8164):
I'm getting tired of people trying to make excuses for funcoms lack of programming knowledge.  It IS NOT YOUR SYSTEMS FAULT THE GAME IS CRASHING.  If Funcom hadn't cowboy programmed the game in the first place you woulden't be having any crashing problems.  Getting more Ram, and upgrading your vid card, and sticking to certain brands isn't going to do a damn thing about a POORLY programmed piece of softwares performance.  Run a game like Gothic, and look at how beautiful it is.  How smooth the textures are, and how flawlessly the game runs, on a 400 mhz computer with 128MB of RAM.  And the polygon count and graphic requirements are actually much higher then this game.  This game

#1 does not prioritize graphics.  So you get REALLY crappy lag, some worse then others depending on connection speed.

#2 SPAMS your memory like I've never seen my memory spammed.  Take a look at what your system resources are running at when you run this game.

#3 INSTABILITY.  Ever since launch people been getting kicked off this game.  And it seems to love to do when at the most inconvienent times.   Pretty simple to fix, but Funcom likes to make it seem difficult.

Fact of the matter is, system specs have little to do with running this game.  There are lots of games that look MUCH better then this one with almost 3 times the polygon count that run fine and don't crash.  The reason why you are getting all this is because Funcom does not really know what it is doing in a MMORPG.  They are still learning, and unfortunately that is why AO which could have easily become the largest MMORPG around, is dwindling somewhere around 4 or 5th place.  (if even that.)  You know, maybe if the game was working people would stop leaving. 

okay I'm done.

When fighting mobs and casting team healing, target yourself first and then cast your TH - much lesser chance that you'll get aggroed...

Seid @ 2/4/2002 1:27:46 PM (DoT's work like HoT's 9529):
Probably been mentioned before but ...

I finally upgraded my wimpy 12 damage DoT to Slime Cascade with 38 damage...

Imagine my surprise when the MOB got HEALED by it...

Did a check on the nano on RubiQuest ...

The effect is listed as :

Hit Health by 38 to -38 On Target, DoT 10 times (5.40 s apart) 

That should have been 

Hit Health by -38 to -38 On Target, DoT 10 times (5.40 s apart) 

Someone forgot a - when entering that one in the DB 
( And no, it cannot be used as a HoT. It eats absorption shields )

Seid @ 2/4/2002 1:37:10 PM (8164):
"#1 does not prioritize graphics. So you get REALLY crappy lag, some worse then others depending on connection speed. "

The reason AO lags is in my opinion that it gives graphics FAR too high priority, putting movement, networking and other crucial work on HOLD while loading eye candy.

Otherwise you are not far off the mark.

FC are learning that multi player games must have different priorities than single player games like TLJ...

I too have seen games with graphics to rival AO but with far better performance...

Something, somewhere, is due for some heavy duty optimizing

skybert @ 2/4/2002 4:39:29 PM (9342):
It may or may not be related, but I usually keep my desktopsetting at 1280x1024, 32bit (on my primary and secondary computer) I usually play on my primary computer (d'oh) which has GeForce3 and it works fine. 

However, coming home from a LAN recently, I was lazy, and booted my secondary to play AO. It has a Matrox G400 card.  (had pre-copied the AO-folder to that comp for that reason). BUT I was crashing to desktop all the time. Not knowing why.  
(yes, I had changed the card, but kept the setting 1280x1024 32bit)

After some research, I found out that my Matrox card couldn't run AO in 32 bit. I changed it to 16 bit, and things worked just fine (had to adjust down to 1024x768 though)

So, try to change it to 16-bit. See what happens.  Hope it helps, cause it's just about all I can do..

I'd also like to add my omni character got killed by an omni outpost guard in Lush Fields for no apparent reason.  Just ran by with/ my pet in tow and all of a sudden bam.  white light.  Massive xp loss.

An omni crat friend got aggroed by the omni outpost guards in 4Holes; again for no apparent reason.  Right after that, they turned on the rest of the team (we were all standing around going wtf???)  and we barely made it to a zone.

I thought that perhaps it was just that some omni guards were allergic to pets, but from the previous posts, it doesn't seem limited to pet classes.

Forth @ 2/4/2002 6:21:16 PM (9022):
FIX THIS!

Had to scrub two missions that had a large number of those annoying little critters.  As an omni character, they are near impossible to target quickly, and by the time you do, there's at least one teammember down.

AT LEAST GIVE US XP FOR THEM!

(ooo, robot junk.  now THERE's incentive to kill them.  NOT!)

Inocybe @ 2/5/2002 2:24:58 AM (8925):
Yesterday, I went on a long and futile trip - for a mission with a 'Hanshi Primus helmet' as pick-up item (which means stats could not be seen).  

The joke was - I'm level 100 and can't use this QL110 helmet which I got from a level 120 mission.

Sredni @ 2/5/2002 2:49:38 AM (The last two Soldier health buffs are bugged... 9624):
I'm half convinced that the soldier health buffs Survivor's Resiliance, and Battlefield Endurance were forgotten during the last revamp out of beta. Let my show you why...

Titan Physique Ql 113
bio met-533
mat crea-515
*Health added-416
health delta -2
duration- 50 minutes

Survivors Resiliance Ql 139
bio met-656
mat crea-621
*Health added-361
health delta -3
duration- 1 hour

Battlefield Endurance Ql 152
bio met-730
mat crea-651
*Health added-403
health delta -3
duration- 1 hour

  Now looking at those, doesn't it strike you as odd that the ql 113 nano is actually better then the last two high ql ones? The duration is a whole 10 minutes longer on them, and they have a higher health delta but those are meaningless gains (health delta 3 means that while sitting I will gain 23 hps every 10 seconds instead of my usual 20), the fact of the matter is that Survivors Resiliance gives a whole 55 less points of health then Titan Physique, and Battlefield Endurance gives 11 less. Do those nano's seem correct to you other players? Don't they seem unfinished, or left out, or forgotten somehow?

  (I won't even get into the fact that while we're getting an extra 416 hp's at 533 bio met/515 mat crea an enforcer already has a 590 health buff that adds +20 str/stam and lasts an hour and a half, plus a thousand point heal (mongo) vs our 200-300 (-10x10) heal. That's a whole nother issue )

However, if I also have a charmed mob under my control, and I issue the /pet guard command (even with myself targeted), both of the morons just stand there.  I am forced to use /pet follow or /pet behind if I want em to accompany me.  This does appear to be a bug, as my bot accepts /pet guard fine if he's alone.

they log on, and crash 10 times, then need to call an ARK with an other character, to ask the ARK to move you char, from the BS playfield,

I ran into this problem yesterday.  It appears that I was attacked by 2 MOBs not just one.  However, when I ran away across the dungeon so I could content with "them" near the mission exit, one got stuck and I got the "attacked by NONE" message.  After the battle I had 400 HP and had a 81 pt poison nano running on me.  I sat down...no treatment.  Use first aid.  Watch my health go down while I try to get my treatment to work at 100 HP I'm outside the mission using my treatment kit.

For the love of GOD, if I get the attacked by NONE message hard code that dam thing to let me use treatment!

Koradril @ 2/5/2002 7:42:34 PM (8658):
I had the same problem today. I was in a mission, about halfway done. It had taken me forever to get to where I was, due to the fact that I couldn't heal myself. I had to wait for my health to go up on its own because I couldn't use medkits. Also, I couldn't use any of my special attacks "Wait for previous attack to finish", even if I hadn't used it, or it said "... skill available". Anyway, I started a fight with a green handyman II. Easy kill. Im at about half health. It had hit me for 113 pts of damage, and I have 200 something hp. It hits me for another 10 points, AND I DIE, losing 3000xp (about half a level for me). Not only was the game almost unplayable before that, but dying at half health because of a game glitch, after I had spent probably about an hour and 1/2 accruing that xp was infuriating. 

Now, I really like this game. But, thats the kind of crap that will make me stop playing. Im paying for a service I enjoy. Im not paying to be robbed and frustrated, and if that continues to be the case, Ill stop paying.

Codsan @ 2/5/2002 8:38:24 PM (8403):
Yes it's a good post, and it's indeed what should be Funcom's number one priority.

99.9% of the weird freaky bugs in this game are cause because of the over-reliance on TCP in the  network code.

A quick overview.

There are 2 ways to send data in TCP/IP.

TCP is what they call a connection-based protocol. This means for every packet of data sent, the other end must acknowlege that it's ready to get another packet before the data stream continues. This is what you're seeing with the sync problems. Part of what Funcom did to make the game "feel" less laggy earlier on was to ignore when packets back up and to drop them and catch up later. That's why you drop dead 5 minutes after a fight is over sometimes.

UDP is connectionless, which means both ends of the connection just send data to each other. Now with modems and packet loss the way they are, you're looking at a worse mess with this. The good news is that you can do UDP, write your own error correction and STILL end up better off than you would if you used TCP.

Looking back at the mistakes of others, and to show some similarities:

Quake was the first popular game to ship that could support internet play out of the box. The mistake id made with this is that they used TCP for a lot of the network code.

Players on modems would find that it would take 2 or 3 seconds just to be able to move forward, and stopping was just as bad. The feeling was much akin to ice skating. Firing weapons had just as much delay. Players standing in front of you would warp across the screen as you got updates on their position.  You'd warp back 30 feet and be dead from a fight you never saw. All in all it was a mess.

So Id went back and did their homework and came up with Quakeworld. Quakeworld still used a little TCP here and there but the majority of the traffic used UDP. The client had it's own error checking and compression built in. The client side of QW also introduced the concept of Client Side Prediction, which allowed the client side to simulate movement for a few milliseconds while the server and client agreed on what was going on.  It took a few tries but the concepts are still being used today.

Funcom of course is faced with the fact that changing their network code is not an easy task, and it would require a pretty hardcore rewrite of their client. It COULD be done and IMHO it should be done before they kluge together any more "fixes" to side step the fundimental problem.

I've seen the posts in the technical forum from Funcom about how TCP really isn't the problem, etc. Yes that's correct if you're in a perfect environment where packet loss and latency don't exist. Therein is the rub.

I'm through, thanks for reading.

Biffstatsnugly @ 2/5/2002 9:16:22 PM (Engie w/ 2 pets 9723):
Had a problem afew days ago with my pet(s). I logged in game played afew hour w/ my warbot buddy. Logged out for the night. Next day i log in and there he is waiting on me. yep warbot was just standing around. Was not sure he was mine so i just ran off and he followed. I tried to terminate him but was told i had no pet. Shortly after i activated my pet shell in my pack and now i have 2 pets. One that when i logged out was guarding me and that i can not command, the other i can command around. What gives? I played for a few hours running around with a group, as soon as my pet attacked my second one would follow him in and my 2 pets would both be fighting. I called a ARK once i figure out that i could not command the first pet prior to summoning the second one. He showed up and told me to terminate all my pets so i tried but could not terminate the one that didn't respond. The other terminated. The ark asked if i was sure it was my pet. He let me know that he had been following me around for awhile by then and i logged out with a warbot the prior night. told me to relog and see what happened. After the relog i still had a warbot hanging around. After awhile he finally got the bot terminated but took a long time. point in this post??? beats me just to ask if anyone else has had this same problem i guess. sorry for the transcript format.

Kichigai @ 2/5/2002 10:08:35 PM (Chat bug 9725):
Every time I zone, my chat settings get reset to something I don't want. Please make it so that if I want a channel off, it stays off. That means every channel, including Vicinity. 

Also, could you provide an "/ignore all" command (or equivalent) that rejects attempts to "tell" me things? You could make it give some polite automatic response like "I'm sorry. I'm not accepting 'tells' right now" or something like that. I know you can use "afk" to accomplish basically the same thing, but it seems kind of ridiculous telling people you're away from the keyboard when you're obviously not.

Thanks.

Trader001 @ 2/5/2002 11:09:43 PM (Graphical Glitches in Info Mini-Window 9728):
Hello,

started playing AO again, i'm still suffering from a bug that I experienced when i first installed the game.

when viewing information about an item/mission etc the window almost always has some glitches going on in it, i.e. green blocky patches etc, usually there is enough of a clear area to read the text with scrolling, but sometimes it's completely unreadable, and overall it's a general pain in the but.

I'm using an original disk which i downloaded the patches for (reinstalled when i started playing again). 

anyone else experienced this issue? would downloading the full install and installing that help? any suggestions?

Kichigai @ 2/5/2002 11:59:12 PM (9725):
Also, and I'm not sure if this is a bug or a feature, but why do you "forget" the map of your mission if you zone out and back in? The maps should be persistent once they're uncovered.

*bump*

I was reading a similar thread about this elsewhere, where it sounded like an MA and an enforcer had this happen to them, which might disprove the whole pet theory.  Or maybe they had a pet class in their team, I'm not sure.

However.

Having started up an omni pet class, I can testify that I too have gotten killed by my own guards at various outposts in LF.

Makes me nervous taking my pets into town.

Never noticed this as a clanner, maybe them omni scum guards just don't have much mental capacity?

Mena @ 2/6/2002 2:12:44 AM (9018):
I have noticed that as well, it happens with green mobs. Its sad when I can solo a red with not to much problem and a green about kills me. I also have been playing around with my agg/def bar a little, sometimes when I am having the problem in the fight if I set it to def for one whole attack and then switch it back to the agg it will fix itself (sometimes) most often not though. Another thing that is driving me nutz are the team heals that reset attacks, this causes it a lot, seems like soon as a nano program is executed I am screwed, throws the timing is off or something. One last thing... with mult melee... sometimes both attacks load at the same time and I can swing normal with blows comming pretty quick, other times attacks wait for the other to get done before charging. I am not sure which way is the way the game is supposed to work but there is almost no point in dual wield if they wait for the other weapon to attack before charging.

P.S. Wondering maybe Cosmik could grace us with an explanation? (or anyone else that knows why this happens)

Fuseblown @ 2/6/2002 5:51:23 AM (RK-1 -- Can't get into Aegean through Newland.. 9748):
I saw someone in-game mention this problem earlier this evening....

I picked up a mission located in Aegean. I whompad from Tir to Newland City, then went out and through Newland to the Zone Border to get to Aegean. Whenever I get to the wall to change areas into Aegean, it won't do anything. I can run into the wall as many times as I want and it won't change areas. I sent a petition in game a few minutes ago, but maybe this will get a faster response...

Any ideas?

Seid @ 2/6/2002 8:35:04 AM (9748):
I dont have the map in front of me atm ( at work  ) but some zone borders are impassable. Some partially, some all the way.

When I need to go to Aegan, I go to Old Athen, then exit east to Wartorn Walley, and then go either east or north to zone.

Fuseblown @ 2/6/2002 8:39:25 AM (9748):
Okay, that would explain it. Doesn't seem right to me to be that way though. I got my /petition answered in game and it sounded like the ARK assistant didn't believe me. I was in Wartorn Valley doing a mission when he contacted me. I told him the problem and he asked how I had gotten to Wartorn and I told him I whompad from Newland to Athen and went from there. Then he said they would check into it.

Oh well...I'll just go there from Wartorn then. These were the first missions I took in Aegean and Wartorn (only been playing a couple of weeks).

Thanks for the reply!

Hi,

I have recently figured out that you can add tokens to the shoulder boards and that you gain stats from them as you upgrade them and when you wear them.

However the bug is this...  EVERY time you zone, they disappear!  You have to right click the shoulder board after every zone to make them re-appear and to get the bonuses working again.  They work fine and you can see them floating over you when they are active (very cool look) but they disappear once you zone until you right click them again.

Hope this gets fixed soon.  Very annoying to have to right click them every time you die or whenever you zone from one loation to another.

Malakie @ 2/6/2002 11:04:22 AM (9018):
Hi,

I have noticed this before and thought it was me.  I have seen this problem at 20 level and still today at 50 level.  (Soldier)

About half way through a fight, only special attacks seem to damage.  No matter what weapon I am using, this occurs.  I thought I was imagining it or just getting back 'rolls' of the dice but after seeing this thread I know that is not so.

This is VERY irritating and makes soloing anything somewhat hard near impossible because your attacks do not hit.

Add me to the list.. I want this one fixed asap.

Malakie @ 2/6/2002 11:10:00 AM (Weapon attacks stop working.. only specials continue to cause damage 9765):
hi,

Someone else mentioned this being a problem with dual wield.. well it is also occuring in single wielded weapons.

Basically no matter what weapon, many times about half way through a fight the standard weapon attack ceases to do any damage.  You shoot and shoot (or swing and swing) and NO damage occurs.  ONLY special attacks for that weapon then appear to do any damage at all.

At first I thought it was me, but after talking to others and paying more attention, this is definately a bug.  And a very costly one as it makes it near impossible sometimes to do a harder mission or get into a tougher battle because the weapons cease to do damage with the normal attacks.

Hope someone looks into this soon because it is very frustrating to watch you shoot 30 times in combat with NO hits other than special (burst, fling or auto) attacks hitting and then you end up dying because of this...

I have had situations where I was full health, the creature was 3/4 dead only to have this happen and I end up dead instead.

Please fix this

As far as I know when the board has been updated (at 10, 30 etc tokens) and you are wearing it (it goes to the neck slot) the bonuses are there. I don't think you are supposed to have two bars floating on the sides of your head all the time.

Malakie @ 2/6/2002 11:31:05 AM (9764):
Hi,

From what I understand they ARE supposed to appear there once you equip them.. and it does look cool!  

But I have also watched my stats and they drop off when the boards are NOT displayed after zoning.  Once I right click the shoulder board again, they appear and the stat bonuses show again as well..

Either way, I still would like to have it fixed and have them displayed.. Kinda cool being able to see someone rank visually.

Automatic Targeting ql 106
psycho modi 493
sense imp 493
this nano gives +23% to attack.

  Unfortunately instead of giving 23% it gives 23 points to attack. Now I think this nano would actually be usefull and effective if it gave +23%, however at my level (112) I can finally cast this nano with mp buffs for +90. I have over 650 attack rating atm and another 23 points is NOT worth sucking up the 33 ncu it takes to have this buff. Maby at say lvl 20 or so with a 100 attack rating +23 points would be usefull. However raising my 650 attack to 673 attack just aint worth it. If this nano did give 23% it might actually be worthwhile, giving me a 150 point increase to attack. I might actually have the same attack rating as an equal level enforcer with his single skill weapon.

 I know ya'll live in the past and still revile soldiers cause of our alpha strike days, but does this nano seem right to you?

Fuseblown, Darkbane is correct, when you exit the west gate in Newland and run south down the road until you zone, then turn west and run towards Agean, you will zone at some point and be right next to a lava pit. Stay to the left and you will zone into Agean

Before you flame away trying lvling up newbie!

when you start useing the +102 and above the time listed is higher than the HE lasts.  The HE last's for about 30 mins and the nano states that it should last 45 mins.

also with nt dot's every dot above slime cascade (-38 dmg) give's npcs a hot with the dot. (in case you don't know hot=heal over time and dot= damage over time)

It's because of people like you that the high lvl game never gets fixed, sitting here screaming on the boards that something isnt broke when a high lvl play complians and you truely havent even play the prof yet!

Ampris @ 2/6/2002 5:56:14 PM (9768):
The getting really small when zoning causing you to move really slowly issue should have been fixed in 13.6.  At least, that is what the patch notes indicated.

"Nano Changes: 
* Size problems with the Ruse of Taren lines have been fixed "

Misophist @ 2/6/2002 6:51:04 PM (Quantum Wings -- drops after zone post 13.6 9910):
Has anybody else noticed that Quantum Wings now drops after zoning?

Tiran @ 2/6/2002 7:31:05 PM (943):
Well, if you are 'invisible/not there' in a store to a friend, try both of you hittng F9.  You may well find that you aren't IN the same 'store'/playfield. (check the playfield ID numbers)

Stores are autogenerated, and it's possible, apparently, for you to get a different one generated at the same door, perhaps if the 'current' live store there is overfull.   Normally, if someone is 'in' a store behind a particular door, anyone entering should be placed 'in' that specific store playfield, but, it doesn't always work that way.

muftak @ 2/6/2002 11:25:41 PM (Mobs casting too fast and chain casting Mission ruined again. 9971):
Ok lets start by saying most of the new patch is cool i like it alot apart from bugs and some changes that wernt in the patch notes.


1: Lets see mobs chain casting nukes dosnt seem to bad on the heals but whn you get  a seasoned dealer that never cast before patch and starts to after the patch , chain cast 300 point health freeloaders 1 after another its not fun.

 I counted got about 2 messages that said seasoned mob begins to cast Major health freeloader and 3 times just said you were hit for 300 damage in a space of ten secs.

Also got 5 abolish rage on me in a space of 5 secs 1 with a message then it said Abolish rage terminated and abolish rage comes on again happens 5 more times in 1 fight.

2:Bag not closing on 1st attempt not major just very annoying , you close them they reopen 1 sec later.

3: Thanks for saying you fixed the MA special bug where if you got full nano using a specail wouldnt reduce.


please get the top one sorted as its really crappy ASAP.

Fuseblown @ 2/7/2002 12:12:48 AM (9748):
Okay will try that, thanks!

Carthief @ 2/7/2002 1:48:29 AM (9259):
Ive had the same problems, get to step 3 and it gets bugged.  A long time ago with my first character i was able to make a few Q30ish weeapons and a Q50 gun (cant remember what is was though).  Ive tried an array of recipies, melee and ranged an NONE of them work.  I didnt see weapon smithing anywhere in teh latest patch notes either  :/

Carthief @ 2/7/2002 1:53:35 AM (Nano 'Walk The Grid' is bugged 10003):
The trader Nano 'Walk the Grid' (team grid nano) also teleports people that WERE in your group to the grid.  Even if they had left well before the start of the program, they still get transfered to the grid.

Carthief @ 2/7/2002 1:57:04 AM (Trader Charm Nanos 10004):
In the description in the Trader Charm Nano line it says that you will be unable to move unless your concentration is broken by being violently shaken (which i would understand as being attacked), but no matter what happens i cannot do anything until the nano expires.. which can be up to 15:00 even if my 'pet' has died and im being attacked.  This doesnt seem right.  what am i concentrating on if my pet is dead?  Also, if i use this nano anywhere near a guard, the guard gets mad and kills me.  All i can do is wait to be killed.

muftak @ 2/7/2002 2:24:53 AM (9971):
got a reply from my petition .

WE are aware of the problems and are looking into it.

Well atleast we know whats going on

tawno @ 2/7/2002 3:08:50 AM (Cant chat? 10016):
<..................> <-the sound of my characters saying absolutely zilch. I have just patched and when I press enter the chat interface opens up as normal, but then I cant type anything in. And of course this happens just before I see some of the best deals I could wish for in the shopping channel  <..............> <- sound of my char jumping up and down mouth moving in furious silent, impotent curses. Is anyone else resorting to pen and paper or is it just me?

And yes I tried the japanese CTRL+I to see if that mad a diff, no luck

Misophist @ 2/7/2002 6:14:13 AM (9971):
Oh, so it's a problem and not a new feature to make the game um, more fun. Good to know.

Kodiene @ 2/7/2002 9:21:23 AM (>>13.6 Known/Unknown bugs List Here<< 10058):
Wow was tonite bad. I really feel bad for the Alpha ARKS and GM's today. 

These are my personal problems I have had in 3 hours of playtime in AO: 

-Getting outta yalm I lose (visually) all of my armor minus helmet. 

-When opening my bank and then opening a backpack on me it closes the bank window. 

-Opening the Journeyman backpack will open numerous packs at the same time and when I click them to close it will pop back up 2x in a row. 

-Warping 

-Appearing even more tiny when casting Essence of Colossus!? (I'm a Trox Enf) Everyone was asking if I was blitzing! 

-Nano's not working 

-Backpack rearranging is worse than ever. Scroll down to the bottom of a pack and the last items on that row after you close the pack will appear at the top once its reopened. Rinse and repeat. 

-Client.exe is eating 2x as much mem after the prog is closed. 

-None of the insurance centers responded. 

-1st person view of yalm clips thru the top. 

Thats all I remember right now. I waited for 97 /pets before mine

Kodiene @ 2/7/2002 9:23:53 AM (8514):
I happens to my white Trox enforcer when getting outta my yalm

Desoul @ 2/7/2002 11:49:13 AM (10016):
I am also having this problem -  as I am a pet user, this means that I effectively cannot play (no pet commands). Any ideas on how to fix this?

Wazzup @ 2/7/2002 1:44:36 PM (10016):
I have the exact same problem, and have written FUNCOM support...Haven't heard back yet.  I was hoping people on the board would react a little faster than the Norway guys, but it must not be that common a problem....At least I can play on one of the two machines that I have the game installed on, so I think it has something to do with the older machine (3.5 years old Win 95 300 mhz and GeForce 2 MX) that I am using at one location.  The game, otherwise, plays flawlessly (except for the crummy lag at times).  I wonder whether the font that they are using changed with the patch, and is not recognized by older machines?  Well we will see...

Rockgod @ 2/7/2002 2:01:06 PM (9723):
Don't know how to fix it but i would say your going to be very wanted in teams.

yeah sounds about right, my PC is an old Win95 install.

Biffstatsnugly @ 2/7/2002 5:03:41 PM (9723):
Dont i wish. hehe

The ARK finally was able to delete the extra warbot after alot of fiddling around. Told me he had to treat it as a monster and not a pet becuase for some reason it was not attaching to me and that was why i was able to summon a second pet. Who knows.

Desoul @ 2/7/2002 5:44:49 PM (10016):
Yup so is mine.
Might have been nice if they had mentioned this in the patch notes - 

"People running the game under win95 will no longer be able to issue any commands or chat  in any way"

Again Win2k crashing again.  Was fine previous to this patch.  No crashes since 12.8ish or so until now.

No. You still are under the yalm. Just instead of having the base of the yalm at the top u have obvious no-clipping thru said base. No-clip isn't on purpose.....in the past yes but now?

Haulerhogg @ 2/8/2002 10:04:02 AM (A.R.K is broken 10284):
I've given myself a full 12hrs to calm down, and I'm not even going to use names.
I spent half an hour metting up with my team mates, then half an hour waiting for them to get buffs and wrangles so we could head out. 1 hour total. We go killing for 20 minutes and the get ourselves transported back to the reclaim terminal via some guards that are supposedly on our side, but just decided that today they might switch teams.
So i try to stay cool, and send off a petition (something I've never really felt the need for before), not because of the xp (52K) but the time involved and the cirumstances in which our deaths were brought about.
After waiting, and waiting, and waiting........ I get a Macro response, along the lines or 'thank you and please come again'.
I lose my temper.
It happens.
After a few curt words, an A.R.K shows up to tell me nothing can be done, that funcom know about the problem, and that everything will be alright after the next patch.
Yeah right.
I asked to speak to someone in charge..... I'm told that either i can email funcom, or talk to him.
At the end of this discussion, I finally realise the horrible truth. I'm talking to nothing but a greeter. No power to do anything, just sit there and talk to you ( for which the macro response was even more of a slap in the face). 
Do away with arks and slap a few banners round the place, and dont think that just because you lose a few xp and a couple of hours, you shouldnt be reimbursed for your problems.
Guards killing players for no reason sucks.
It causes the level of fun in the game to decrease rapidly.
The fact that noone could be arsed to help you out when it does happen is even worse.
I'd rather just get a automatic response, than the one key stroke macro it takes for an A.R.K to bother replying to you.
They have no more power that a level 1 newb in trade, and they certainly are just as effective.
So next time something goes wrong with your pal, let him rant to you and you can sing the praises of Funcom, like they were jesus. Cause at least it'll be from someone they know, and not a wannabe lost in game mechanics rather than real life.
I am A.R.K......yeah so?

Riot @ 2/8/2002 4:38:53 PM (10016):
I have had the same problem. My Guild President /petitioned for me ingame and he said that the GM said it is due to win95. The ingame chat client is based on Java. Win95 has old java stuff. I was told to upgrade. I downloaded somthing off of microsoft.com and i dont know yet if it works cause im at school at the moment. also they may have fixed this in the 13.7 patch hopefully.

Basher Tarr @ 2/9/2002 6:24:52 AM (Bug with the new backpacks, includes excrept of an email sent to Funcom 10495):
My friends, I come here to warn you of a potentially damaging bug introduced with 13.6, I believe this eMail sent to Funcom Support explains it rather clearly


	
		
			
			
				Dear CS rep. for Funcom
After being told by Advisor Markell to fill out a bug report describing the bug I encountered I am here doing so.

As you know, the last content patch, 13.6, introduced a set of new backpacks, named and with different icons. As one of my guild's bankers I rejoiced at the addition, management would become easier.

Today, one of my guildies asked for some items from the bank, particularly a set of Implants i will describe:

QL30 Head  : Shining Creation; Bright High RoF
QL30 Chest : Shining Life; Faded Sensitivity
QL30 Ear   : Bright Sneaking; Faded Psycho Babble
QL30 Eye   : Faded Warfare
QL30 R Arm : Shining Warfare; Faded Radiation Resist
QL30 R Wri : Shining High RoF
QL30 R Hand: Bright Warfare; Faded High RoF

Also in the backpack was a QL20 Flamethrower

These items were put into a Large Backpack - Implants and given to the other player (he could SEE the backpack in his inventory, so the backpack was actually traded). When he right clicked on the backpack, the backpack disappeared and the message "Side Tokens Collected: 0" was produced.

Now, Advisor Markell insisted that items lost during a trade are the sole responsibility of the partied involved (which makes no sense, since its not the parties involved that write the code, and this puzzles me), even though I insisted that the dissapearence of the said backpack accured AFTER it was tradedm not during trade. It was, definitely, a consequence of the trade.

I come, through this mail, request 2 things:

1 - That the matter is investigated and fixed, also take a look around your QA department to see how such an obvious bug could have passed.

2 - That you either reimburse the items, or the value in credits you think they assume.

Failure to comply with request 1 will be met with loss of respect, both from me, the ones i know in game, and the community as a whole, as well as being a sign of lack of professionalism.

Failure to comply with request 2 will result in termination of my current account (-SNIP-).

I hope I have made myself clear enough, and I pray Funcom will do the right thing for once.

Yours truly
-SNIP-


			
		
	
Be advised, dont trade valuable items inside the new backpacks. While this happened with a measly set of implants and a flamethrower , it could have been a full set of QL200 Nano Armor and a QL200 Stigma.

Serena @ 2/9/2002 7:13:30 AM (10495):
Problem is that if they did replace the to numerous items lost to their own bad programming they wouldnt have time to make more bugs for us to complain about.

Serena @ 2/9/2002 7:22:54 AM (9345):
The problem is you healed someone the guard was hostile to, a clanner, shame on you for teaming with one as an omni in omni territory. So it put you on the guards hate list. Its not unreasonable infact its how it should be.

Even if you are already on RK1, think of all the people on RK2 that would be such a wonderful addition to RK1 if this was given to all players and not just the one or two that have special relationships with the GM's, ARKS's or the programers.

heads up guys foudn this bug awhile back but really didn't recognize it until a few days ago the nano " disruptive field negator" which is supposed to damage youe enemies every 20 seconds and reduce the damage from a damage shield does not work properly. Sure it does reduce the damage from damage shields by the 4 points it is supposed to but the other part is what is not working. the part where a nanobot cloud attacks your enemies for some reason I keep getting the message " you can't attack your pet" as if the nano was trying to attack my pet. K I thought it was supposed to attack my enemies not my bot????? strange

Tiran @ 2/10/2002 4:31:58 AM (9345):
There's also a bug around causing pets to 'lose' affiliation, becoming non-omni/clan, and thus, subject in some circumstances to being aggroed by guards... and if you own such a pet, well, you come in for 'guard love' as well.

Bonefish @ 2/10/2002 12:25:15 PM (Omni Grey Suit Shirt  (male version) 10632):
COSMIK  DAI-GALEAN  CZ

My org established itself in late August last year, and we quickly decided to be a be a little different and adopt the "Omni Grey Suit" uniform as our org uniform.  We are a very heavily RP based OT org, so things like a uniform are very important to us.

Therefore, we immediately acquired all the "Omni Grey Suit" boots, pants, skirts, sleeves, and female shirts we needed.  No problem there.

However... to this day, some six months later we've still not seen one single "Omni Grey Suit Shirt", i.e. the male suit shirt, in any shop we've visited.

EVERY time any of us pass any shop, we dive in and check out the OT clothes machine on the off chance there will be one.  We have a standing order that the first to find it buys 30 or so.

Trust me when I say after six months we have been into a LOT of clothes machines

However, it is now getting extremely tedious, and after six months is actually starting to get us a bit pissed.

I know the "Omni Grey Suit Shirt" exists as I see it worn by LOTS of OT NPCs walking around, I've seen it on a player character about a month ago, and found it in about 5-6 online item databases on the WWW.

Therefore, I know it exists.

It does not add to any stats, it does not "do" anything.  It is just an item of OT uniform clothing.

Why is the female one available freely, yet the male one is missing/not available?  Sexism?

I think it is probably just a bug that prevents the shirt from appearing in the shops.  Can you look into it?

Can someone "who knows" from FC feed something back to me?

I have asked ARKs about 5-6 times now, each time I get a different answer why it is not available, each time it sounds like their guessing or fabricating an answer impulsively.

I could understand all this if it was an item that did something.  However, it is just a piece of dumb clothing man...

Please help us poor RPers enjoy the game a bit more?  Fix/enable "Omni Grey Suit Shirts.”

Equality for male shirt wearers!!

Thanks for any feedback in advance.

haniblecter @ 2/10/2002 7:59:56 PM (Horrible bug with the agent false proffesion line! 10669):
Discovered after i came back from canceling, the agent false proffesion lines nano cost is waaay more then it should be!

As part of the penalties restricted on the FP line of nano's, the casting cost of all nano's while assuming another proffesion should be 150% the casting cost.

Not so, the casting cost is more like 250% !!!!!

Ex: Metabolism booster - 248 Na Cost x 150% = 372
Actual stated (by the game) cost of the program while under the Doctor proffesion - 620....2.5x or 250%

Thats well nigh impossible to reach alot of the nano's that people use...not to mention its a full 100% more then the stated value.

Please fix this dastardly bug Funcom...Pretty please?

Neutrox @ 2/10/2002 8:16:05 PM (I wanna report a bug...!!!!!! 10670):
and it could be reffered to as "anarchy online" because there is no specific bug, the whole crappy game is a bug! They start "fixing" bugs but create even more bugs than they fix!!
I dont want any stupid new backpacks! I want the bugs fixed!

Why should I still be paying for a beta version game? If you cant fix the bugs, please tell me right now and I will cancel my account! But, I guess FunCon would be very reluctant in doing so because they are too greedy to listen to the users at all!

Berlioz @ 2/10/2002 8:47:11 PM (10581):
Maybe the 600 - 1000 damage are the crits (critical hits)?

Krneki @ 2/10/2002 9:08:07 PM (10669):
The description is quite correct. NPCostModifier set to 150 means in your case 248 + 248*1.5 = 620. Anyway, it should cost more, cuz Falso Profession is a n00b nano. Have you checked the Mimic Profession line? if you would cast that in your case that nano would cost to cast 248 + 248*0.15 = 285.

Agen't wasn't meant to cast the highest lvl nanos other profession have in the first place. Otherwise everyone would be agents

Been there, done that.

My understanding of the slider is that mostly you will have mobs your level.  Some will be higher.  Some will be lower.  Not every one fo them will be exactly the level of the slider.  There is variation.

So, maybe three oranges in the front room were offset by three greens deeper in.

Chaeers,

MartekO @ 2/10/2002 10:14:21 PM (467):
This is an old message, but this problem can still occur.

Today my son saved in Broken Shores, then died in mission, and spawned in the same place (Mountain of Four Lakes).

No matter how many times he tried getting out of there, he would respawn there.  He simply could not get out of there.  There is no save terminal there, though there is the respawn point and a Reclaim Terminal.  There's also a shop.

It's a small 100% area surrounded by 25% that is basically impossible for a lower-level char to leave (due to aggro mobs - we didn't see any PC's at all).  It's a poor spawn point for saving back at Broken Shores clan Ins Term (which is pretty far away from 4 lakes).

At first a GM told him nothing could be done.  THen again after the second petition.

I logged on my account and dialoged with the GM, and he transported my son back to Tir.  I reported the following coords as the exact spawn point:

Pos: 1578.3, 3001.8, 13.9 PF:665
Mountain of Four Lakes
CharID 50000:163784709

Cheers,

I'm not sure. But it still seems weird... am i the only one this happens too?

what are you other people getting hit for by the Minions, and what is your level, AC and Evades?

Could someone at funcom ever answer a stinking question? what should i be getting hit for???

One version hits me for 30 points of damage every hit and I can kill them fairly easily, the other kind hits me for 500 pts plus and they kill me in 5 hits or so. I thought it might have to do with weapons or something but the club wielders and the sword wielders are equally likely to be either sort.

 Kinda weird

This isn't a major bug with the new patch, but with both 13.6 and 13.7 I have noticed that my Senpai Tertius Decus Armor Coat  ( I think that's the correct spelling)  the reddish-brown one, will now turn black when I exit my Yalmaha.  I don't know if anone else sees my coat as black as I haven't asked them.  First time it happened I had to do a quick check to see how I had suddenly gotten a Nano Cloak, hehe.   I suppose I won't see it anymore as I just traded for a higher QL Hanshi coat

Misophist @ 2/11/2002 1:26:58 AM (9910):
I posted this elsewhere, but it's the same bug some of us saw with our Yalms a few patches back. If you had any implants for air vehicle or a main skill that augmented air vehicle, your plane would drop while zoning. Well, all it took to correct that was boosting air vehicle until the plane stopped falling off. 

With masteries and my pillow and everything, I've got a ways to go until I meet the base-skill requirements for QW.

Chocotoff @ 2/11/2002 2:09:45 AM (Crashing constanly after flying into 20k store 10698):
I drove with my Yalmaha into the shop in PM (20k) Outpost. 
When I did that, the game gave me a black screen, after 10 minutes of waiting still a black screen. 
I quited AO (ctrl-alt-del) and rebooted Pc. 
I logged in and my character (in the yalmaha) directly wanted to zone into the shop => same problem agian, had to ctrl-alt-del to stop the game. 
And this over and over again... 

What's happening with me ?  
Is there a solution ?

No, I would say that the mobs are just critting you.


In my case its either 36, or 630 odd damage. Any mob can go 36,36,36,36,630,630,36,630 or so.

Just appears to be the "Weapon" that the minions use.

Bestor @ 2/11/2002 2:42:01 AM (A fun new bug... a must read Cosmik 10704):
Ok this bug has already cost me over 1 million xp, but im not really pissed at the xp loss.  I pissed caused this bug cost me time, time that i have spent hunting getting xp and the Mission Objective.  It happened twice, both were the new cave missions.

Here's what happens, u go into the mission and kill some of the mobs or most of the mobs and all of a sudden the server crashes.  When you log back in all the mobs are back and if you got the MO(Mission Objective) you loose it.  It seems that the server resets and everything is time warped back.  However the loot I got from mobs and treasure chests is kept.  so now when I log back on I'm surrounded by mobs and I start do take alot of damage and then die.  It's funny how all the mobs are back and I have no map cause i just logged on and I'm totally lost.

FIX THIS LIKE YOU FIXED THE BUGS THAT CAUSED RED MOBS TO ALLWAYS GET CRITICALLY HIT!

Paldorr @ 2/11/2002 2:53:24 AM (13.7 - the return of the mirror effect door.. 10705):
With 13.7 mirror doors have returned.  Three missions in Rome exhibited the dreaded mirror doors tonight.  Several others also - but only since 13.7.  First time in several months.

Also chests are bugged.  Sometimes they don't close and/or dissappear.  After picking locked ones they stay open with the message that it's locked.  Tonight I've had several that did nothing until I zoned and went back into the mission.

Strycker @ 2/11/2002 3:16:04 AM (10704):
Yesterday a MP, soldier and I (NT) were hacking our
way slowly and carefully through a high difficulty mission
(all red mobs; it took all three of us to kill one, typically.) 

The mission crashed, and when we logged back in, the
soldier was on the other side of a gigantic level newly
refilled with mobs. I really should have teleported out, but
for laughs and for the poor MP's sake I tried to calm our
way out, since I don't have a team teleport yet. Didn't
work, lost 430k xp.

In a case like this it would be better to clear the level
completely and at worse sacrifice a token, or alternatively
just bring the characters back at their last save point instead
of in the middle of a swarm of red mobs. We didn't even
come back all together, which at least would have
theoretically allowed us to fight our way back out if
we'd had the patience to go back through a 50 room
corridor with a mob or two in each room.

i would have to dissagree with you. the ones that hit for 30-90 never hit for over that.

and the ones that it for 600+, hit for 600+ every time

have you been to there and experienced this for your self? you can't just assume, you have to experience it

ya, i thought it might have to do with their weapon too. but expericed the same as you.

i also thought it might be their level,  some are one more click higher, but that doesn't make a difference either. it just seems to be a random..

i'll been playing around in there collecting some unique swords (when omni's aren;t trying to kill me). and i just try to run back to stairs when i get one that hits for 600+

Kinkstaah @ 2/11/2002 5:34:08 AM (10581):
Yes I have been there, I thought thats how they went I could be wrong though, my groups generally took on many minions at once.

Ashuras @ 2/11/2002 5:35:39 AM (10704):
Honesly speaking....

This cannot be considered a BUG.

Server crashes are just like that.. server crashes. The server will not be able to save the stat of the mission zone if it's terminated abnormally. Neither will it be able to save the exact stat/location of all player within accurately too!

One possible solution would be for Funcom to put in a check such that any players that logged in at such "restarted server" zones to be placed at the 1st room instead of their last "saved" location. I'm sure this would help a lot.

I remember a LOONG time ago, when AO servers crashes all the time, the mobs will NOT aggro when a player logs on after a crash. This gives the player a chance to either prepare themselves for clear the whole place again... or runaway (a bit hard since map is wiped).

It's definitely bad if u're doing team missions with high difficulty.

Bestor @ 2/11/2002 7:05:10 AM (10704):
Ashuras did you even bother to read my post?

What happens is that the whole mission resets it self.  This never has happened to me untill the new cave style was patched in.  I have crased lots of times and or the server has done the same, however I'm just letting folks know that this new problem exists.

Am I pissed that i lost xp, yes... am I pissed that i lost the MO yes...However I would like the problem addressed and I already talked to  a GM I sent a bug report and with this post I'm letting the people of Rubi-Ka know what to expect when this happens.

vidiot @ 2/11/2002 7:26:08 AM (10581):
When i went in there 13.6 Patch day, i went in with my lvl 147 Bureaucrat Minion. Down the steps and Into some of the rooms, First room i encountered had 2 Green Minion Skeletons, me being 110. I casted area root and Mez'd one sending my pet at the other. I noticed that my pet was hitting the Sword minion for 1147 Every hit and was being hit for 675 Every hit. Then I checked my pets health and saw he was down to half health. Then my pet lost aggro and the minion turned to me and hit me twice for 675 each hit, For 3 or 4 hits, I had only 500 ac in Rad and Disease. Cuz of my crat suit, I was not wearing any other armor. I just went in there and Found the Club weilding minion hitting me for 55-200. Strange i think. But i did not have a Pet this time or was i able to see if i could get hit by the Sword weilding Skeleton Because my Internet is bad tonight and i had a 13324 Ping.

Phinger @ 2/11/2002 8:21:03 AM (First Aid Emergency Treament Kit bug. 10724):
OK this specaill kit...is made by docs.

now it needed 540 treatment to use and healed you for 2000 hp....but it blinded you till treatment lock wore off....which was fine. It helped immensely when using against Doc s who stacked dots on you and then fled. Zone to a store and heal up....

Now after 13.6/13.7 this thing requires 1001 treatment skill......even though the description says I still only need 540. So its unuseable. 

Either fix the description or reset it to the description.

Contact me in game if you want to see this

Caol @ 2/11/2002 8:58:14 AM (10581):
It's not likely that a mob that hits for 36 can get a crit for 600-1000, MiKEBOND. Either way, all that I know of that's been down there wonder about the same thing. The very same mobs excist in 2 versions. One hard-hitting and one weakling...

First Scaled Lizard I met, I killed with only dropping to 70% hp, and I thought, OMG this is easy! .. Next one hit me for 700+ every hit, blam! Respawn Terminal, hello!

Andross @ 2/11/2002 9:17:29 AM (10581):
Same here

haavarst @ 2/11/2002 10:44:31 AM (10692):
heh.. i belive you will 

I use a nano cloak +all nano armour, but whenever i exit my yalm im wearing a black trench-coat and have no gloves! I asked my friend if he could see what i was wearing and he saw me as "naked" (as if i wasnt wearing anything at all). When i zone its all back to normal.

Acidrob @ 2/11/2002 11:00:13 AM (Trading new icon bags- Needs fix soon 10736):
Today I traded one of the new icon bags with a friend to transfer to one of my other characters.
 The trade was successful, but the icon for the new type of bag (it was an implant type bag) broke after the trade. 
 This broken icon bag could be opened but not traded - so my friend had to open the bag and put all contents into a different bag to trade it back to my other char.
 Consequently I lost my new cool implant bag, and my friend ended up with a broken icon bag which he deleted im sure.

This needs to be fixed soon - im sure all new bags bought from now on will be the new icon types, and consequently traded more and more often

Acidrob @ 2/11/2002 11:03:58 AM (10674):
I have to agree - this is especially annoying when missioning and there is a mob in the 1st room. Many times I have buffed my pet outside so It would be rdy for the mob only to zone in and lose all those buffs immediately.

Acidrob @ 2/11/2002 11:08:45 AM (Broken Shores/Home - Unstable needs new scanner 10737):
I spend a lot of time in BS now Im lvl 100+. However it is the laggiest and most unstable playfield ever - I think this must be caused by the number of poeple in the zone, all congregating at the scanner. 
 Wouldnt it be great if after completing a mission I didnt have to go back into the lag/crash area to save - please add another save terminal - how about where the mission terminals are?

Acidrob @ 2/11/2002 11:15:10 AM (8658):
I have a feeling this bug is something to do with the game getting confused with wether ur sitting or standing. I had the same problem once in Mort, I couldnt heal or use rechargers - the people on my team said I was moving around while sitting down  - I was running normally on to my view. After standing and sitting down again a couple of times things started working again

glorys @ 2/11/2002 11:22:21 AM (empty treasure chests 10738):
Well, after the last tiny patch, the mission treasure chests are newbie chests. Very few have anything and when they do it is ammo. The rest are just plain empty. The locked ones NEVER have a thing in them. Will be back to play after the next patch if you have fixed them.

Oberan @ 2/11/2002 2:07:52 PM (10241):
There are no 51% missions

The mission slider is divided into 11 points (havent actually tested it fully yet). 5 before. Neutral and 5 after

Its more like 50% (even) 60%70% 80% 90% 100%

So you were doing a 60% mission which can yeild darker oranges

Inocybe @ 2/11/2002 2:12:16 PM (8925):
Undocumented in patch notes - but they have adjusted the 496 Str requirement on those Hanshi Primus helmets to the appropriate level.

Nice, now I can wear that QL110 helm 

Thanks for the fix.

TaintStain @ 2/11/2002 2:47:02 PM (10581):
IS that the same mobs that ALWAYS crits in the dungeon, ALWAYS take crit hits themself, I hit for 1.2k every 1 sec or so, and with the pet tanking they go gown fast, and my attack rating is like 350 or so and I rarely vrit leets so it has to bet crit chnce that are messed for some mobs.

Dont even bother to shoot the "unbugged minions", hit for 10-100, and they a few HP  better nuke em.

Yours

Paldorr @ 2/11/2002 4:07:22 PM (10705):
So what old bug did we re-introduce?  With the (apparant)  increased memory loss have we opened something back up that should have stayed closed?

Nikoliath @ 2/11/2002 4:38:16 PM (9910):
Yes it sucks big time .... Zone, QW drops, agro --- death. Pfft, thanks FC.... Is this intentional?

Shylara @ 2/11/2002 5:26:50 PM (Bugged Treasure Chests in Missions 10788):
I encountered this bug last night, but it seems to be repeating....

In a mission, find a locked chest.  Attempt to disarm any trap with the bomb diffuser.  No bomb, so attempt fails.  Unlock chest with lockpicks.  Chest opens.  Empty chest (usually empty anyway.)

Now, when I close the item window for the chest, the chest doesn't close.  It doesn't go away.  If I attempt to open it again, it says it is locked.  But no amount of lockpicking will open it again.  If I go find another chest and open it, I can go back to this chest and lockpick it again.

I will test this more tonight....

Miir @ 2/11/2002 5:40:33 PM (Several minor (but annoying) bugs 10790):
1) Navigation requirement for Galway map is 600.  
Other similar leveled zoned have nav reqs between 50-75. I suspect a misplaced integer. Should it be 60?


2) Biomech Armor. Are the Treatment and First Aid bonuses intended to work for Doctor profession only? My trader does not receive the bonuses. Do they work for doctors?


3) Crat nano 'Red Tape' is a AE init debuff for 30 points. This is a QL120+ nano. Is this another miplaced integer? Should it be a 300 point debuff?


4) Crat nano 'Cut Red Tape'. Buff that uses 49 NCU and raises inits by 30 points. Misplaced integer? I think a 300 point init buff is more appropriate for a QL170 nano.


5) Login client displays a message similar to: You have been disconnected. There might be a problem with the server, when you log off in the recommended fashion (sit/logoff).


6) No map exists for Wailing wastes.

Borox @ 2/11/2002 8:13:29 PM (entering game in walk mode 10821):
Anyone else getting this? Eveytime I enter the game with any of my characters, they are in walk mode. I haven't had the walk/run button in my action bar for months, and now i've had to put it back in. I have alot of things in the action bar, so I have to scroll to bar number three or higher to get back into run mode. Not a major problem, but annoying just the same

PS: now that I think about it, I don't think it happens to my level 96 fella

Nutbar03 @ 2/11/2002 8:28:30 PM (Problem with Unique special attacks 10828):
Special attacks such as Blessed with Thunder and Angel of Night can't be picked up by martial artists anymore because they are "UNIQUE".  When I try to loot one it says" You already have this unique item" because I have a different QL version in my inventory.  Putting my special attack in a bag does not solve the problem. 
This is a new problem in 13.6 (and 13.7)
Is there a reason why these attacks are unique?  

I'm stuck now, unable to improve the QL of the special attack I use unless I delete my current attack. 
I'm also unable to hold a lower QL attack in my inventory to use when I get debuffed.  Is this the intention of making these attacks unique?

Sohjiro @ 2/11/2002 8:29:05 PM (10821):
Same happens to me, but its been happening before the 13.6 patch to me. My Main character is just as I left him when I log on. My alternate character is always in walk mode.

It has something to do with you config file per character. 

Just hit backspace. It toggles running off or on.

Docgalaad @ 2/11/2002 8:53:47 PM (Bugs & Troubles Report About 13.6+ 10834):
I will edit this message with update each time i think about something...

BUGS & TROUBLES SINCE PATCH 13.6, 13.7:
---------------------------------------

- Cursor Movement Non Synchrone With Mouse Deplacement (Not seems to be Lag Dependant)
- Unlocked Chests Auto-Relock after Close
- FPS Performances have dramatically decreased (Ground Mip-Mapping very strange sometimes)
- Memory saturated by "ClientR.exe" process all the 3 or 4 outdoor playfields loaded (512 Mo RAM)
- In the same category, after log out, windows is not free from the "ClientR.exe" process during 5 minutes (99% Resources !)
- Ping is always good although we have many lock-up. More lock-up than before the last two patchs.
- Docs & NTs Nanos (Heal & Nuke) do the lower average effect, never the higher (Nerf ?!)
- Mobs do InstaKills with ChainCasting of Nukes
- Same problems with Deprives, Roots, Unmakes
- No Nanos Limits for NPC & Mobs
- Items disappeared from Inventory when we die, reappeared after an other death (sometimes never)
- Impossibility to rename organisations with colored text
- Impossibility to change the color of the Nano Contextual Messages (same green than Guild Channel)
- Some problems with the right clic on the eye of the step of madness dungeon
- Sneak mode ('H' Key) sometimes block until we zone, in my case, i can use it once by area
- Nano Kits are always bugged. They dont work when we quit a won fight (always in a fight syndrome)
- An aggroed character who decrease his Aggro-Def Slider at minimal will not be safe at all, mobs continue to aggro him instead all other members of the team who have their slider at maximal (problem with hate list management). 
- Major Bug with DNA Encode Sequencer, Docs warp the members of the team they just have leave!
- NPC Aggro Neutral Characters ! Where is the sense of beeing a neutral, even in a war period ? 
- We can loot player's cadaver again, why ?
- Character's Motion is strange when quiting a vehicule (Animation Acceleration effect)
- When using a Mid Vehicule (Probe Shape) we're strangely translucide (only from the user side)
- Clothes disappear after quiting a Yalmaha
- Return of the problem of warping back when run toward water
- Sometimes (At elmer's camp, it's the strongest) people disappear and reappear instantly nearly around
- Overflow inventory dont work in many situations (Weapon dropped 'cause no ammo, Trade Declined), object lost
- If you miss the backpack from some pixels, you put your item on the ground, when you watch for it, it has disappeared, definatly, doh !
- Use of the shop surgery clinic doesn't work twice without zoning
- Sometimes, same clan NPC attack us (Team 100% of the same clan) without have been previously provocated
- With the unbalancing state of the 13.6 patch, i consider the Mort 25%, to be a bug (FC Mind dependant). Free the crater !
- Reflect Bracelets dont work (Are you lieing in the patch notes ?)
- My Agent enters the game in walk mode. Not my two other characters, why ? Maybe make an AutoRun option. 
- All nanos casting have a new latency between the moment when we click (or press a key) and the moment when the timer bar appear (Some annoying milliseconds). It's not lag !
- Sometimes, when i picklock a door, my teammates cant through the door (Ghost door). Often after a long period in a mission area, we can be cooped up in a room with 4 ghost doors. We have to relog to exit the room.
- When you reach a grid exit without having the CL prerequisite, you might be stucked in the pyramidal structure basement (GM needed)
- During the resurrection shock period, sometimes, the first aid kit do 10% of his normal efficientness. A 100-115 HP heal kit do 10-12... strange a lot!
- Sometimes, when a MA use an ? nanos, his barlife cant reach 100% (red bargraph) on the doc team list. The doc continue to heal the MA without any reason, wasting his nanos.

OLD ISSUES:
-----------

- Always the problem of macros that randomly disappear from the action bar at each log in
- Always the bug of the Team List View with no button at all
- Always the impossibility for players to trade with us (near a booth) after purchasing an item
- When in Playful Cub shape or Panther, we cant see nothing at all. Please, move the camera or make the 3D Model completly invisible from First Person view !
- With Spike Armor Line of Nanos, i cant see the 3D World well, all these particules effect are annoying at first person. 
- On the team list, bargraphs are always wrong (after to be apart), we constantly need to refresh (F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6) them to read the real value.
- On the team list, nano bargraph is always wrong, even after a refresh. So we can see our sat teammates waiting for nano recharge although they have 100% on the screen. 

ALWAYS NEEDED:
--------------

- Need to prevent the map reset after quiting a mission area (maybe create a local data file ?)
- Need to have a shortcut for the slider (Aggro-Def), Stat View is too big
- Need to have a shortcut to fast reload both weapons
- When noone is selected, make the heal & nanos go on ourself (grrrr, so stupid to do nothing)
- More small cheap backpacks without any bonus at all (Guild Banks are always a big mess of stuff!)
- Make the pet log out with his owner. AO is unstable (sorry to deceive you FunCom), so, many relog and reboot are necessary. Build a Pet is not cheap, not easy, not fun at all when you have to relog (or have been "Link Dead") in.
- A hotkey to paste the posxy coordinates into the chat line

Pfah.  Who needs to ever walk?  When is it ever a vital part of this game that you be in walk mode instead of run mode?  ...

I've noticed that all the chars I've created fairly recently enter the game always sitting and in walk mode.  My older chars don't.

Don't be so smug. I was once explaining to a newbie that you could move your personal map around by clicking and holding on it when another player expressed surprise. Seems he had been playing the game since beta and never knew that you could move the map around.

Don't think that just because you're high level that you know absolutely everything about the game.

Benna @ 2/11/2002 9:15:51 PM (10821):

Hmm... yes the old can't heal myself wtf is going on bug.  Well, here's the fix.
While still seated, deselect yourself.  
Stand.  
Reselect yourself using F1.
Sit again and press enter and the space bar three times in rapid succession.
Press escape.
Stand again and deselect yourself
Open and close your inventory twice quickly using the keyboard shortcut.
Press enter and type /scratch.  BEFORE the scratch animation is finished type /chicken and /legshake as fast as possible.
Sit.
While holding the Alt key, press F4 twice very quickly.  
Stand up from your chair.  
Go to the fridge.
Grab a cool beverage.
Sip said beverage.
Sit back down at chair.
If clientr isn't hosed, relaunch application.
Stand.
Sit.
Select yourself by pressing F1.
Heal.
Ahh....  all better.

Am I pissed that i lost xp, yes... am I pissed that i lost the MO yes...However I would like the problem addressed and I already talked to  a GM I sent a bug report and with this post I'm letting the people of Rubi-Ka know what to expect when this happens.

Went on a slaughter fest of a bunch of the noobs. Killed my alt Myaku and like 5 other players in the immediate area. Then while I was in the virtual swamp the guard came on by and killed all the mobs over there. Freaky stuff. I hadn't started a new char in awhile, that... is that normal?

Maitrize @ 2/12/2002 2:09:23 AM (Name Bug 10889):
I don't know how big of a deal this is or if anyone knows about this but... if you go to people of rubi-ka, and do a lookup of Onigiri, you'll see my level 56 Eng on RK1, and some... one else on RK2 with the same name.

If both servers are ever merged, I think this would cause some serious problems.

Witek @ 2/12/2002 2:51:46 AM (9971):
The exact same thing was happening to me in missions. Doesn't matter the level either, happened on my 31 MA, and my 7 MP, the stupid mobs, no matter whether their an agent, or a nano-technician, start casting like some kinda fiends, over and over. It's annoying when the cast snare, or root every other second, casting more than they attack, but when it's a nuke their casting, that's flat out wrong. Let's hope they fix it soon, I'm tired of not being able to enjoy my missions.

Provisioner @ 2/12/2002 3:15:25 AM (10878):
I'm guessing that there were pets involved...I have seen guards (and guides are psuedo-guards) think that pets are the "enemy", attack them, realize the pet's master "must be" the enemy, kill him, and then say "**** it!  I'm a guard!  I'm gonna kill everything in sight!"

Great for a laugh sometimes, but really annoying after awhile (hell, when I re-roll, I get really pissed when the guards kill-steal from me!)

maybe the reason there isn't ever any responses or order to peoples question is because of the name "Anarchy Online"?

This happened to me in Mort - Im a clan Doc and had just racked up 800K in xp and was on my way back to the OP scanner to save. I carefully slipped past all the Brig- generals and thought I was safe when I saw Elmer on the Horizon - right at that moment one of the Male Sentinels decided to shoot me in the back! 
 After the rezzing and cursing blue murder I went back to the Factory and racked up another 500K xp only to have the same thing happen to me again on the way back to save.

I think there was indeed an engineer on the team, and so this might be related to the pet bug. Maybe the pet lost its affiliation at the same time the team HP buff gave its HOT sending me to the top of the aggro list..

I did petition- but got no response in the next 2 hrs I was playing..
I didnt stay on too much longer after the guard killed me the second time - somehow the fun factor was lost by that point!

Since we are discussing the basic play controls now, i want to ask 2 basic questions 

1. How can you repeat a text that you just typed in the chat window?

2. I know there is a way to change between team-chat and vicinity by typing in a special chat command. It was something like /chat v and chat /t or something like that (i knew it after the release, but i forgot the command cause i quit for some months).

DaveDread @ 2/12/2002 12:17:30 PM (MA fist on melee init?!? 10924):
Ok I've managed to reproduce this now.

My MA has 500'ish Phys Init and 120'ish Melee Init.
I used a low QL "Flurry of Blows" a few times, until I became bugged and my Melee init was at -350'ish. Phys Init was untouched (500ish) in skill window.
When attacking in this state my attack/recharge bar were moving as snails, I was hitting appx. every 4th second.

Zoning helped the issue, Melee Init went back to normal 120ish and I was swinging away at normal speed again. Phys Init never changed from original 500ish state.

So, either "Flurry of Blows" has some hidden modifyers, or it includes Phys Init without showing it in the skill window, or... MA fists run on Melee Init?

If you consider that many MA's (including me) feel a drastic loss of speed when even touching the agg/def bar away from max agg, it seems likely that MA fists run on melee init. Could someone else verify? Cz/Cosmik clarify? Or perhaps even a dev have a look at it? I mean if this IS the case it's kinda outrageous isn't it?

One wanted it, as he had almost enough flight to use it, so i closed it... Chest closed.. and locked... He was unable to open it, and so was i... Therefore a ql 200 yalm got totally lost...

On a side note I've noticed an old "bug" that have returned as well; NPCs in missions that are fighting among each other... Quite funny actually

Happens to my lvl 51 NT as well.  

Another thing that happens is if he was in run mode before entering his plane then enters an indoor playfield while still in plane mode he is in walk mode again.

Not that I am whining as I know where the backspace key is =)

Didn't know about the Shift + # to scroll the quickbar though. Thx Benna

or that Shift and Up Arrow scrolled to a previously entered message. I don't tend to repeat myself but is still handy to know. Thx foolish_child

When a mission server crashes, the entire mission resets to its last save point.  If you exit the mission, it will cause the state of the mission to be saved.

As far as I know, it has always worked that way.

You can tell when the mission server has crashed as you don't get the "do you want to reconnect to your character" dialog box when logging back in.

ARg! i could of sworn i saw a melee ring in one, but then again it could of been a gold ring.

Problem is... its Bugged  

Sometimes instead of reducing an (x) amount of damage, it actually gaines the mob that (x) amount of health to him. Its quite annoying. 

Thanks to Bgumble who pointed that out, you can find another post similiar to this on the enforcer thread. Just thought it should go here.

Sort of related to the original topic, why doesn't anyone walk? Granted, I run 90% of the time (well, I actually tool around in my kodiak most of the time), but I do a lot of walking in the cities if I'm in no particular hurry for anything. I think it does a lot to add to the atmosphere (afterall, who runs ALL the time in real life?).

Zoning is not a factor.  

Went hunting in LF, ran back to outpost and got killed by guards.

Went hunting in 4ho, ran back to outpost, and crat got aggroed and killed.  All of us had pets created in that zone.

No zoning involved in either case.

Either there is a timer involved, or some flag that gets set somehow, somewhere...

I know sometimes my pets will show up as monsters and then after a while will turn back into little white squares (omni forest)

Mekura @ 2/12/2002 9:14:21 PM (Chain casting: Problem then, problem now 11004):
k so I'm glad you guys fixed chain casting and all, but it's back.  I get through 2 rooms of a mission and am rooted, once that root wears off I'm rooted again.  I'm a doc I can stay alive for a good bit of time rooted.  So how many times did they root me, you ask? 

8 times.  They didn't even attack me.  They just sat there rooting me while their friends beat the life out of me.  But it's just roots right?  *BEEP* wrong.  I have screens full of 3 NT's casting Compressed shockwave, particle shower, and other hellish nukes all at the same time.  To say nothing of mobs healing themselves over and over again.

You fixed it once.  Fix it again.

Scorus @ 2/12/2002 10:34:43 PM (Yalms and run speed 11018):
I'm sure everyone knows that the computer doesn't count implants when deciding if you can still be in your Yalmaha when you zone. But there is an additional problem with run speed.

My run speed is normally 119 (I know, I know, I'm a crat). My Yalmaha adds +182. When I zone, I am suddenly not in my Yalm. It is still in my HUD1 slot but is red indicating not in use. My run speed at that point is 119. But when I unequip my Yalm, my run speed goes to -63! Then, when I reequip it so that I can fly again, it only goes back up to 119, not 301. 

So if I want to maintain top speed then, when approaching a zone border, I have to stop, unequip my Yalm (10 seconds, thank you Funcom), zone (which takes longer since 13.6 due to more lag), and then reequip my Yalm (10 seconds, thank you Funcom).

Why does this implant thing keep coming up? I know you aren't reverting to old code so why, on a patch when you make no changes to Yalms, does this reoccur.

Scorus @ 2/12/2002 11:11:11 PM (13.6 and LAAAAAG 11024):

Come on Funcom! This game has been out a year! You finally have got things to where I enjoy this game more then any other MMORPG...but the lag thing has been gone since UO in most RPG's, why are you reinventing it!

It does not matter to me wether I have to zone more often, or for it to takes a few more seconds to load, or even if you have to store more on my pc, but lag with my computer is ridiculous. I paid a lot of money to have the perfect gaming pc and DSL combo so that I would not worry about my charecter skipping across the screen and I would expect that you would upgrade this game to industry standard which currently is 0 lag.

ya, but why should that matter? 

there is definatelty a big difference between two versions of the same minion...

i would just like to know why there are 2 versions and which is the right one? 

if it is the ones that hit for 600-1000, than that is way too overpowering, since they are green to me...

 red brigs and generals hit me for 600 tops on a normal hit (more on a crit), mostly 300-500 ( i know they are 2 different types of mobs, one melee, the other melee and ranged). but basing the damage a borg does to the damage the hard minions do is way out of proportion based on their level (color).

and i'm not saying that is should be easy, but there are lots of mobs in there and if they attack you all at once then you better run or have a area root or calm... even if they only hit for 100.

Because RPing is the only reason anyone would ever walk.
As very very very few people RP in AO, 'nobody' seems to walk much.

And really why walk? In RL we get tired etc...in AO we don't, but we do only get so much time to play so getting from point A to point B as fast as possible is important.

Only time I ever walked was in polymorphed form, just because it looked so much better. As in the ground doesn't seem to move too fast for the model movement.

Graxxus @ 2/13/2002 12:51:35 AM (10821):
I walk all the time actually,  course I am also in sneak mode as well.  This is because I am an agent and because I'm an agent I generally rely a lot on aimed shot in order to knock as much health out of a mob before it gets to me.  Because aimed shot is restricted so heavily in usage to be beneficial agents often use walk in combination with sneak mode to slowly creep around in missions in the hopes that it will reduce our chance of being spotted.  As with everything else in this game nothing is explained well if at all.  Almost everything in the manual is just plain wrong.  I read the manual and the only thing that is explained at all that is valid is the pure basics of looking at yor gui and extremely basic communication.  

When you get a chance read the manual...you'll get a good laugh at all the errors...as well as the interesting explanations for items that have never worked "as intended".

Yep, this is happening to me too.  Sometimes, the chests don't open at all.  The only way I can open them is by zoning and then coming back to open the chest, which is a pain because the map resets.  Of course, you can't go back inside if you've already finished the mission so you lose out on whatever loot may have been available.

I have more than 1.8k hp, but I was the tank and hp bar wasn't full of coz.

Such nukes would give lower level players NO CHANCE at all

MaDezzie @ 2/13/2002 1:44:38 AM (11004):
In a mission in 20k yesterday, came across 2 skilled assassins.  Had the same root cast on me 3 times in 2 seconds, instead of the root cancelling and being reinitiated, the root stayed in my NCU and the mobs kept adding to it.  Same program ran in my NCU 3 times simultaneously.

In the same mission, met a trader.  Had siphon AC, draw AC, and divest cast on me at the same time.  In the same second, they just appeared in my NCU.

Missions are frustrating enough with all the bugs already, this insta-casting makes them worse.  FIX THIS PLEASE.

Paradox13 @ 2/13/2002 2:01:07 AM (Mysterious and Unexplainable Deaths! 11049):
Often I am fighting a weak enemy, and have plenty of HP left, and suddenly I die.  It's unexplainable.  It's happened to me at least five times so far, and I've lost over 3000 XP! (that's a lot for a level 8)

I've spoken with others and they all say this bug has been around for a while, can somebody please explain the status of the fix?

Paradox13 @ 2/13/2002 2:02:33 AM (11049):
On a similar subject (mysterious loss of HP), I sometimes lose health when I zone.  And no, I'm positive it's not lagged damage.

Only time I ever walked was in polymorphed form, just because it looked so much better. As in the ground doesn't seem to move too fast for the model movement. 
			
		
	
But in a way, aren't even the non roleplayers roleplaying at least some just by virtue of playing this game? I mean, it's escapism, no matter how you look at it or approach it. Unless you're thinking to yourself, "ok, now I'm going to take my mouse and move these pixels representing my character over to this other bunch o' pixels representing my bank to take out this bunch of pixels that are supposed to represent my armor..." all the time, then you are roleplaying, like it or not. Of course, by that definition, practically every game is a roleplaying game, but you get my point. 

Er... what were we talking about?

Yes you can move the map. It's especially nice if you have a mission in a city because you can move the map around and find out what part of the city the mission is in.

I found it out purely by accident, I was trying to find out the coordinates of my location by clicking on the map and held the click a little too long. (And yes, I know about PF9 giving you coordinates, I just didn't know it THEN).

luxferro @ 2/13/2002 5:55:52 AM (Attacked by NONE 11066):
Is anyone aware of this bug?

When you are pulling a mob and he runs the wrong direction or you run to fast and loose line of sight of him and get the "Attacked by NONE" message.

Then when he finally catches up to you, and starts to kick yours or your teamates ass, you can not attack him.

you then get the "Wait for previous battle to end" message (don't quote that word for word, i forget the exact phrase).

Anyway, is this gonna be fixed.. i know it happens to other people besides me, happens alot, especially at NW crater in Mort.

Loretta @ 2/13/2002 8:43:15 AM (10704):
Umm, how long does this server crash last for?

I've been playing the game for a while.  This started happening since the last patch:

- The entire team crashes
- We relog into the game 30 seconds later
- The mission is reset; all the mobs are back

Is this what you guys mean by server crash?  It's an awfully quick crash.

Problematic if I just cleared 95% of the mission.

I walk sometime cause I the world moves too fast otherwise - not!

Anyway does anyone ever want to create a reference of a place and store it as knowledge?  You can do this for people and objects... next.. places   I mean how many times have you found a good hunting ground then forgot how to get back there..

I bet someone is going to tell me you can now.

Koradril @ 2/13/2002 4:03:27 PM (11004):
I think thats exactly the problem. The program stays in your NCU, even after the caster dies, and just keeps doing damage. Im only level 26, so Accelerated titanium pellet is the bane of my existance  When it hits me once, its bad enough. But when it stays in my NCU and hits me another 3-4 times, in addition to other programs doing the same, AND the casters standing there and shooting me while im hit by their nanos that shouldn't be hitting anymore, and im in serious trouble.

Now, I like this game, but im not gonna pay to be cheated out of hours of earned xp by a stupid BS bug. Fix this, and do it fast, or you will lose even more subscribers.

Cardos @ 2/13/2002 4:07:44 PM (10821):
I remember reading the game manual and it said that you could make references of the map, never been able to do it though!

Would be damn useful, especially if you could do the right click and get a compass pointer to the location like you can with missions.

(knowing my luck, this bit of the manual has now been changed to make me look a complete ass)

Bump

I have high B&E (strange for an enforcer I know) but I am usually the only one in my group that can open 170+ chests.

Sucks when there is a high level Shen in there and my MA friends can't get them.  I just don't bother telling them what they are missing, it's too depressing for them.

Arinia @ 2/13/2002 6:18:37 PM (10834):
Please be sure to note that under the 


	
		
			
			
				- Mobs do InstaKills with ChainCasting of Nukes 
- Same problems with Deprives, Roots, Unmakes
			
		
	
you write:

Working on them. Tweaking, and removing the heavy nukes from the NPC nano lists. "

Please note that only removing the big nukes will not solve the problems. It just seems like you didn't mention the chain casting part in the fix 

First of all, it doesn't matter whether you get hit for 8k or for 4x 2k nukes one after another, you are still dead in 10 seconds 

Also, chain roots make blitzing missions effectively impossible.  You broke blitzing before with the "must not be in a fight thing" a few patches back, and you promptly removed it due to player protest.

Same thing here.  Removing mission blitzing from the game is a show-stopper.


BTW:  It isn't said much but you are doing a really good job of keeping the player base informed of bugs in this patch.  THANK YOU.  I hope you won't take these clarifications the wrong way.  The fact that I'm posting just shows that I care  -- and I'm sure you have a lot of other players who feel the same way.

As a tank I use 3rd person to gain a birds eye view of the battle field.   It allows me to see adds incoming long before the start to pounding on my doctor.  As well I can see if my doctor is getting pounded.   All in all 3rd person allows me to better manage my encounters while in a group so that I can spread my tuanting out more effectively.


This bug in not a new bug but it is starting to get on my nerves and has cost the life of many of docs in my groups.   When in 3rd person and paning around the camera will zoom out ..... all the way out for no reason.   When I say zoom out I mean ALLLL the way out ...to the end of the play field I am in sometimes.

Ashuras @ 2/14/2002 2:07:54 AM (11004):
I think chain casting is only one of the problems.

Another related one is that the casting by NPCs is almost INSTANTANEOUS.

I've never been rooted while pulling.. happened to me for the 1st time last nite.

Was really amazed.. it's such a short distance and I have really good run speed. Got rooted almost immediately after I saw the "attacked by" message.

MaDezzie @ 2/14/2002 4:54:27 AM (11061):
There are at least two ways of the insta-death bug occuring, that I'm aware of.

1.  Starting attack failed....
Starting attack failed....
When you see that message start to spam your chat, heal as fast as you can.  If you're playing solo, get to a zone, use a first aid stim, just heal, because in a matter of seconds, your HP could be down to nothing.  If you're teamed yell at the team to start healing ASAP.  Death is sometimes preventable in this case.. but if you're a class with poor body dev, this one might get you all the time.

Here's how it happens:  Teammate A attacks mob.. you start beating on mob..  right before the mob dies, he aggros you, but doesn't get a hit in yet..  Starting attack failed shows up on your chat.. 3 seconds later your health PLUMMETS.  I've dropped from 4200 HP to 1200 HP in 3 seconds, with no you were hit for *** amount of damage messages.  Why?  Oh, that's right, the mob was already dead.

I'm lucky, I play a tank class, so I have a lot of HP, but to those NT's, MP's, Docs, etc, this would mean death. 

2.  Attacked by -NONE-
This happens if you're aggroed by a mob, and you run out of the mob's range, or if the mob runs out of your range.  If it happens in a mission, just zone as fast as you can.  Why?  Well, chances are that mob got stuck on a wall somewhere, yet, he's still hitting you, even though you can't see him, or the damage you're taking.  If it happens while you're team hunting outdoors, make sure the healer on your team starts healing, otherwise you could drop dead without a moment's notice.

The attacked by -NONE- has been around since I started playing back in September.  This starting attack failed I first noticed around 13.0 I believe.  FC there is no excuse for either of these bugs that can be very devastating to a character.  And I'm highly shocked that they haven't been made a priority on your 'fix' list.  Find some way to fix these, or start returning people's lost XP back to them, and quit being lazy.

Oh, and on an added note, fix the stability of the mission zone servers.  Yesterday, my full team of 6 was in a mission.  We practically cleared the entire playfield, then bam, our zone crashed.  I log back in to find a Veteran Trader, Veteran Marksman, and a Veteran MP on my tail.  I'm all alone, and I'm stuck inside a room with a locked door that I can't open because I'm under attack.  So no I couldn't even attempt to get out, I had to stand there and wait to die, and watch my 1.5 million XP go down the drain.  The entire mission had reset, didn't save anything we'd done, yet it saved our location and dropped us right where we last stood, resulting in over 10 million in XP loss from my entire team.

I'm trying very hard to be patient with the bugs and the once a month (somtimes less frequent) patches that seem to introduce even more bugs and imbalances.  But, when every other minute you hear a teammate or a friend say, I'm bugged again, I need to zone again, god I wish FC would fix this..  you start to get a little less patient and get less hopeful that the company we pay to play this game isn't doing their intended job.  Make these things right, or you will lose a lot of players when new sci-fi MMORPG's come out on the market.

FireC @ 2/14/2002 4:55:49 AM (11004):
Yes the chain casting problem is very bad. I think I completely  missed it last time so this is the first time I've actually seen how it is. NTs are absolutely lethal if I'm not playing a character who can heal herself. Weirdest thing was though when I was lagging badly while I was being attacked by two agents - when things started moving again my NCU showed me I had pretty "interesting" set of nanos running. From top down I had 4 roots, then 4 DoTs and 4 roots again. And yes they all stayed on me until their time ran out...

The "so-called" bug is the lag latency between the server and the client, Funcom is highly aware of the problem, but has not really a solution to it as many of the players live in USA and ... are actually playing on modems. 

If you are playing over a modem, sorry, but then you have no one else to blame than yourself.

MaDezzie @ 2/14/2002 8:34:49 AM (11049):
'If you are playing over a modem, sorry, but then you have no one else to blame than yourself.'

Funcom has the minimum requirements posted on their site, and apparantly a dial-up modem is supposed to work just fine.  And these client/server latencies you speak of..  I've got news for you, they happen with any connection, whether it be DSL, cable, whatever.  So who's to blame, really?  The customer for having above and beyond these minimum requirements?  Or Funcom for having unstable and overcrowded servers?

Mymir01 @ 2/14/2002 12:00:04 PM (Due to a Mission Bug, I am now Clan. 11230):
I chose a Mission to Greater Omni Forest last night.

The item I was to find and retrieve was a Clan acceptance form.

I found the form and picked it up.

All of a sudden, I get a Clan Token Board in my inventory.

I thought it a bug so I continued the Mission.

The next thing that I know, I cannot TAB any of the NPCs in the Mission.

Another bug, I thought.

I leave the Mission and notice when I look at my Equipment that my Token Board (60 tokens) is shaded in red.

I target myself and hit the "t" key and am surprised to find that I am now a Clan member.


That is not the greatest of my worries.



I petition about it and am told that I have 64 petitions in front of me.  So I wait.  And wait.  And wait.

4 hours later.


The list in the queue gets down to 3 petitions in front of me and then, suddenly, I have no petition in the queue.

I re-petition and am told that there are now 54 persons in front of me.

 
I need to know if there is a possibility of fixing this mistake.


I will remain camped at the Mission spot and try to get an answer to another Petition when I get the chance.


What I am asking here is if it is possible to be restored to a previous Save.

I do not care about the items or money or experience that I will lose from this.  

I just do not wish to have to start all over with an empty Merit board at 38th.


Please respond if there is a way to fix this.


The character name is Mymir.  Same as my Alias here.

Mymir01 @ 2/14/2002 12:05:10 PM (11230):
Adn before anyone ask:

Lag and latency are network issues in general, though server overload cannot be ruled out. I obviously don't know the details of Funcom's setup but would expect latencies from server load to rarely be a major issue except in the cities. Latencies in the network could be occuring anywhere from Funcom's LAN to you ISP's LAN and all points in between. I play on a cable modem, and do get latency spikes, but usually, latencies are fairly low. Its very easy to blame Funcom for everything (hey, you try running AO!), but in many cases I suspect your problems are entirely beyond FCs control (I'm not saying they all are mind you...)

I had this happen once, but what happened was I had clicked on the form to "use it" while the form was sitting on the ground.  This could easily happen when trying to pick up the form.

I suggested then that Funcom should consider adding a confirmation dialog prior to your character actually switching alignments.

Just picking up the form shouldn't be enough to switch your characters alignment

Does anyone else get weird graphic glitches when using a "Night Vision" device or nano (like a low light scope or Playful Cub)? 

When I use these I can see through the landscape.. it makes everything look like it is suspended in air.. I can "kinda" see through hills and mountains. If it didnt make me feel like I was on prescription drugs I would use it all the time so I could see mobs behind topographic features.. But it hurts my head.

Overcrowded servers because more than X procentage of the player database obviously plays over modem. Despite what Funcom says, I recall it was clearly stated on the Half-Life (Counter-Strike) box that 28.8 modems works without a problem. Well, just exactly how many plays CS or whatever on a modem unless they actually believe that it works (it does, but then again they can hardly blame Funcom for the lag they may encounter) well.

And overcrowded servers is not Funcoms fault. It is due to the fact that AO is popular despite all its problems.

2) Biomech Armor. Are the Treatment and First Aid bonuses intended to work for Doctor profession only? My trader does not receive the bonuses. Do they work for doctors?

Last I heard that bonuses didn't work properly for Doctors either.


6) No map exists for Wailing Wastes. 

I think it might be part of the Aegean map.  Last time I checked, the Aegean map supposedly contained the Omni-HQ map which doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense.

On a side note, Omni players don't get the Omni-HQ map from the Startup Maps - Omni-Tek.

I think might be because they encoded the value wrong.  They are treating -1 as being equal to 1.  Specifically, 0x80000000 == 0x00000001.

This is the same problem with the Map - 4 Holes and Map - Dry Wastes.  Both maps give the same map, so I think the Dry Wastes was supposed to be encoded with 1 and not a -1.

Doesn't make a whole lot of sense that there would be two maps for 4 Holes with different names.

Angeleye @ 2/14/2002 4:45:29 PM (10241):
Pull the slider to full green and you're doing in theory a 0% difficulty mission and pull the slider to full red and you're doing a 100% difficulty mission.

This means that when you first choose a mission the difficulty is 50% (the slider is in the middle) and by clicking on the slider (not dragging it) the next step would be - in theory - 51%. I think this is what Hobbes meant...

The point that I am trying to make here is that I did not right click on the Clan Form while it was in my inventory.


I did however Right-click on it while it was on the ground to target it so that I could pick it up.


Secondly, there was no Confirmation/Decline screen to make sure that I intended to change sides.

Thirdly,  There was no notification that I had indeed changed sides.


The only way that I found out I had become Clan was when I targetted myself and hit the T key to examine myself.


I shudder to think what might have happened if I had died and re-spawned in Omni-Trade.

Or worse,  I had run back to Omni-1 not knowing that the first Guard or Omni NPC that I met would KOS me.


This is a very dangerous item to be using in Missions as a "Get this for this" item.

I would request that it be either taken out of the Mission Terminals or, at the very least, that a Confirmation Box be used to Accept/Decline to prevent what has happened to me from EVER happening to another person.

I've noticed the same problem in dungeons and outdoors. I was always able to re-create the problem when fighting Borgs in Avalon - panning around in 3rd person it would always zoom out into the corner of the 1st building on the right - happened everytime in the same spot.
Pain in the ass when it zooms the whole playfield away - takes a few secs to zoom back in again, and as a Doc I could have lost someone in that time.

Mymir01 @ 2/14/2002 8:51:46 PM (11230):
Thanks to the understanding of a GM and a total of 10 hours of waiting, I am now Omni once again.



I am still requesting that either a Confirmation Box be added for when you click on an Alignment-changing Form. 


Or at the very least, remove those forms from the Mission Terminals.


As an item that is required to complete a Mission these things are far too dangerous.


The very fact that you can click on it while it is still on the Ground is reason enough to remove them from the Terminals.


Nothing else that I have come across in this game will allow you to use it without it being in your Inventory.



I will continue to try and get this changed for as long as I can.


No one should have to go through the mess that I have had to deal with for the past 2 days.

Acidrob @ 2/14/2002 9:09:15 PM (Team Loot = all again 11308):
How many times does the team leader have to reset the damn looting rights to alpha! It seems that everytime the team leader zones into a mission the looting rights are reset to all. 
Please fix this, and while your at it make alpha loot the default - who uses loot = all anyway???

Paradox13 @ 2/14/2002 9:19:22 PM (11049):
I have cable.

If I am on cable, have 150 health left, and the green enemy I am facing never hits more than 5 damage, how am I supposed to blame this on lag?

Krigaren @ 2/15/2002 3:23:30 AM (Teleporting 11355):
I found a teleporting bug in newland desert. I zoned in the NE corner at ground level and faced serveral reds so I went back and tried going over the big mountain to zone on the other side. But that was a no go borderzone. I went back to zone again only this time I zoned a bit up the mountainside. Where it was really steep. I ended up in the NW corner of newland desert and earsnest wasteland or whatever it was called. On the other side of the entire zone. I zoned back and was still in the NW part. So I went up the mountainside again and zoned and ended up exiting in the middle of newland desert. Halfway back where is started. This just has to be a wrap around bug in the zoning system..

Krigaren @ 2/15/2002 3:26:54 AM (11308):
When hunting in high body count areas like shades in PM the combat personell havent got time to relax and loot...only he support staff do. Hence all is easier. Set it to leader if you wanna get rid of some group members..

Kikdabucket @ 2/15/2002 3:37:17 AM (11049):
In the same zone now twice in the last 3 days I've been in a team with someone who has just died for no reason at all.

The first one was an NT, the one last night an Adventurer.  They're not low on health, being attacked or anything.  To both them and to us they appear to be at full health.  We were recently fighting a mob, but that has been finished for about 30 seconds.  And then... just for no reason at all.... they're dead.  And in both cases it wasn't like "oh yeah I thought that might happen" it was... "WTF!?!?!".  The NT at the time was refreshing their Layer Protection, the Adventurer was doing nothing except get ready for next fight..

Anyone else had this?

NeoXero @ 2/15/2002 1:50:38 PM (Im Stuck and cant move (EVER) 11418):
i was in a mission and i went in a room with another door, beyond that door is a small room with a orange animation of light constanylt moving from one side to another. well i went in this room and now im stuck in it, no matter how hard i try to get out of the origonal door i cant. there seems to be some sort of invisible wall making it so i cant get out. my charactor will be stuck in this place at least untill someone fixes this problem and there for spinding away the money i payed to play this game, yet i cant play. PLEASE FIX IT, i rilly dont wanna have to start a new charactor after all the time iv put into this one.

WGMelchior @ 2/15/2002 2:01:05 PM (11418):
You can do 3 things right now:


1: Type '/petition Help! I'm stuck in a mission.' and wait for someone to get you out of there. Might take a while though.

2: Wait until the mission time ends (8 or so hours from the time you requested it) and logoff and logon. You should end up outside the mission.

3: Type '/terminate' and lose all unsaved XP. You will end up next to a reclaim terminal.

Mangoslurpy @ 2/15/2002 2:59:52 PM (11049):
are you on rk1? i wonder if this is a rubi-ka 1 only problem. i'm on rk2, neither my buddies or myself has ever experienced this bug.

Sandfox @ 2/15/2002 3:31:40 PM (Treatment Kits 11426):
Has anyone else noticed that you can't use Treatment Kits because the game says your still being attacked even though they can't hit you or see you? 

I've rooted the mob and run like 7 rooms away and sat down but it says I can't use the kit cause I'm in a fight. What use is root if you can't get away to heal up? 

The mob can't see me, it can't attack me from where it is, why can't i sit down, use the kit to get in a quick heal, stand back up and go back and find him?

Sandfox @ 2/15/2002 3:34:36 PM (11308):
our group uses all most of the time. We tried alpha in steps and Foreman's Office, BIG mistake. Too many mobs, you can't tell which is the one you can loot and people end up leaving mobs just laying there as more attack.

Fixing the setting so it sticks when you zone or add new people would be great, but please don't make it sound like no one uses "All" or that everyone wants the default changed. Just because you don't use it doesn't mean no one uses it.

Sandfox @ 2/15/2002 3:50:58 PM (10821):
You can also rearrange the panels if you don't like the order they are in. I don't think they save when you camp and come back though, same as your buttons in the action panel :-(. would it be so hard to have them in a config file so when you come back into the game, your aimed shot or fast attack button were in the same place? They did it for the hotkey bar....

Anyways, the panels on the right, say you want the little map at the top so when you open other panels it doesnt go down where you can't see it. Just click and hold on the top of the panel you want to move and move it I think a red line appears between the panels as you move it up or down and when you get to where you want the panel to be, just let the mouse go (drag and drop).

xenomorph @ 2/15/2002 4:47:57 PM (11308):
Don't give them any ideas on removeing team loot all, you need that if to say your team is in a dungean and the boss mob drops a no drop item, you want loot set to all so the person in your team that needs that item can loot the body, if it is set to alpha then guess what youll have to camp until the loot comes around to them agian, get my point.

damage stacking is alot worse recently, i have had alot of cases of damage stacking in the last few weeks where i dont record damage or a team mate just falls over after a fight in which he was healing another team member from afar and after the fight we are just talking and he flops over dead.

vespucci @ 2/15/2002 8:54:07 PM (Not sure if this is a bug - Hacked Symbiot Sparrow's Flight 11467):
I find that this device works very unreliably.  Half the time it works and half the time it does not.

I think this is a bug, but I'm not sure.

Anybody else have any experience with this?

It's pretty bad when my NT is in South Clon**** which has very nasty monsters roaming around and I find that my sparrow flight symbiot does not work which means I have to wait 30 minutes before I can try it again.

30 Minutes!!!!!

By then my poor NT will be in the digestive tract of some Offal Larva and the only 30 minutes its going to be concerned about are the 30 minutes it has to wait after eating before it can go swimming.

Anyway, let me know if you have any experience with this device.

Paldorr @ 2/15/2002 9:31:36 PM (13.8 - Anyone have an AOMD version that works?.. 11471):
Mine works on live RK1 with 13.7 but not on Test with 13.8.

Bionitrous @ 2/15/2002 10:02:39 PM (11467):
I'd like to know this as well.  Sometimes my character just waves his hands in the air and nothing happens.  No message of failure, no nothing.  If the graft is going to work properly, you see the attack/recharge bar fill up and empty.  You know instantly that the bug is going to kick in because you don't see the bar appear at all.

I thought these were supposed to be fixed in 13.7.

Funny thing I've noticed is that the graft seems to work reliably in certain playfields.  For instance, if I grid into West Athen take two steps left then two steps forward, I don't think I recall a single instance where it hasn't worked.

And while we're on the subject of playfields, has anyone noticed that some playfields will never let you get the 'soaring' effect while in reet form and others will?  In West Athen I can jump all I want while in Reet form and still have to deal with the 'wing flapping' nonsense.  But if I zone into Athen Shire, all I have to do is tap the space bar to jump and I'm comfortably in 'soar' mode while en route.

grimmolly @ 2/16/2002 4:27:13 AM (Engineer Pets Get Permanently Rooted When Zoning 11513):
This must have some attention because of the new patch coming up.

I noticed the other day that if i zone while my bot is rooted, I can no longer see the effects of the root, but he is still rooted.  No doubt this is related to the other issue of losing buffs when zoning.  However, he never comes unrooted.  I waited for an hour while my team went on to other things.

The issue occured again later and I managed eventually to get my pet free by drawing a mob to it which rooted the pet and then did damage to break the root.  Otherwise, I would have had to term my pet.  This becomes worse in the next patch because damage won't break the root during a fight and engies have no nanos like doctors do to break roots.  Please consider adding such a nano to break ill effects on bots.

vespucci @ 2/16/2002 7:03:01 AM (11196):

I've ahd this happen about a dozen times now, jsut at random really, no place or action in particular seems to trigger it. It's kinda fun the first tiem seeing basically the whole zone but when you get to spend 30 seconds zooming back in in the middle of a battle it's gets very annoying, very fast.

I just bought the game, and finished patching it, and after 3 hours I started it up.  I start my game and I am in the breed selection room and I can't choose a breed.  I click on opifex female and it turns me into a solitus male, i click on nano male it works, but for some reason it doosn't say I am a male.  All the other breeds I get the message I am not close enough to the machine, I am practically f***ing the g***amned machine!  Hey Funcomm I thought the bugs were fixed, I guess not you just lost about 5 subscribers(my friends and I).

Laeni @ 2/17/2002 1:56:25 AM (11585):
I have never heard of this bug before. There's a good chance that your post is the first that Funcom has heard of it as well. Instead of getting all bent out of shape, why don't you send an e-mail to support@funcom.com describe what happened and ask them if this is a bug or if they could help you resolve it.

They really aren't doing this deliberately just to upset you.

darkphoenix @ 2/17/2002 4:38:10 AM (11585):
yeah I know, I just got a little upset.  It's pretty aggrivating to have to install updates for 3 hours (and yes I have DSL) and then have the game still not work.  I sent support an email, hopefully they'll be able to figure it out.

Sandfox @ 2/17/2002 8:31:17 AM (11024):
Yes, I've had the same problem. I was wondering if others were encountering the same thing. I have constant minor freezes every few seconds while running. If a monster moves up to attack I freeze up. I had to turn my gun effects and nano effects off to not freeze as much. I didn't have these problems prior to the patch.

Wheelie @ 2/17/2002 10:38:17 AM (9259):
I'm 29lvl Fixer and I was thinking about making my
own weapons by myself. I was doing this just for
fun, exp and because it should be possible.

Now I have all parts for about 35ql Mausser Particle
Streamer and I have wasted 11k credits for nothing.
I don't have any 100+lvl friends who could give me
100k cr just like that if I want to buy something new
and I only play few hours a week just for fun.

I spent those few hours to get some money and find
right parts for better weapon and now it doesn't work.  :-(

Now I know almost all Weapon Contructions Kits are
broken, but what do I do with my Fixer now? I have
used lots of skill pts to weapon smith and other trade
skills.

I hope that people in FunCom start to fix bugs first and
make new features after that.

Misophist @ 2/17/2002 5:15:55 PM (11024):
Yes, me too. Graphics were like butter prior to this patch. I run everything in highest settings turned up at 1024x768x32 because of a tiny monitor, and this produced no lag at all with the occasional hiccup in Omni Trade or other crowded areas.

Now I'm thinking of going back to medium settings. The graphics are hardly as smooth and flowing now, which could probably be solved by lower settings. But the game looks sooo nice with all the visual bells and whistles.

Biffstatsnugly @ 2/17/2002 8:37:23 PM (Perma rooted while mission running. 11657):
Ok just thought i would post a problem i had afew days ago. Was running some missions and on the last one i entered the first room with my bot and was ganked by 3 agent mob's. So i turn and run for the door. I am rooted as i hit the door and then see the message chaning playfields. I was very happy about that since i would have been dead for certain. Only problem is that when i zone i am rooted and the root is not in my ncu? I didnt even have time to buff so i had nothing else running. I could not move, cast, or nothing. So i just had to sit there and petition. I ended up with like 85 petitions ahead of me or something really obscene. My choices where to terminate and lose the xp or wait so i waited, awhile and just when i figured i was getting nowhere quit along came a spider who thankfully attacked me, and the root broke as soon as i returned fire. 


Just thought i would post that you can still get perma rooted and to let someone know if anyone even reads over the bug boards.

Iyse @ 2/17/2002 11:55:18 PM (Unable to target with TAB or Q 11680):
2 problems I've noticed this weekend:

in my last mission (Sun GMT 10pm'ish) I was unable to target anyone using TAB, and Q didn't seem to work either. Luckily it was a relatively easy mission, but this is not good! Was this just a one-off? Or has anyone else had this problem?

Also, another character had a large backpack in her inventory on Tuesday. When I logged in yesterday, it was no longer there (along with the various contents of that pack). Expensive item for a level 12 character to lose. Any chance of this being returned?

Grateful for help.

Loretta @ 2/18/2002 4:35:12 AM (Lost items and Funcom's Followups 11702):
Well, I lost ql 176 tank armor and 2x169+1 189 NCUs in trade crash

After relogging I did find, however an extra ql 200 tank armor in my bag.  I have no need for that tank, since I have another one that quality.

I sent a petition, waited for 2 hours.  Did pet status, saw 3 people ahead of me.

Did petition status a few minutes later, it told me I have no petitions.

No one showed up.

Ok, so now there are 2 things I hate to cope with:

1.  The issue of lost items.  These are hard to replace, but not impossible.  I could roll another set of items.  It's a waste of time though, as I could be doing missions for other things.

2.  The issue of customer support.  

I can understand if someone came down and told me that it is company policy not to replace items lost due to programming errors.   I had mixed results with getting lost items back.  I think that deleting anyone's petition from the queue without even answering it, however, shows lack of respect for a player.  I'm angry right now, and this made me even angrier.  I've lost a yalmaha before, somehow got over this.  But I'm getting tired of being gullible and just going with the flow.

MuscularBeaver @ 2/18/2002 6:44:59 AM (11657):
That happened to me once, too.  (Only once, fortunately.)  I don't remember if /quit fixed it or if I had to /terminate, but nothing else would work, and no monsters were around to pick a fight with me to cancel the root.

eliziaengy @ 2/18/2002 7:09:19 AM (10704):
I have had my missions respawning not only from a server crash but just from merely zoning out to heal or to save! And yes, I have been wiped out three times after the server crashed and I logged back on inside a room full of angry mobs.This started after the new mission patch. I really really hope Funcom can fix this somehow! I like to do missions mostly but I might need to play "outside" for awhile.......

eliziaengy @ 2/18/2002 7:26:45 AM (9971):
Total truth: I was chain casted 9 roots in a row. 

I was calling them out as they happened to my husband in the other room, he thought I must be kidding.

Also, somehow the green npc nanoguns can take out half my health with one nano, two, I'm pretty much cooked,when they cast one after another, guess what happens?The worst is when fear is chain casted on my 'bot, there is no way to fight such an npc,I just had to delete the mission, and the prize was a very rare nano I spent forever at the terminal to find.

These all have been happening with the new patch.

Angeleye @ 2/18/2002 9:43:20 AM (11467):
Whilst not stated in the desc, all items that are hacked are more unstable. Which means that the exeuction of the hacked item might fail...

Edit: When hacking for example Blister Packs, the desc clearly states that they are more unstable. And they do fail to execute from time to time.

runey @ 2/18/2002 10:53:48 AM (11657):
I had it too. Luckily, it only took an hour (!) to get an ARK to get a GM to let me out. Turns out the solution is to get someone to cast another root on you and let *that* root wear off. The only reason I needed a GM in that case was because the ARK didn't happen to be a class with a root nano, so he couldn't help. Nice fellow though.

Letah @ 2/18/2002 10:59:14 AM (11702):
I hear you Carrah.

I had that 2 times as well, Last time I petionned was because I could not get those new defl. shield working (I got the needed parry skill but it says the item is not used in the proper manner, erm ok.. how do I?). I also noticed my character went from small heigth - medium width to small width.

So I petionned, being maybe a tad too jolly:

/petition Hi, today I logged on and saw my character looks like she didnt eat for 3 days, I also require your assistance using an item I have the reqs for, but doesnt seem to work

Thats what I sent. 30 pets in front. 2 hrs later: 3. 15 mins later: you have no active petition. I never went afk nor did I miss a tell (I squelshed all but the area and guildchat). What the -cencored- did the ark/gm think to just delete my pet? If he/she did not then there's something broken with their system 

They also are inconsistent with their set of rules I might add. A few months ago a friend got killed due to lag and had his lost xp re-added by the gm. Okay, fair to me. A month ago I lost xp while zoning, did not tele to respawn-pad and was in res, standing there in the jungle. Petitioning resulted in being tped to the pad, but no way the GM said I would get my exp back. Saying my friend did get his back a while ago resulted in a 'that is not allowed to us, he mustve been lucky'. Dont get me wrong, the GM was very nice and polite, but comon, lucky?! If I want support I dont want LUCK to be a factor of service!

It gets even worse: since I died I asked the GM if I also lost a pvp point. "We cant see pvp points". Uh right I said, thats why in the past an other GM told me I was near freshman, less then 1 killaway? "He was not allowed to, nor would I know how to do that". herm okay.. next time Ill petition away till I get my old GM back who DID tell me my pvp points..

Since people do not believe others at their word always please check this screeny where i got told my pvp position:
http://www.fnemesis.com/ao/gm.jpg

I EVEN got /telled by Funcom personnel in both IRC and AO not to conversate these things "as they might be misinterpreted as actions of favourism from gms towards players". I _did_ kept silent about it, but seeing more people had these weird customer support I really can't be bothered not to share this. I do not feel I'm special nor would, you, reader should think I am. Hey, I only am "lucky!", maybe you will have your luck in a petition-session..

WTB Customer-support luck items, will pay well

"wtf do you want?" might a FC reader think? Go freaking sit around the table with the GM, heck even might add the ARK's to it and WRITE down what you can and not can ffs! Im tired of seeing people get something done with GM #1 and get a 'no way!' from GM #2! As all customer support companies have (i work at one), create a set of COMPLETE rules and make your workforce obey those! I dont know about your 'rules' but when I notice my collegue made an (even illegal) exception with a client I DONT tell my client he can go f*** himself because its not legal. I help him just as well as my collegue did. I DO tell my collegue he was out of order though!

A kinda annoyed Letah.

Shift+R replies to the last person who gave you a tell.
Shift+R + Up arrow scrolls the list of people who told to you.

You can upload missions to the world map directly from the mission terminal.  Just hit P to see exactly where those missions are.

!cc addbuddy <name> adds any persons name to your friends list.  Even offline ones.

!cc rembuddy <name> removes a person from your friends list

!cc rembuddy ?    removes ALL people under the ? in the friends list. (I LOVE this one).

/played is a fun command....tells you how long you have been playing your character on your current side (omni/clan/neutral), it resets when you change alignment.

You can move your hotkey bar to vertical (instead of the default horizontal)...I 'think' its CTRL + LEFT click on the tab on the left of it.

CTRL+ALT+F  shows your current Frames Per Second in the upper left side of your screen.

Malakie @ 2/18/2002 2:18:06 PM (comprehensive bug list REPRODUCABLE! 11748):
Hi, enclosed is a bug list that I have been compiling.  I have been able to reproduce these bugs and in some cases they are having a MAJOR affect on gameplay which has caused quite a bit of loss for me in the last few days.

Feel free to comment or send me question on any bugs I have listed here.

1)  Charm/Calm nano in group bug - This bug is real nasty.  When grouped, we have found that all of us using BOTS end up loosing total control of our bots when another in the group casts charm nanos or sometimes calm nanos.  This bug has cost me over 350K in exp personally in last day or two.   Once the caster does this, the bots will not respond to any command or if they do, it happens 2 minutes later and is usually not the command you gave.  In some cases we have witnessed the bots attacking party members.

This bug IS totally reproducable.  They are NOT casting on the bots.  They are casting on creatures we are fighting.  We have also been able to figure out that if the member that casts charm, leaves the group then suddenly bot control is returned to those of us using bots.   This bug also seems to cause other problems almost like you are having a lag issue yet our pings are fine.   And again once the person who casts charm leaves the group, instant return to full control and normal operations.

2)  Playing along, again in a group, and fighting creatures.  Suddenly party members start dying suddenly.  They go from full health to dead in 1 sec.  Unable to ascertain direct cause but no lag or connect problems are apparent at the time.  This appears to happen much more when something like a second Lifebleeder suddenly appears right after you just killed one.  That does seem to be a common factor.

3)  Backpacks, bags - these loose organization after zoning or dying.  I like to organize things in my bags in a certain way for access... like gem cutters, lockpicks and such.  But everytime I zone my bags internal organization gets all messed up and I have to move things around again.

4)  shoulder boards and tokens - After right clicking on shoulder boards, they appear nicely in view over your character.  Plus you get bonuses for tokens you have.  However after dying or zoning, everytime in fact, the visual of the boards goes away as does the effects of the bonuses.  You have to right click on the boards after each zone to get them to appear again and to get the bonues.  BTW we do like the fact they appear.. Nice to show off rank to everyone visually.

5)  Casting bots nano -  I am an engineer.  I recently bought a bot that said I needed Matmet of 258 and TimeSpace of 258.  No prob, I had exactly that IP for both since I just leveled and was able to buff myself to reach exactly that number.  Buy the new bot nano.  Cast the new bot nano and it appears in backpack.  Great I think.  Bt wait, what's this?  I now need a 265 in each to activate the bot!

That's the bug.  The nano says it needs a certain IP yet after you cast the nano, the bot activation icon that appears in your backpack now says it requires a HIGHER nano that what the nano spell says.

6)  Recommendation -  Through lots of trial and error, I have determined that users who have video cards that support anistropic and mipmaps need to turn them OFF completely to get rid of certain problems running the game or to remove certain visual artifacts.   I suggest you post somewhere this information.  I went from a 50% stability in the client to 100% client stability once I figured this out.  Anistropic filtering needs to be trilinear and mipmapping needs to be off.  I am running a Gforce 3 card BTW.

7)  Shoot through walls, bot gets stuck and more in missions -  I ended up so angry that for the last week I refuse to do missions.   Repeatedly I find that enemies, once I am targeted, can shoot me through walls.. even when I am 6 or seven rooms away.  Additionally, the bot I use gets easily stuck in walls or runs around away from where I tell it to go.

8) Mission room that bots cannot negotiate - There is one room in particular that bots cannot handle - ever.  The room is a small square room with a large 'L' shaped desk and chair in it.  No matter what mission or how you try, bots cannot and will not negotiate this room and in most cases end up stuck in there - stuck enough you have to terminate them and reactivate.

9) Since the last patch changing the treatment centers (stationary), I have to go through this routine EVERY time I want to change an impant.   a) click treatment center, change implant.  Select second implant to change and it tells me I need medical help with this (or whatever that statement is).  I click again and have to wait.  After 5 min I click again on treatment however it will still not allow me to swap another implant.  Here is what I have had to do since you 'fixed' the treatment centers:   a) Change first implant b) zone out of store c) right click on treatment, wait 5 minutes for it to go away.  d) right click on treatment again, change implant, zone out of store e) start that whole process over again.

I HAVE petitioned IN game about this.  It is a major problem for me.

10)  Group leader issue - This problem is not as major but still a problem.  When in group if the leader just leaves the group, drops from group then we end up with no leader and no group control.  We all have to disband and regroup to re-enable group leader functions and buttons.  In many cases, some members actually have to log out of the game and return to get buttons back working.

Well that's enough for now.. Other items are not as pressing.  Many of us would prefer that you spend some time fixing these bugs instead of adding new features.  Yes we want the 'new' things also but when a bug causes us to loose HOURS of hard work in game, they become a priority.  Each patch I look forward to seeing what bugs you have resolved.  But it seems lately that every patch adds more features or fixes bugs that are so obtruse that they affect a very minor segment of the game.  These bugs I have listed affect ALL players and impact direct game play.  To many of us those are the bugs that should be a priority with minor bugs secondary to that.

Anyhow, I sincerely hope this is looked into.  For the first time since I started Ao from day one, I found myself wondering whether to continue playing the game because I was so frustrated with some of these bugs.  I really enjoy the game and understand what it takes to create and maintain something this large.  But I am not asking for every little thing to be resolved immediately.  Instead I am simply asking for fixes for things that have caused me and others major loss within the game..hours worth of playtime down the drain due to them.  Some items have reached the point where I will no longer play my soldier character because he does nothing but sit there and die.  I am now relegated to playing my engineer until such time as a soldier can survive in game over level 50.  And I find my engineer having almost as many problems now.

Feel free to contact me for more information if needed.  Thanks.

Sincerely,

Todd B

Hmm....

If I do not exit the playfield after equipping (2) pistols, I seem to try to hit the baddies with the pistol handle every other shot instead of firing.  Now since I have no melee skill, I either miss entirely or hit for 12....It's pretty funny though, but I can see how it could be annoying too... I zone anywhere and the problem goes away.

Catalyste @ 2/18/2002 2:22:22 PM (7788):
Been there, done that...sigh

Catalyste @ 2/18/2002 2:26:24 PM (11749):
btw, I noticed this 1 day before the 13.7 patch arrived, so...???

Desbet @ 2/18/2002 2:28:51 PM ("the list" of things i've had go wrong. 11750):
Perhaps some of this is game knowledge I don't have, but in general I do not beleive so (having done my fair share of hacking and/or programming)  

   Each of the things on this list has happened more than once, and not more than . . . every time.

  A rooted NPC/monster in mission:  Will unroot itself and flow through the walls of the mission on intercept course with me. (happened 4x)

  Firstaid yourself and/or teammate then rapidly switch back to NPC/monster and the 'healing halo' will appear on that monster rather than the healed target.  *Note:  The healed target still gets healed, its just the graphics.  (every time)

  Burst mode (this one pisses me off).  If you fire burst mode with fewer than 3 rounds of ammo in the weapon the remaining ammo is lost -and- the burst action.  You need to reload and wait the recharge of burst action. (every time)

  Random zone crossings rearrainges my INV.  I heard this was fixed but i've had it happen; dozen times.  Sorry but I wasn't in the list sort of mind to record the places it happened. (dozen times)

  I fire my weapon two (2) times per single (1) hit on a NPC/monster.  I fire once (1) for every miss.  Burst and auto modes, aimed shot... all special attack modes (when they display at all) use the correct ammount of visual representation.   this is annoying but like firstaid, nonthreatening.  (always)

  Mission bug.  others have said something about it already.  -crash- / -exit client-  return, things not the way they should be.  On the up side I had already completed the mission(s) and was only cleaning out critters.  I did lose the xp that I had earned 
-after- i finished the objective. (not more than 3x {for a total of 10,000ish xp})

   3rd person view:  The -ELEVATION- of the view does not reset properly after sitting.  I end up looking into/through my characters -back- instead of my favorite position of just over the shoulder.  *note:  i have found that ctrl-f8'ing through "rear" and then back to "fixed" will reset the -elevation- properly so that I'm looking over the characters head.  (every time I sit/stand/move too quickly)         And a note to those who's view is zooming all the way out, if you hold down CTRL to change the angle -while- you are "autorun" it will zoom -away- from your character.  I've had it happen afew times.  The camera stays in the location where you hit CTRL-rightclick, while your character runs away. (IE zoom out)

  The rest are just gameplay complaints, cause I'm the sort to do that 

   Can't find a lefthand/righthand SMG with only SMG and Burst.  Everything for dual weild has a pistol requirement on it.  I wouldn't complain but the pistol req is as high as the SMG skill req.

   Sneaking is pointless.

   Snipers (admitedly I've missed the pre-tweak sniping days), suck.  The only way I was able to gloat and use my "one shot one kill" script was when I aimedshot a leet. (as a lvl 30 agent)  and i mean one of the noobie leets....  outside the doors of omni1.
One aimed shot and then you have to root, run, try to hid again and even ifyou do the critter has healed the meager damage you've done it by the time it 'doesn't notice you' ....  main reason i went fixer.

   I wasn't able to throw the grenades I won.  Had the skill, had the range, had it all set just like normal, then I attack and the grenades deselected themselves and put themselves in my pack.




    All in all...  I'm still going to play AO and with as little .. can i say that? B  ching as possible.  But hey, if mentioning the problem can get it fixed it will maximize my enjoyment of AO for long time to come.  Keep up the great work and psst!  get me dual QL 50ish solarpowered SMG...

Sharee @ 2/18/2002 2:52:31 PM (Engie+Crat = pet bugs 11755):
Several times I have found that my engineer pet will not respond normally and believe it only happens when in a team with a Bureaucrat. I also have seen MP's in the team complain of similar problems. Here is a list:

> Bot will not respond immediately to attack commands. Often will not respond untill the npc has been killed by the rest of the team then replies, finally, No I will not attack myself. 

>Bot will not autoattack like usual if you are attacked. Will stand there and watch you die and not do anything to help unless told to attack and response time is extremely slow. (see above)

>Bot will not return to your side after an npc it has killed or helped kill has died. Will just stand there apparently studying the remains? If it is any distance away you have to go find it and tell it to follow you after each fight. Also very slow response again.

>Bot seems to get lost following you and just stops moving, you have to go back and tell it to follow several times before it will respond and may get lost again. On a long run this is extremely annoying.

>In missions the bot never seems to know where you are, gets lost very easily and gets stuck on doorways constantly or traps itself in a corner trying to get to you. (yes, even worse than normal bad pathing)

>If the Crat in the team has an npc "charmed" then all of the above problems are even worse. Response time to commands are even longer, sometimes won't respond at all for a couple of minutes.

And no, there was no chat lag at the times I have experienced these problems. Immediately after leaving the team the Bot goes back to responding like normal. Has anyone else run into this? Or have anything to add?

Catalyste @ 2/18/2002 2:53:01 PM (Who has the record? 11757):
Well, I hear more and more about this bug regarding getting hit multiple times in one shot, and that it's getting worse...(I agree).  First it was double critical hits, and then triples, and after the 13.8 thingy, I got hit 11 times in what appeared to be a single shot (I never got to even aim).  I heard one person who claimed to get hit 30 times!!!

I am sorta wanting to lighten our attitudes on this until it gets fixed, so how about it?  What is the most YOU have been hit in a single shot (lagdeath, instant nukes, etc)??  While you are at it, how much damage was it for?  (mine was 110, 11 times, but my health was already low, so....  %)

I don't want a debate, here, since we all know:

1) Its a client issue (Uh well, um, ok that makes me feel a lot better, I think)

2) It has gotten worse since 13.something

3) It's not just inside any more.

4) The baddies who do it are NOT getting banned for exploiting!!! *grin*

5) It hurts, but its still kinda funny when you are standing there and someone just falls over for no reason.  I was attacked 8 times for 550 points of unknown damage, I told my team to laugh, since we were not even attacking anything at the time, and I had no "dot" on me either.  OK, maybe its not that funny to lose 2 million...sigh

6) And, "We cannot restore lost experience points"  Hey, it's ok. I actually understand and respect this, but I did not call you to get the XP back, just to let you know it happened...


This is not to gripe....but to laugh at ourselves a bit.  Just post where, when, and how much damage and how many times, I will give my old Yalmaha to the winner *grin*

Scorus @ 2/18/2002 3:10:43 PM (11757):
Well, this is a little outside the realm of damage, but I swear I was hit with all 6 Unmakes simultaneously this weekend! I mean they just scrolled across my chat window at light speed. And I had just been ransacked by the mobs partner. Luckily I was in a group cause all I could do was stand there dumbfounded...

Scorus

Mustafo @ 2/18/2002 3:15:33 PM (init bug 11763):
I think I have been running into a bug, but before I go and report it I wanted to find out if other people have run into this.  Also hopefully someone from funcom can answer if this is intended, as it might be.

It seems to happen on melee users mostly but I have had it happen on others.  If you calm a NPC when it comes back and starts attacking the init seems to be doubled or more.  This also seem to occur if you zone, like hunting at a zone border or zoning out of a mission and then back in. 


Since I turn other effects off I can't see zone borders anymore and this happened to get me killed.  I was hunting near the border and something attacked as I happened to zone.  I zoned back to fight it and found myself getting hit at such an astounding rate it wasn't funny.  I went back and fought the same creatures in the same area for several hours without having this problem.  I have also had it happen using calm, but in all cases it seems inconsistent.

As I stated this may be intended to avoid zoning and calming as tactics in hunting. I just want to verify since it is so inconsistent.

Rowenna @ 2/18/2002 3:22:30 PM (Main gripe: exp loss due to BUGS! 11768):
Essentially, the main gripe and cause of frustration I experience in this game is not so much bugs - of which I get to see 1 to 3 new ones each and every play evening - but the experience loss caused by bugs and bad game design.

I don't mind losing 95% of level experience if its my fault - well I do to be honest, but I'm not that angry and disapponted as when exp loss is caused by FC. Consider following:

° Returning from mission that brought me in 90% expereince, I run onto a 4 vultures mid on a street in Avalon. My car is fast, I have good chances to dodge/skid through, but... the first aid kits don't work when you drive and are attacked until well out of battle... (40k exp lost, not my fault?)

° We used to get stuck on watery edges in cave missions, the mobs used to freeze then attack after 5 or more minutes with 20+ stream of vicious hits at once (client-server communication error?) killing you on the spot. (50k exp lost, evening done, AO shutdown)

° My staff creation somehow began not to disappear on its end of 2 hours. I cannot attack to add some 300-some and more posion damage mid in fight, try again and again to futively start the battle per Q key. Wandering whats on, before GM told me its a know bug (?) I die, lose 36k exp. AO evening off.

° Mob drops on you from down below (aggro pathing??), joins 2-3 other reds from first mission room. You get insta-rooted and insta-nuked since 13.6 patch. Insta-death (not your fault) and you're dead, wham-bam there goes 20 mis ride into wilderness and your exp up so far. 

° Zone border aggros: since several patches ago, you get aggroed on zoning even without making that first step (that used to save you). Now you get zone camped by aggro mobs on both sides, until you die. Shades of EQ. Not enjoyable.

° yesterdays 45k loss: server error, I get dumped mid in fight deep mid in a huge mission. I get in as soon as possible (5 mins later) to find all pets gone, and all of the mission space RE_POPULATED with mobs I killed before. The map is, "of course" gone and lost, so I miss the exit while running out by some 2 rooms more, dying 3 m from the exit door. Such fun! FUN COM or FUn CON? heh 

° etc, dying to bugs, losing huge exp chunks. I think if I discover few more fun die bugs far off in wilderness missions, I'll have to ditch this otherwise promising game in order to save myself from frustration (I don't mind 13$).

Enjoyable? Don't think so. 
If FC is not capable of tidying the bugs that lead to severe exp loss, why at least not lower the exp loss to 20% of the level exp?

msgnomer @ 2/18/2002 3:27:55 PM (Leet animation bug 11769):
Finally got leet form as an agent and I am experiencing some 100% repeatable problems.  After going into leet form, I start by sliding forward when I move (NOT lag).  If I back up, I start the run movement animation going and it continues whether I am standing still or moving forward.  Jumping in the air stops the leg movement animation and once again all movements will be with the sliding motion.  This is completely repeatable.

Summary:
(1) jump in air = stops any run/walk animation and all subsequent movement is sliding

(2) back up = starts run/walk animation which will continue indefinitely whether moving or not.

Now, I don't think this happens to all leets or I would have seen it or heard about it before.  Anyone else seen this or know how to fix it?  (My system includes 933MHz pentium, Geforce2, 512K ram).  I filed a bug report, but maybe someone knows a workaround in the meantime.

Ampris @ 2/18/2002 4:35:06 PM (11748):
2)  Playing along, again in a group, and fighting creatures.  Suddenly party members start dying suddenly.  They go from full health to dead in 1 sec.

Yes, I recall that this happens when you typically get an "Attacked by -NONE-".  MOB is at extreme range or moves out of targeting range.  It seems that the damage messages are not sent to the client when this happens.  You don't know that you are being attacked and your HP are not updating.  Workaround:  Target yourself and press 'T' to update your HP bar.

I also sometimes see mob dying without me doing any damage to them.  Then when I fight another mob, it seems that all of those queued damage messages appear at the start of that fight and mob HP bar drops.  But that damage isn't actually done since mob keeps fighting with an empty HP bar.


4)  shoulder boards and tokens
(stuff deleted)
However after dying or zoning, everytime in fact, the visual of the boards goes away as does the effects of the bonuses.

I was upable to replicate this.  The visual effects do vanish, but the bonus remains.  You can verify bonuses by simply removing the merit board.  Your HP should be reduced by the amount of the merit board bonus when you remove it.  What merit board do you have?  Perhaps that particular one is bugged.


5)  Casting bots nano -  I am an engineer.  I recently bought a bot that said I needed Matmet of 258 and TimeSpace of 258.
(stuff deleted)
I now need a 265 in each to activate the bot!

Yes. Think this is a known bug.


7)  Repeatedly I find that enemies, once I am targeted, can shoot me through walls.. even when I am 6 or seven rooms away.  Additionally, the bot I use gets easily stuck in walls or runs around away from where I tell it to go.

From what I recall, they only seem to be able to attack through walls if they are inside the wall.  So I guess that somehow they are getting stuck in the walls and are not warping out since they are still able to attack you.


9) Since the last patch changing the treatment centers (stationary), I have to go through this routine EVERY time I want to change an impant.   a) click treatment center, change implant.  Select second implant to change and it tells me I need medical help with this (or whatever that statement is).

I was unable to replicate this.  After using the stationary treatment clinic I was able to take out an implant, swap in another one and then take that implant out and put back in the original implant.  What specific implants were you swapping?  Perhaps one of those implants is interferring with the operation of the stationary clinic.

I recall that there is a known bug when the 5 minute timer runs out.

Mustafo @ 2/18/2002 4:47:39 PM (Warping 11809):
I had a problem on Saturday where I was walking from the top of the hill in Athen Old north toward the advanced shop.  Every time I got near the shop I ended up by the save term on the hill just up from the whompa.  This happened repeatedly about 15 times.  I tried getting to the whompa and I would never get to the bottom of the hill.  I finally slowly walked to the north stopping every few steps and waiting 10 seconds.

the NPC wandering around in that area went from by the shop to on top of the hill and down the other side while I was doing this.

other people were moving about like normal as far as I could tell.

Tetra @ 2/18/2002 5:09:10 PM (Pet bug introduced with 13.7(maybe 13.6 dunno) 11816):
Have spoken to several other pet classes if they have noticed the same behaviour with their pets as well as noticing it with their pets as well.  All of us have said that they did not notice the same behaviour before 13.7.  In essence without anyone getting aggro'd the pet will just suddenly initiate combat on it's own against some mob with no command telling it to do so.   Often times it will travel across multiple rooms seperate from it's owner rooms without being told


	
		
			
			
				Pet hits xyz mob for pzq damage
xyz mob attacks pet
			
		
	


	
		
			
			
				rather than
Pet "yes master let me kill it"
Pet hits xyz mob for pzq damage
xyz mob attacks pet
			
		
	
or some other combination that involves the mob attacking first or the pet aggroing because the master was attacked.

zophee @ 2/18/2002 5:09:19 PM (11748):
9) You will get this if you move during the implant process. Do NOT move and the clinic works

Gene13 @ 2/18/2002 5:30:05 PM (9971):
Still getting the insta/chain casting bug sometimes. Got better with whatever it was you did, but only in some missions. Did a mission today where mobs were casting waaay too fast, and often.
Had a fixer fickle fate me over and over again, and a skilled clan scientist chain-nuking me (Boy, was he skilled. Didn't even see his arms move).

govinda @ 2/18/2002 7:20:49 PM (Can't use certain grid exits (yes I have high enough complit) 11836):
I'm a relatively new player and yesterday was my first time using the grid. I'm a neutral trader with 90 complit unbuffed and 145 buffed, and some of the exits from the grid do not work for me even though my comp lit skill is high enough.  

Some exits work fine, like Omni-1 Trade and Tir. Some exits tell me I need a higher comp lit skill to use. However, Newland and Meetmedere exits do not work for me.  I get no message about needing higher comp lit, nothing happens at all. I just stand on the exit or jump on and off it and never leave the grid, watching all the other little inverted pyramids run by me and exit the grid with no problem.  I know my skill is high enough to use both these grid terminals as I was able to enter the grid from both Newland and Meetmedere.

I tried a /petition to see if I could get some help and the person I spoke to was unable to help, all he could do was "add it to the bug database"

Has anyone else had problems like this? Any ideas why these grid exits are not working for me?

Loretta @ 2/18/2002 8:29:05 PM (11702):
I've posted another petition about my former petition being cancelled without a reason.

I guess I'm on someone's list...

Hi Letah

Arinia @ 2/18/2002 10:34:29 PM (11836):
You need to have one more than it says.

I.e. Newland you need 91, not 90, so if you are running unbuffed this may be why.

Also, sometimes position gets bugged in the grid and you have to run over the exit 3 or 4 times to get in (and usually you will enter the grid while you are far off the pad).

squirk @ 2/18/2002 10:39:10 PM (Long delay in mission generation?? 11849):
I was just trying to get a mission and when I hit "Request Mission", I would wait and wait and wait and got nothing.  I tried leaving the settings at default, and I tried tweaking them - easy, stealth, mystical, etc.  Still nothing.

I saw other folk walking up to the mission terminal and then head off to the subway, so it would appear that THEY were getting missions.  

I can't figure out why it wasn't working for me.

Any ideas?

vespucci @ 2/18/2002 11:24:17 PM (This bus is nasty!!!! 11854):
So I'm in a mission and I just killed a MOB.  All of a sudden, client crash.

No big deal.  I was not in a fight so, I'll just blow AO out of my system memory and restart.

All goes smoothly and I get the "your character is already in play" dialog box with the login button and I proceed.

My character comes back to view, but I'm not in the same corridor I was in.  In fact I was in a very dangerous room that I was working around with 2 Hardened NanoGuns chain nuking me to death.  My view comes back in time to see my character in its death wail.  Next stop.... Reclaim.  

So my character wandered into the room on it's own?  Not likely.....

For my character to get to that room it would have had to make a right turn, run 20 yards, left turn, run 20 yards, right turn run 20 yards, enter a square room with 2 doctors, turn right, run 30 yards, enter the dangerous room and run to the center of it...

All without my guidance????  Not F#$%ing likely Funcom.

It's not the 20k XP that I lost the makes me furious, it's these unbelievable BETA bugs we have had to put up with; which not only are ignored and go unfixed, but have gotten progressively worse over time.

In the meantime Funcom is taking bows for its accolades in the gaming community.  Some issues have been fixed, I do recognize that.  

However, we still have tremendous "LAG" and the client crashes have increased in number and have now gotten much more lethal.

Get to work FUNCOM, you still have much to do....

Vespucci Lvl 67 Adv.

Adventurers haved been moved down Funcom's "fix" list and are now 3rd, on the  list behind MAs and Agents.  Then they will get to the Adventurers...   maybe...

vespucci @ 2/18/2002 11:36:31 PM (11467):
If that is the case then these are of little or no value.

They sell for 100s of thousands of credits, and they don't work reliably.

I can't count on a device that may work and may not when I'm in very hostile territory.  Lucky I found it rather than spending all those creds.

My poor NT is dark blue in Vehicle skills across the board.

Guess I will have to find another creative way to get around.

Dont know if this has been posted, search turned up empty.
If you hop in to the grid using wearing a battlesuit, you will crash repeatedly.  At least I did.  A GM had to toy with my char some. He said it was a known bug and should be fixed next patch.

Good Luck,

FireC @ 2/19/2002 1:25:16 AM (11680):
I have had tabbing not work a few times. Can't say what might have caused it and relogging fixed it - in a mission though I can understand one might not want to do that.

As you described in #2, then it is a bug confirmed and needs to be fixed.


For #4, after playing around more with this, I was able to find that I do not always loose the 'bonuses' like I thought.  It apparently happens randomly but always after zoning.   However the VISUAL display of the boards does go away after every zone, as you agreed, and this does need to be fixed.  I, for one, would like to see the display stay visual as I think, especially for us roleplayers, that seeing someone rank is pretty cool... not to mention it is a good feeling to be able to show everyone else the hard work one has put into their character by displaying our earned rank.


#5  Hope it is fixed soon.


#7  Again hope this gets fixed soon.  It is very irritating to try and heal to save yourself when the enemy can hit you even when you are 5 or 6 rooms away and out of visual sight.    Since my posting I have also found that this may also be related to npc's training on you in numbers in missions.  You start to attack one creature/npc and suddenly a bunch come pouring out of doors until you are mobbed.


#9  I can reproduce this every time however thanks to the short reply from Darkzone, I have been able to isolate it even further.  He is correct.. IF you move even once after your first right click of the treatment center, you end up having to go through the whole routine I outlined before.  This is a big problem.  Many times I may need to buy a new implant or purchase a new cluster for one of my implants because the one I have is not the right QL.  Thus I move to the trade room to buy the new cluster or implant.

So this bug IS a problem as we should be able to move around inside the shop while working on our implants and clusters.

Once I saw Darkzone's reply, I tried it out and he is correct.  AS long as you do not move you are OK.  Move around buying items like I have and this bug is repro every time.



Thanks for the replies...  Hopefully issues like this get fixed quickly.  I know there are a lot of 'issues' but to me, it is universal issues like this that affect everyone that need to be addressed priority.

Take it light...

slimebot @ 2/19/2002 4:16:39 PM (7788):
I hate that bug.  It used to annoy me as a newb too, when I was still searching for 4 belts.  I would mission for one and it would instead be a 3 belt.

slimebot @ 2/19/2002 4:25:33 PM (Casting while sitting? 11942):
I was in a group the other day playing when I was beginning another round of an NT nuke.  I began the cast and then hit the "x" button on accident and sat down.  Oddly enough, sitting down didn't affect the casting of my nano in any way.  The nuke still launched 6 seconds later.  

Okay.  I realize this isn't a very interesting bug.  However, if you are an NT and you don't have a mob aggroed on you (as in a group the tank should) then when you cast the nuke you can use a nano pack or health pack right after it hits (because you are already sitting) so that if the mob aggros on you immediately you have already filled back up.

Actually, I think it is working as intended.  I think that the epaulets are supposed to vanish after zoning.

A suggested enhancement might be that using an upgraded merit board toggles the display of the epaulets on or off.

So clicking an upgraded merit board would cause them to be displayed.  While they are displayed, clicking the board would hide them.

Skara @ 2/19/2002 5:06:33 PM (11748):
Malakie,

When I click on the treatment center, I am ready to INSTALL my implants. I have already done all the leg work like buying and installing clusters into the implants. I have also made sure I meet the reqs and have run any nanos to raise secondary skills to meet those reqs.

From a roleplay perspective, it makes sense that you not move after clicking the terminal until you are finished installing implants. It is after all allowing you to perform a type of surgery on yourself.

Bottom line is, I don't see that as a bug that needs to be fixed. Get your implants ready to go, then click on the treatment term.

Mürten La Suée @ 2/19/2002 5:58:02 PM (I want to look fat!! 11949):
Hi there! My main character is a Neutral Atrox Engineer on Rubi-Ka 1 (goes by the name of Ghuntar). When I created him I choose that he looked small and fat. When I play I see him as small and fat so I never asked me any questions.
The problem is that he appears to other players as perfectly mesomorph! I know there are more serious problems to look at in the first place but I'd really like other players to see my characters as I intended them to look.

Misophist @ 2/19/2002 7:08:36 PM (11467):
A plane may be your only option. Believe me, I even raised the air vehicle skill for my meta who has a flying spell. But QW does me no good because I can't zone with it. 

Now the credits may be a problem. If you're lucky, you might even find a plane in a mission. But beware, saving up for your first plane is tough.

Atrocious @ 2/19/2002 8:06:28 PM (Mission problem when server goes down/restart or something. 11965):
Yesterday a friend and I decided to do a couple of missions for xp since most easily accessible spots to hunt now have been nerfed to hell by the 25% nerf of Mort. (Not really sure if I really care that much since I get pretty good xp doing missions since my main now a days is a engy.)

So we travel the far reaches of the land for some missions. The two first ones were small and took no time to complete. The last mission was huge and filled with Babyfaces, cyborgs and other fun stuff. We're both in the 70s and were doing a ql 96 mission. My friend is an NT and my char is a Engy. The bot is self buffed and does all the tanking. We have to be careful not to draw aggro away from the bot since both of us die damn fast if something aggros us instead of the bot. We have a few close calls, but some luck with calms and rabid hitting the aggro enchancer on my part. We make it half way through. My friend dies once due to calms not working properly and bot loosing aggro. It's par for the course. Risk vs Reward.

Then suddenly I get disconnected. I wonder if my wife accidentally touched something she shouldn't have :-), but no. All lights are ok on the router. I try to log in, but get discoed right away again. I wait a bit log on again. If find that the whole dungeon is respawned and I'm alone without my trusty bot in a room with three yellows.... Needless to say I try to run for it, but not too my suprise I die. 217k right down the drain. The hard work of my last hour down the drain. 

No if I had been killed by carelessness. I wouldn't have minded. If we died from a bad pull, or something that can be attributed to our fault. Then fine. I'll take the xp loss and all that, but when the server hickups or something and respawns all the mobs and chests in the dungeon then something is ****ing wrong.

I suggest that FC implements a teleport when a server reboot happens. I don't care if I have to travel back out to a hunting ground or a mission area, as long as I don't loose any xp.

This is not the first time this has happened to me. It has also happened on hunting trips. Back in the ole' days when the servers where crowded and certain areas has lots of mobs and lots of players.

I find this to be a real problem, and will ultimately make me cancel my account if I have to die to server glitches. I wouldn't mind so much if I just lost items, but the xp is what is really "expensive" to me. Items you can always camp the terminal again for or you can do a few more mission runs to grab some money.

Drusillus @ 2/19/2002 8:21:29 PM (11965):
This exact thing happened to me last night.

   - I had cleared out almost the entire dungeon, to my knowledge I only had 2 mobs left to kill.

   - I got disconnected.

   - Quickly logged back in and was in a room full of mobs, and as I frantically ran for the door I pulled mobs from every room.  Of course my bot was no longer around, and without him I'm swiss cheese.

   - I was killed no less than 10 feet from the door, losing 90k experience (1/2 level) 

This is a new occurance for me, I've been disconnected when in dungeons before and gone back in with no new mobs spawning.

So the moral of the story is:

If you get disconnected when in a mission, go to bed and wait for the time limit to expire.

Does that help? Will I then be kicked out of the mission?

Miriandel @ 2/20/2002 12:42:10 AM (Fix Broken Shores ! 11998):
People get disconnected like mad in Home, and often can't log back in after 10 attempts.

I hope it's not related to the old TCP vs UDP debate, but if it is, consider spreading high level playfields, it's unbearable at the moment.

Naturegurl @ 2/20/2002 2:31:15 AM (MA's are NOT on Phys Init ! 12009):
This is a post I made earlier on the MA forum:

Ok. After reading several posts here, I started a wondering. It has been hinted to that maybe fist attack is actually on Melee Init and not Phys Init. Well I am here to prove that theory correct. 

THE TEST: 
2 MA's (L65) and L(1). Stopwatch timed fights vs Green mobs counting Attack-Bar cycles. Not counting actual hits, but counting number of times the attack bar Charged and Recharged. Charge and Recharge is 1 cycle. 

THE BACKGROUND AND STATS: 
MA#1 L65 - 324 Phys Init - 47 Melee Init (from attributes) 
MA#2 L1 - 6 Phys Init - 6 Melee Init 


THE RESULTS: 

MA#1 
--------- 
100% Aggro 
40 cycles 
88 Seconds 
Average: 2.2 c/s 

50% Aggro 
48 cycles 
186 seconds 
Average: 3.875 c/s 

90% Aggro 
49 cycles 
116 seconds 
Average: 2.36 c/s 


MA#2 
---------- 
100% Aggro 
46 cycles 
118 seconds 
Average: 2.56 c/s 

50% Aggro 
36 cycles 
148 seconds 
Average: 4.11 c/s 


The key to notice here is that the times for MA#1 (L65) are only marginally better than MA#2 (L1). Seems kinda strange with 324 Phys Init. Also notice that MA#1 has not reached the CAP of 1s/1s (2s cycle). Could this be because the actual Init for fists (Melee Init) is only at 47 and has not yet reach the 150 req to max the speed?? 

I wish I knew what to say, and I wish I could say this was a big surprise, knowing the bugs and mis-information this game has. 

FUNCOM - if you read this please take note.. This is not whining, this is hard evidence testing. This has to be fixed! If it cant be fixed then MA's need those IP's back, and Melee Init has to be made green. 

Mirandia 
---still stubborn and sticking with the MA.

/me crosses fingers...

Divillian @ 2/20/2002 6:21:41 AM (my bugs 12026):
Ive had a few bugs since the last patch and im usually the lucky one. 

What happens is 

1. If i use Burst on a mob before true combat occurs (I hit q or am attacked by mob) then the burst never completes and I am unable to use my weapon for the remainder of the battle and sometimes after that. I get a wait for special attack to complete message. Now this isnt a big issue as Im a NT but a lot of times I need that burst to get a head start over the mob in order to keep me from dying before battle ends.

2. My Attacking and Nanoprogram progress bars are all screwed up.  If i cast a nanoprogram before entering battle, then for the rest of the battle my nanoprogram bar wont go all the way to the end and will just hang there then dissapear no recharge no finish.

3. Sometimes when I cast a spell, nothing happens. It says executing but it wont execute. I have to "execute" it like 3 or 4 times before it does. Luckily its not that blackhole bug. So i dont lose any NP

4. Dont know if this is a bug or not but 90% of the chests i find in missions (locked or no) are empty. I'll open them 4-5 times before they dissapear and there is never anything in them.

Nothing killer no veratible blue screen of death (by the way that should be a Spell. Works like silence or somethin cast MSFT BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH on someone then their NCU crashes and they die. (j/k) Although its no horrible crash and burns like other people have been having (fix those first btw) these are additional bugs and it seems im the only one with them from what the other bug threads look like.

so uhmmm. YEA!!

Darkblood @ 2/20/2002 10:10:24 AM (11998):
BS has always been lag haven!

mostly seing as it's a 100% zone there is no way to clear out the multitude of NPCs and MOBs.

Now that BS has become a popular place the lag is magnified with other PC population.

get rid of the useless mobs pls!

ntrox1 @ 2/20/2002 1:14:47 PM (12026):
Basically, cutting to the crap, yes I have the same problems.  As an NT we need to cast fast and accurately.  Since the Nano time bar is screwed I cannot time the next cast, end up double selecting a nano and cancelling it, which leads me to your third problem.  You need to wait a good 20 seconds before you can cast.  As and NT you are probably dead at this stage cos you can't root/bewilder and nuke.  Bah!

A quick word of advice: lose the gun, and get a Glacial Advance or similar (dunno yr level).  I am lvl 39NT and can hit for 500 damage on the first cast, as long as I'm not aggro'd.

Cheers

I really hope that this isnt true it would be stupid beyond belive.
At first i laughed at your statement but the more i thought about it the more sense it made.

Just look at the new ma "toy" the flurry of blows that has been getting very popular amongst the ma society, the description clearly says it boosts melee speed and not physical yet many mas swear they see a speed increas from it when using fists only.

Zaal @ 2/20/2002 5:06:44 PM (11467):
Doesn't anyone read item descriptions?

Symbio grafts in general lock certain skills from being used for certain amounts of time.  This is by design and is NOT a bug.  The fact that it doesn't work from time to time is due to it's hacked nature.  If these were hacked with high end hacker tools they might be more stable.  ALSO by design....

Read people read....

Well what can I say - i'm really disheartened by this bug. Most of my friends on rubika 1 are engineers and I can team with them AND use my charm nanos because they all lost control of their bots! Its just not fair to have a crat that cant charm seeing as their bots are blatently weaker and less hard hitting than engineer ones - come on funcom please fix this - /tell Suarve in game if you need to know details about the bug - but from what i've been hearing, you already know exactly what is wrong.

Yours hopefully

assassimon @ 2/20/2002 6:34:10 PM (11749):
If you have over 150 (or something close)MA skill you both hit with fists and with weapons, I guess that's not good for everyone, but for MAs the problem is that you STOP to use your fists if you zone with a weapon in hand..

M'Hat M'Co @ 2/20/2002 7:48:33 PM (Da Taunter bug? 12135):
It seems sometimes when I use the Da Taunter in a fight it actually heals the mob.  No message indicates this but th health bar increases right as I "Da Taunt"

Also another small bug:  When I use the med-kit on myself during a fight the healing animation (white light) appears on the mob I'm fighting.  I get the added health so it's not a big problem.

M'Hat M'Co @ 2/20/2002 7:51:50 PM (11849):

M'Hat M'Co @ 2/20/2002 8:14:18 PM (11066):
Happens to me all the time.  Especially when I am fighting two mobs and I kill the first one.  I have to wait 10 seconds or so before I can attack the second.  Because of the "wait for previous attack to finish" thing.  I can understand it when I am using brawl but not Q attack.

M'Hat M'Co @ 2/20/2002 8:17:10 PM (10981):
I just posted a new thread on this.  Didn't read far enough down.

Same thing happens to me all the time.  2-3 times per mission.  It usually gives back alot more health than my Da Taunter damages though.

Zaal @ 2/20/2002 8:19:31 PM (12108):
Wow - thats pretty effed up.  Not unlike the time I was just standing outside the gates to West Athens and got a random series of 1995 XP six times in a row.    That only ahppened once and it was odd but what could I do about it.  I took it as replacement XP for XP lost because of server crashes at the time.  Whatever - it was insignificant in the long run anyway.

Mysaad @ 2/20/2002 10:29:34 PM (12009):
the speed increase is due to the increase in Agg/Def (apparently it's a hugh increase) not to the increase in melee init.

What will be proof postive that fist are on melee init. and not Phys. init. is to do Mirandia's test but with a L65 MA and a L65 ENFORCER using fists.  Set both Agg/Def to the middle and see who's faster.  If the enforcer is faster then fist has to be on melee init., if the MA is faster then fist is on phys. init.  If neither is faster then phys. init is broken.  In this case test with a Soldier and NT and have them use fist to see if for some unknow (and totally beyond comprehension) reason fist is some how linked to Range init or Nano init.

Divillian @ 2/20/2002 10:40:46 PM (12026):

DaveDread @ 2/20/2002 10:53:39 PM (12009):
I have about 550 in phys init. (maxed at lvl 110.)

I see a speed drop in my fist attack if I take agg/def bar down to 90%.

Dunno, I have a bad feeling about this...

/DaveDread

Mysaad @ 2/20/2002 11:08:36 PM (12009):
There is plenty of observational evidence that phys. init.  is broken.  But how do we confirm these observations with objective testing to prove to Funcom that what we see is true.

DaveDread @ 2/21/2002 1:20:23 AM (12009):
None taken whatsoever Mysaad, I just think that it's wierd that we should be doing the testing...

I mean, the devs have the tools to check this out quite a bit faster and more correct then we can. 

Oh, did a little test a while ago btw: 
Went down to 50% on the agg/def bar. 
Used my 'lil flurry. 
Percieved an increase in attack speed.

Too bad I didn't have a stopwatch or even the sense to have someone else around, but can anyone else try this?

Or does a Flurry increase phys init as well? Does it change your agg/def bar settings? Or are fists are on melee init?
If you're below the agg "ceiling" raising that "ceiling" wouldn't matter right?

Hm.
Double Hm even.

Devs? Help?

Cashish @ 2/21/2002 10:12:55 AM (Character model glitch 12298):
Ok, this is not a major bug in that it is (i think) entirely cosmetic, but it is somewhat annoying, and i have been uunable to fix it myself.

I don't even remember exactly when it happened,  i think i either died while leaving a mission area, or while in my kodiak (this was about 13.1 patch).

Anyhoo.. i was wearing a trenchcoat at the time, which disappeared (along with a belt and a couple NCU's) when i respawned.  the problem is that my character has been stuck with the trench model since then (i.e. it always looks like i'm wearing a skirt).  The colors/textures change to the appropriate armor or clothes, but the model stays the same.  I have tried changing clothes, armor, coat, vehicle, backpack - everything i can think of, with no luck.

Anyone else have this problem?

Vydas @ 2/21/2002 11:30:49 AM (9971):
have just got to go.  As far as I can tell, it only got better in that not every mission has them, now, but if a mission does have them, they all do it.

I have already stopped doing missions in BS, there are other places to do them in

Darkbane @ 2/21/2002 3:09:27 PM (11066):
This is very annoying, as it means you cannot begin a new fight until you end the current one (which you can't except by zoning). It can't be that hard to fix, even just checking to see if a player has taken or dealt damage recently, if not, end any outstandig fight. This wouldn't help with the multiple opponents thing though...

I often log out inside mission, after completing it when its really late. Now suddenly when i log back in the next day I am outside, in yalmaha and cant fly and die to mobs, losing all the exp.

When I log out inside a mission building, I expect to log back in inside it and not die outside. 

Fix it !

Hi Skara,

I would agree with you normally in the context of roleplaying however there is one problem with your theory..  Many people, myself included, are still trying to figure out how everything works together, what things do and how to do them. 

As everyone knows, the documentation is very lacking in some key areas.  Many times I have had implants ready with clusters only to find that the QL levels would not work together or that my treatment ability was not sufficient or other things.    I would then have to go buy a different QL level cluster, different implant or whatever and in this I would then have to go through the whole process I outlined.

Additionally, if you read my post again , you will see that even with your method there is still a bug.   At the very least, if I move, I should simply be able to wait the 5 minutes out and then click the treatment center again to start pasting my implants.  But this is not the case.  Instead I have to wait the five minutes, ZONE, come back in and click the treatment center, WAIT again for that 5 minutes to elapse and then click the center again at which time it works correctly FOR ONE implant placement.    Only after zoning out and then returning at a later time does the problem seem to clear up where you can do more than one implant as long as you do not move.

I mentioned the documentation.  There are some web sites one can get bits and pieces of information from.  However many people run in full screen thus they must leave the game to access that information.  And even so, there still is no comprehensive documentation explaining how things work, what to do with them etc etc etc..  I am not one that wants every little detail BUT something would be helpful.

For example,  We know we can use gem cutters to make better quality gems.  But did you know that the gem you cut is worth LESS than the original gem?   Or you can use a metal reclaimer to create ingots of gold or silver.. But again did you know they are LESS valuable than the ring you may have reclaimed?   Even farther.... all of those abilities were found by accident or trial and error.   Many people do not want to spend hours trying to figure out what tool may work with something you find.  Additionally, this trial and error methodology is way to expensive to be practical.   This SAME approach has cost me and others when it comes to implants and clusters.

Not to mention the fact that I have yet to find any good documentation that explains exactly what clusters do in some cases, who should use what, and what benefits you might gain from implanting certain cluster types.   Again lacking documentation.

You might say that is something people could enjoy... the trial and error of it all.   To a point, yes.  However AO is based on a 'futuristic' society where we have plasma weapons, teleporters and more..   At the least, that kind of technology should lead to some extensive computer database where anyone can look up detailed information on anything in Rubi-ka.

Your thoughts?

These all have been happening with the new patch.

Hi,

And I thought it was me!!    Here I am in a mission with very easy greens on one end and almost red on the other (same mission - go figure) and I kill the almost reds but the greens nail me with two nanos and I find myself sitting on a reclaim pod.

And like you, for a mission that I spent much time trying to get for the rare item.... only to die 8 times trying to complete it and end up deleting the mission.

I too hope this gets fixed soon.

Hi,

I reported this to FC three days ago and there is another thread on this one also which I started then....  Glad to see others reporting it now...

Before I reported it, I did my best to isolate this issue.   Basically if you are in a group and someone casts the charm nano, anyone with a bot looses control of the bot - period.

The group I was in did some testing on this to verify.  And we did confirm it.  The only way around it right now is for the charm caster to LEAVE the group right away and then rejoin the group.  You will find that once he/she leaves the group, all bot control returns immediately.

This bug cost the group I was in some major exp that day thus the reason we took the time to figure out what was going on.  I personally lost almost 400k of exp due to this bug before figuring out what was happening.   Once we did isolate it, none of us lost any more and the person who was casting charm was good enough to stop using it due to this.

Take it light!

Ah.. As an NT I root then run, then bewilder then finally I heal etc.  Thats the best way to do it.  If you're not an NT it doesn't help 

Do you have the problem where treatment packs aren't working? You press the hotkey, nothing.. You press it again.. nothing..  OK, you try and loot the ctir you just killed.. Nothing!  Eh?  Why can't I do ANYTHING??  Solution: leave the area and rezone, or just wait 5 minutes.  Aw man!  Pray you never get this - it sucks..

Smasha - I have to disagree. At first I didn't like XP purely cos AO was crap on it, now it works great and is (almost) stable.  Win2K was never meant for games, and the performance shows!  XP isn't as fast as Me for some games (no flames please!) but at least its stable.

This aint an invitation for a flame war, just my point of view

Do you really think those of us STUCK with 56K are doing so by choice?  Get real, get a clue.    Pisses me off when people like you forget that MOST of the world does NOT have the option of getting a high speed connection like you have.  Most of us are stuck with 56K as the ONLY option.

No, I will just stay here in my back woods log cabin and await the arrival of my new satellite dish.

RedSonja @ 2/21/2002 4:56:23 PM (12327):
That isn't a bug.
When you complete a mission both the key and "mission" vanish from your inventory.
When you log back in you are no longer 'entitled' to be inside that mission location, it is the key that gives you access - something you no longer own.

Yes it is annoying that sometimes you are in an un-flyable Yalmaha, however that is the only bug in your scenario.

It's weird, sometimes it happens a lot, and then you don't notice it for a while. But...

Since my main is a meta right now, I use the break root bug (I know, I know -- an "exploit"). But as soon as I break the root, it's back on me again. No wind up, nothing. So it's root, break, root, break. Insta-cast extraordinaire. I'd love to have the nano init of these mobs.

My nano resist is poor, and I'm working on that when I hit caps, but a lot of level 150+ tell me it doesn't even work. ARGH. Unfortunately, beefing up nano resist seems like the only way to alleviate these insta-cast mobs for the time being.

this is not really a bug. the description is not anything to rely on. if you check the modifiers (which is just there above the description) it will tell you Free Slot XX. i mean, i wish that my nanos and weapons did what the desription said:

Mausser Particle Streamer
The MPS holds twin chambers of Sub-Space Invigorators, enabling a particularly nasty firing rate. An exquisite weapon. 

Attack 1.0s
Rechage 3.0s

nasty firing rate? 4.0 seconds? uh, no. ranged init bonuses aside, just making a point.

Balderac @ 2/22/2002 12:53:53 AM (10704):
This is a problem that appeared for me after the patch. 

Me and a NT friend were doing 2 missions in Wailing Wastes. In the second mission the mobs, 7 of them actually where killing eachother. We just stood there watch them drop 1 by 1. 

When we had almost finished the mission, we both got droppped from the game, and when we logged on, the mission was reset, room full of red mobs, we both got killed instantly since we had no map and could not find the way out of there. 

This is something new. I never saw this before the patch, and i've done alot of missions.

the above is done because you are sitting...though apparent to your screen you are standing.


Now for the top prize......I take FALL damage and die losing nice XP (XP is not the concern so much as the time it takes to get x amount of lost XP)

3 fixers in big room. All of them spamming my NCU with the same program over and over again. By the time I had killed them I had 5(!) 'Nano Net' running. There is no way in hell I would survive a similar situation with my main char (85 fixer). What if these f u c k e r s had been NTs? I'm not even doing missions with my main anymore because of this. If this isn't fixed in the next patch I'm going to take a loooooong break from this game.

These were not the guys taking the hits. In fact, one of them hadn't taken a single blow. Full health, and then -Waaaaah! WTF?
I'm guessing these guys didn't have a lot of HP so it could have been a 'invisible' crit that killed them. However they said that they never were under attack.

Almohada @ 2/22/2002 7:02:28 AM (Mission Problems 12408):
Over the past couple of days I have been doing a lot of missions.  Most work.  A few haven't.

I went on a non-team breaking and entering mission with a person as my team member.  The objective was to kill all monsters inside and bring back the item.  We killed all of the monsters.  The item was nonexistant.  We both looked at least ten times and did not find it.  I camped and then logged back in later to look again.  While I did so, someone randomly logged in *in the mission zone* who had been logged off for four months.  I submitted two seperate petitions on this subject, one for the initial time, and yet another after the first one got dequeued.  I got no response to either.

Today I went on an item retrieval mission.  I took two from the same terminal at the same time, figuring that since there were 6 slots to take missions with, this would work fine.  I returned the item for one mission.  Worked fine.  Tried for the second.   Nothing.   I tried repeatedly (I lost count) to put the item into the mission terminal.  Nothing happened.  I put in a petition.  As far as I know I am still fouth in queue a few hours later.

I have yet to receive any kind of confirmation that anyone knows about these problems or even cares about them.  Needless to say it is really beginning to turn me off to the game.  These two minor things have been a massive time sink and source of frustration on my part.  I realize the ARKs are volunteers and all, but it'd be nice to see more Funcom employed folk on more consistently to troubleshoot these issues, as the ARK volunteers cannot be online constantly.

Hope this helps someone else to avoid my troubles.  I certainly don't expect any kind of resolution.

Yeah i know about this. I can tell you what happened. Me and my team was off doing some missions and we decided to save. After i saved i went into the shops to sell of some junk and then zoned out again - atleast i tried zone out. I got stuck between shopzone and Home City in some way. I tried log on for 10 times or so but still my character was stuck between the two worlds. Strange. I even tried after 1 hour, but still the same problem.

I couldn't play with my main character so i decided to log on another one, and /petition about this. In 3 hours a friendly GM helped me zone in correct way - HE zone warped my char to Grid.

At first i told the GM my char was stuck in the map home city/shop in some way, but he didn't think that was the problem. It must have been the server who couldn't transport my char to the outside i guess. Many ppl suffer from LD in Home City. It's annoying and time consuming - not only for players but for GM:s too.

I hope they manage to solve this soon.

You can upload missions to the world map directly from the mission terminal.  Just hit P to see exactly where those missions are.

!cc addbuddy <name> adds any persons name to your friends list.  Even offline ones.

!cc rembuddy <name> removes a person from your friends list

!cc rembuddy ?    removes ALL people under the ? in the friends list. (I LOVE this one).

/played is a fun command....tells you how long you have been playing your character on your current side (omni/clan/neutral), it resets when you change alignment.
You can move your hotkey bar to vertical (instead of the default horizontal)...I 'think' its CTRL + LEFT click on the tab on the left of it.

CTRL+ALT+F  shows your current Frames Per Second in the upper left side of your screen.

This is a good command to:

/tell helpbot whois insertcharacternamehere and you will get full information who that person is

No, it is a bug.  When you grab the mission it will tell you that it is for a (I forget the wording for belts) Belt Component Platform 4-x and when you actually pick it up in the mission it will say that it's a Belt Component Platform 3-x.  This is on the item name, not even including the description.  Basically, they don't even give you what you were supposed to be looking for... modifiers aside.

When you are going on a mission that you will find something and get something (full bad, full money) there are belts in the description you can't see the modifiers on (the item to find) and they are VERY misleading.

I have had this problem for aslong as I have been able to sneak. I have assumed that you (Funcom) know about it, or I would have reported it earlier. Anyway here goes,. I am sneaking, using a cloaking device. An enemy spot me, I try to take of the Cloaking device to fight it, but the Cloaking device simply would not come off. I can not fight, I can not heal and my choice is to either run out of the mission area (dragging dozens of mobs with me) or dying.

There are also times when I have stopped sneaking, that I can't start sneaking again, and my short-cut icon (indicating sneaking) aren't always correct.

No, I max out Nano Resistance and never resist a casting. Mobs seem to have maxed out health, nano pool, all initiatives, all nano skills and all combat skills. And on top of that they can attack while casting nanos and seemingly cast multiple very long nanos at the same time. I was hit by three long-casting NT nanos simultaneously yesterday. Wish I could say they are the worst exploiters in the game, though.

Blue blobs are particularly nasty - and deadly - on Test.  With 13.81 if you got one and tried to delete it you crashed the server - seriously - and when it came back up it wass still in your inventory.  If you try to sell it the same happens.  The only way I have been able to get rid of them was to store them in the bank and give them to an ARK.

With 13.84 it doesn't crash the whole server anymore but it crashes the person handling the blob, so I suspect they are trying to work this bug (and a few others) out before releasing this on live.

Let me start this off by saying i have(had) the novice title and was about 300+ kills into it, and have plenty of witnesses to agree with it. 

So im in 2ho having some fun pvping with all my buds, doing pretty good, losing people on both sides of the conflict, but overall im liking it. At one point i go outside, didnt see how many people there were, got rooted, couldnt cast mk shield cuz of the ncu problem with normal shield, and die. Ok big deal, just one death, hell not like this is a first time. Waiting for reclaim, press F1, and in shock, see the gimped Apprentice title above my name. How is this possible, no one was grey there, i had hundreds of kills into Neophyte, and im knocked down into Apprentice.

I know Novices have died who probably werent even close as to how far in i was, and havent lost there title. I also know a Neophyte who has died numerous times and not lost the title.

This has happened to Dankman and Snarf as well (send them tells and ask them yourselves) who are also atrox,  again not sure if that has anything to do with this bug.

Basically i want my title back, yes, i should of lost a bit on my title, but knocked down to apprentice? i dont think so.

I will be posting this in PvP conflict and Game-play bugs, and will bump this every single day untill i get a post from a FC rep telling me what this is.

I was on a mission, and we were taking turns with chests.  Turns out i could't pick the lock, so my friend picked it.  Guess what!?  A brand new QL80 something Yalmaha.  I have been waiting to find one for ever.  And now... I still don't have one.  My friend does.  At least she was Nice enogh to let me know it was there.  I am very sad and kinda upset.  I petitiond to see if I could have it transferd.  Guess what.  NO!  The Ark then said all you have to do is pick the lock, then wait for it to close and then ANYONE can loot it.  Well.... i went with the same group.  Guess what.  That doesn't work here on RK1.  So.... PLEASE FIx this.  Because it would be nice to share.  since it was supposed to be my loot.

Ok, then take it out of your bags, put it back in the main inventory and THEN try and give it to the terminal.  I think that this is the same bug as in the shopping terminals, where they won't accept the item to sell unless you take it out of the bag (if it was the mission item).

Hukk @ 2/23/2002 5:31:40 PM (12543):
I had this problem, and tried the fix that slimebot suggests, but it didn't work. Did anyone else have any luck, or is the mission broken forever if you move the item out of your inventory?

Laeni @ 2/23/2002 5:35:31 PM (12498):
Yeah but he or she seems to be talking about the live server and s/he shouldn't be getting so many blue blobs at this date. That's why I ask if s/he was always drawing the same kind of missions--in other words trying to pin down where the problem might be.

So THAT's why that one mission of mine didn't work. DUH! I'll have to remember to keep those items in the main inventory. Damn and there was a nice reward for that mission too.

Riot @ 2/23/2002 7:10:00 PM (10016):
its been two weeks now scince ive been unable to chat. i havnt heard from fc scince thursday of last week. ive emailed them several times. i even started a new complaint to them last night and still no answer. my assumption is that there will not be a fix for this. i love this game but its just gotten to difficult. ive tried being a "mime" not being able to chat. i cant even trade with credits cause i cant type in the credits. i found a ql 103 nova for 150k and couldnt buy the damn thing. this is really pissin me off. they should at least send us mail saying that it wont be fixed so we can cancel our accounts. if not fixed by around the 15th of march im canceling and going to DAOC, its the only mmorpg ive yet to play.

I take it they look like blue blobs on your machine?   I know why.  It is due to your video configuration and if you have ANTI-ALIASING and Mip-Mapping turned on for your video card, boards show as blobs and most text is blurry.

Turn off anti-aliasing and mip-mapping and you will amazed at how nice the game really looks.

Myself and many that I have talked to about this like the idea of having them float above to show all.  It looks nice as well.

But I was confused by your statement that you have to drop resolution to see the boards?

That is something up on your end as I am running in 1280x1224 at 32 bit and I have 49fps with NO visual problems.

The shoulder boards look good on anyone that uses them.

...in missions, or in the field, or both? 

In missions a reasonably easy way to get rid of the over-nanoed mobs is to set the phys/myst slider all the way to phys. You still get some casting but it's nowhere near as ridiculous as if you leave the slider in the middle. Mobs really appear to have infinite nano pools. Luckily their casting AI is terrible, half the time they spend time casting and re-casting root nanos when I'm already beating the crap out of them and have no intentions of running off.

I suppose the higher level you are the more inevitable the chain casting mobs are, so my advice may be of no use to you. But it did seem to help when I was running into this after the patch.

Try downloading the MSVM from Microsoft, and the Sun Java machine as well just in case.  Also make sure you install sockets 2.0, which is included on the CD I believe.  Saying that Win95 is incompatible is utter crap.  The driver model allows you to update almost any aspect of the OS.

The Notum Viper's casting of MissingName was interrupted

or something to that effect. Is this a bug? Is MissingName some top secret monster nano program or is it simply a placeholder that showed up because Vipers can't actually cast nano spells? I've seen it a couple of times recently, and I don't ever recall seeing it before.

When I got it the icon was for an Android NCU but the description was still for an NCU16.  I put it in my deck slot and it works but now I find that when I'm in stores the higher level NCU icons..the blue cylinder ones..now appear  asthe Android NCU icon.

I have a 4 slot belt and 3 of the ncu's that were pre-mission are still graphically ok..but the new mission received NCU and all the stores NCU's (only the blue ones - not the lower level yellow NCUs) are the Android NCU icon.  

How can I fix the icons back????  HELP


I will post this in technical forum as well, just not sure if it's a but or my system or a bug so posted here as well

Nexuss @ 2/24/2002 8:51:00 PM (12658):
In beta all NCU Memory upgrades had icons that are now used for Android NCU (there were no android ncu's in beta).. so the only explanation is that some ncu's are still using the old graphics. Don't worry though, their functionality isn't affected by this.

Mookem @ 2/24/2002 9:07:48 PM (12658):
Thx Nexus,  yup functionality does seem okay.

Seems to be the 16-31 NCU's that are affected.  I just want to make sure something didn't corrupt on my computers client software and if it is on my side find out how to correct it (possibly re-install?)

Just to confirm its not my client software - Anyone else out there confirm that their NCU 16-32 icons are the Android ones?

Nexuss @ 2/24/2002 9:17:23 PM (12658):

Soozan @ 2/25/2002 12:21:00 AM (Bots and health. 12677):
Yeah, so this has happened on a couple of occasions and I thought I'd bring it up.

Basically, the what happens is this:

Step 1: Enter mission
Step 2: Get your arse kicked and leave your bot behind to mop the floor with them
Step 3: Enter the mission again to find your bot getting its arse kicked
Step 4: Tell the bot to follow and leave the mission so that you and your bot can recover
Step 5: Bot doesn't recover any HP's
Step 6: Enter a fight and kill mob
Step 7: Still no HP recovery
Step 8: Enter a fight, Bot gets hit, kill mob
Step 9: Bot heals

Basically you have to find a mob that isn't powerful enough to kill your bot that only has 4% health remaining.  It has to be strong enough to hit the bot at least once though.  Kinda annoying, but nothing that major.

Umm.  I underlined some things in that post by Malakie that I thought were... well... frustrating.

So, what you're saying is that is IS your fault that you have a 56k.  If it made you so angry you WOULD move to a larger city.  If you are going to get a "new satellite dish" then you shouldn't really be angry.

Which brings me to another point, why are you angry?  Do you think that a 56k modem HELPS latency?  Do you feel that insulting a 56k modem is insulting you?  Do you feel so insecure that you need to get angry about a slowdem?  Oh my fault... I meant MODEM.

There are always alternatives.  Hell, if your telephone/cable company felt there was a market (Read "People were actually going to use it") for a High Speed Internet Connection they'd probably upgrade.  Having people call/email the cable company worked where I used to live.

Sheffy @ 2/25/2002 2:10:40 AM (Team window health bar issues *FRUSTRATED* 12688):
Ugh.

Two bugs with the team window health bars.. one of which has been here for months.

One:  I team with my roommate every day.  Occasionally (yes, rarely, but it *does* happen), I will see him start to run from a battle because he's almost dead (we're near a zone) and he says "Heal me!!"  On my team window, I see his health bar at about 95%.  I go downstairs to his computer, and I see him at about 10% health.  Definitely a bug here.

A second roommate of ours was also playing with us and saw the same thing I did -- 95% health on the bar.. when in reality, he was almost dead.  This can be devastating when you are a doctor and you are trying to keep your group alive and you don't see anybody's health going down.

The second bug is not as scary as it is annoying, but it's been around for as long as I can remember.  If you buff somebody who's in your team with a +HP buff.. Then they heal up to full health (fill the extra HP), the health bar looks full in the team window.  But the second they get outside of your view distance and come back in, it'll look like they're missing health in the team window health bars.  You go and click on them, and it fixes and goes back to full health.  It's as if the game only calculates the player's health by their max HP without the buff.. not by their real max HP.

This is especially obnoxious in zones like Wailing Wastes where the view distance is very, very horrible and things disappear when they get 20 feet away from you.  Since your group generally does not stand on top of each other, people are constantly coming in and out of your view distance.  Again, if you're a doctor, looking at your team window, you see health bars at 70% and freak out, when in reality they are at 100% health.

These two bugs seem like very simple bugs to fix (the second one especially), and I'm surprised they haven't been fixed yet.  

Please Funcom, please fix some of these bugs.  I can send off a list of 20-30 small (but very annoying!) bugs which should be simple fixes, and it would make your players happier if your coders could spend some time on ironing out the quirks and bugs that exist *now* instead of adding huge new things like Camelot and Smuggler's Den, etc..

2 cents.

After I die, while re-gaining my health, if I use health recharges while sitting, I can usually only use one.  The second time I try to use one, it deducts it from my inventory, and the blue aura goes around my body showing a regen item was used, but my health only increases a few points (not the full recharge).  Use another one, and I get no increase in HP.  Use another one, nothing.  I zone, and then the health packs start to work fine again.

Darkblood @ 2/25/2002 6:49:49 AM (12689):
yup yup

think this has to do with your *lack* of hp and the now very much broken hp bar.

You will notice after you meet Mr Reclaim your *max* hp also goes up. So, the max part is constantly changing until it reaches your *proper* max.

Now somewher along the way, 13.7 realised it had more things to break. So, even though up til now you could heal yourself as you were recovering from res effects, or as I experienced even AFTER fully recovered, everything worked fine, it now doesn't.

The display shows your true max, but when you try to use health packs it will only heal so much. I've even had my hp bar drop after using it, and thereafter heals wouldn't progress past a certain (not full) hp value.

Thx wasting packs. Thanks yet again needing to gd zone to fix gd annoying ****e bugs.

When using a voodoo3 3k (I'm cheap.  sue me.) and equipping the night vision goggles (the newbie ones) I can see through floors and hills, which allows me to see players, mobs, and items (trees, grass, rocks) through hills and floors.  (not walls, however... oddly enough)  Although this can be used in pvp I suppose, its mainly just very annoying...  as I'd rather it work normally and not give me a splitting headache so I can see at night.


Also...  when using any type of light amplifyer, models are not brightened at all...  if an enemy is pitch black before I put on the torch/lowlightscope/night vis, then the enemy is pitch black after, I just can see the room better.  

Is this a glitch, a problem with my video card, or just the way the game works?  (as it is, I'd rather just go afk for an hour or so at night.  Its a serious distraction and makes me feel more than a little blind)

Or you could hit U and click accept - it works as though you actually raised Bodydev stat as you would allocating IP, and thus fills up the new part for you. A majority of the heal I get while ressing comes from 'U -> Click accept'...

Until you do this, your max health is not reset on the server side until either you click accept to calculate the changes in stats as they rise or zone.

And as a Soldier like me who realy likes to PvP, i´m almost dependent too use the "switch" tactic.

This is in no way a detrimental bug to anyone, its just not working as it should (I think).  When a trapped chest goes off with the Blinding effect it is possible to negate it by simply moving as it is going off.  You get the message "Oh no, a bomb" then "nanoprogram aborted".  It seems like the trap forces you to cast the program on yourself and thus moving aborts it.  I like to think of it as jumping back 

Its a silly effect anyway as 15 sec of blindness is only a minor nuisance, especially since you cant open the chest in a fight anyway.

The map is, "of course" gone and lost, so I miss the exit while running out by some 2 rooms more, dying 3 m from the exit door. Such fun! FUN COM or FUn CON? heh 

This one happened to me.  I had spent about 3 hours clearing the mission before this happened lost about 1/3 of my level (97).

I canceled my accounts for the "Can't do jack, it's a feature" response.  I honestly wonder if Funcom even has looked up the word customer service.

Eventually they will realize that instead of having a good game, they have the worst one that still can't even handle stable clients and stable servers.

Obviously you do not have any idea of what you are talking about on this one.. First, I was replying because I am tired of people thinking they are 'better' than someone else just because they have a high speed connection.   Second, my reply was stated VERY sarcastically.  And third, his statement was an insult to another of which I simply came to the defense.

But, let's get back to your point about modems causing lag.  If you knew anything at all about this area you would know that in this type of game and many other online games, modems DO NOT CAUSE lag!   It is the server behind it and the underlying connection BETWEEN the modem and the server.  Games and other applications that are based on client/server design use both the client and the server to process the intensive information.  There is actually very little information passing via the connection.  Not enough to even overload a modem.

The reason large bandwidth connections do better in this situation is not because they are necessarily faster rather they are able to send and recieve MORE information INCLUDING all the errors at one time.   For example when a packet is sent, if that packet contains 100 errors, the DSL can process more of those errors and request new data in a much more large amount than a modem can.

In High error connections, sure a modem will be slower but it is not the modems fault rather it is the connections or server fault for having all those errors in the first place.

If you run a system where no errors are sent or occur, a modem can run just as smoothly as a DSL or any other pipe.

Now if you are running a game or package that requires LARGE amounts of data for transfer, then yes the DSL or cable WILL be much more advantageous because the can handle much more than a modem.  But since we are talking about AO, that is just simply not the case.  The client and the server process everything here and the amount of information going back and forth on this system a modem can handle easily.

AO is not lagging because of modems.  It is lagging because either the servers are not handling the amount of load placed on them or the connection infrastructure is just not able to handle it.

Want proof?  Simple.   Play AO during peek hours of say 6-7pm cst USA time.  Then play again at about 2-3am cst USA time.  BIG difference.  And why?  Because at that time of the morning there is very few people on.  It becomes VERY apparent that once mobs of people log in that the system just cannot handle the load.  

That is NOT people who use modems fault.

Tell you what, it is too bad there is no way to hook you and I together.. DSL directly to my modem.  No one else.  I would play you any game we both can play and know.. And I bet your DSL does you know good when it comes to winning or loosing.  DSL does not make the gamer.  The gamer makes the gamer.

And back to my frustration.  Again I am frustrated at people who start threads like this by insulting someone else. THAT is my frustration.

And moving to the city?  I am not as stupid as you think I am.  I have yet to figure out WHY someone would move to a place of concrete, pollution, noise, crime and all the other things that come with putting millions of humans in one small area.

I can go out back and drink CLEAN water, breath CLEAN air and at night, not a sound.. not a whisper.   And I can leave my doors unlocked if I want to.  I can walk down my street without worrying about being mugged.  Can most in a city do that?

I love it when someone tries to insult 'we country boys'.  You city slickers have no clue what life can really be like.

And since items can't be used from the bank, I cant access the weapons. 

I talked to an ark about this, and he said they are working on it. I hope that means fixing the gfx bug, and not removed all 'noname' items from the game

Bionitrous @ 2/25/2002 10:49:20 PM (9669):
Was going to start a new thread but decided to search and see if the issue was brought up before.

Not sure what it's based on (i.e. Intelligence or Psychic) as I'm not in game right now.  But, I noticed my NanoResist was basically 0(!!) at level 93.  This is just like how NanoPool used to be.

How is it that I'm able to drive a Yalmaha at my level without putting a single point into Vehicle Air, but get none of the same kind of benefits to my NanoResist?

Perhaps it would be less broken and more likely to be invested in if the natural improvements were fixed just like you did for NanoPool.

Silver @ 2/26/2002 2:03:32 AM (11049):
its all very well to say that it isnt Funcoms fault, but when i die without apparently taking any hits then i lay the blame at funcoms door.

either the code they use isnt working properly,

cant cope with the network that it uses, ie the internet,

or its working but is simply not good enuf.

I have played this type of multiplayer game for years, ping isnt really a big issue, and a seconds lag can be coped with, so my own equipment isnt likely to be much of a factor ( within reason) when I die without even registering a hit.

Argue if like that the code being used works well, but i think we all know that is not the case. If that were true the completely unexplained crashes, deaths invisible mobs etc etc would not be happening after 6 months of work.

I am close to calling it a day only because im getting fed up of wasting my time.

Until I played this game almoast all my deaths were my fault, ie I made an error of some kind which lead to my death.

Out of my last 10 deaths, only 2 could i put down to an error ( and even those I could have made good if I could have seen the mob)

All of the others are crashes in a fight, invisible mobs, doors that i suddenly cant get thru and that type of thing.

Not in my view classical lag issues.

This is reality.  This needs to be fixed.  Why even have a statistic, "Nano Resistance," if it's not going to help?  I have only *ONCE* countered a hostile Nano prog, even against a green/yellow, and I always have it maxed out IP-wise.  NPC casters are too powerful, period.

Soozan @ 2/26/2002 3:19:38 AM (12714):
Isn't that the same kinda thing that happened with Voodo 3's and Half-Life?

Hurrah to Nvidia takin' out 3dfx borg style.

Darkblood @ 2/26/2002 3:29:45 AM (12718):
I don't know but it seems only some zones do this.

Sometimes  it remembers my backpack arrangement, sometimes it doesn't.


But this was promised to be fixed many many patches ago. Then promised to be fixed the patch thereafter, then promised to be fixed the patch thereafter, then,.........you get the picture.

sometimes happens in reclaim too. Wierd...it *used* to be OK....

Meligant @ 2/26/2002 3:41:52 AM (12718):
I want to know why it only seems to happen when I go into the Superior shops in Omni Trade.  WTH..is there some sort of anti-omni sentiment going around the office?

Soozan @ 2/26/2002 3:46:37 AM (11049):
Okay, you said that you're sick of people thinking they're better than you because they have a faster connection.  However, what the hell is this?

*GASP!*  Are you generalizing a populous?  Just because we chose to live in a larger city we're not intelligent?  Hmmm.

Um.  It REALLY isn't the server's fault.  Take any multiplayer game.  Connect to a server and play using a modem.  Connect to the same server with DSL or a cable connection.  I gaurantee you will see improvement.  So this is no insult to you in any way, but a LARGE portion of the lag you are experiancing may be the result of your modem.

Also, one of the main hold-ups I experiance during populated hours is the GRAPHICAL loading of the characters.  Each character looks different, moves independently, and requires a lot of power to process.  The only difference I ever experiance is the loading of the areas where there are large congregations of people.  And think about this.  The server has to send you information about what each person is wearing, what action they are doing, what direction they are moving, what buffs they are running.  That's a lot of information... do you really think that a 56kbps modem (if they ever ran that fast, ever wonder why you never download from anywhere at the advertised 56k/sec?) can EASILY handle that?  Tell me what system could!

You never played Half-Life did you.  You never noticed that when you pressed "fire" it took a noticable time for it to actually fire.  There certainly was a reason why LPB's were refered to as "Low Ping Bastads."  When they fired a bullet, it went were it was aimed, when a modem user fired they had to anticipate where they would move in the next second.  There certainly is "more skill" involved in modem gaming, but that's because of the modem's downfalls.

Also, since the "bug" is the latency, can you HONESTLY tell me that a modem helps you in the least?  It IS the modems fault.  It is all of our faults for not having T1 lines installed!

Oh wait, you're right, it is funcom's fault.  I suggest we just turn the game into 2D side scroller.  That would solve everything!

So enjoy sulking in your bitterness.

NOTE:  During busy server times everyone will lag.  That's life.

OK, on a guild hunt to TLR dung and the client crashed EVERY time I entered, but is fine in all other zones.
Has anyone else had this happen to them?

I'm tired of wearing a skirt!  I'm not even Scottish!

Maximilian @ 2/26/2002 3:20:43 PM (Please restart the cycling in the 'Computer' terminals 12885):
in the (neutral) speciality shops in Borealis and Newland. I continously check these two terminals (only the Comp terminals) for a couple of days now, and there is absolutely no change in the items offered. The other terminals in the shop (cars, furniture, buffs) do change.

To my knowledge these are the only affected terminals, but heaven knows.

Thanks in advance,

Max(imilian)

I have recently heard that Psychic is not adding to Nano Resistance, if that is the case then that is probably what is behind the complete ineffectiveness of Nano Resistance. Unfortunately Funcom continues to be silent on this and almost every other issue.

Scorus

Silver @ 2/26/2002 5:01:23 PM (11768):
Certainly these types of issues are the least bearable for me.

To have spent an hour or more fighting to a point in a mission and then some 'feature' causes the mission to repopulate leaving u mapless, petless and in a room with an agroing mob isnt encouraging me to keep playing.

For non pet classes it may not be as serious, or fatal. Damn but its annoying.

Also the exp loss over the last few days due to this type of thing is about a levels worth, over 4 mil.

Seid @ 2/26/2002 5:23:30 PM (12718):
Hmm. Since FC cant eradicate the container gnomes, maybe they should let em out as MOB's ?  

I would sure like to nuke some.

And BUMP

Seid @ 2/26/2002 5:26:46 PM (12543):
I also heard you should not "look" at the item before delivering it. Have not tried to confirm this recently, as missions take a long time now.

So for now : Use bags to make room for the item in the main inv until delivered, and dont "look" at it.

Seid @ 2/26/2002 5:29:30 PM (11768):
When driving keep your aggro bar below 50%. The first aid kits seem to work in a vehicle if you are not "attacking". Also try pressing ESC to cancel attacks in progress.

Nrse @ 2/26/2002 6:55:54 PM (Mort Dungeon Bug 12906):
Ok this has happend to me twice in a row.  I have been in the dungeon with a team and all of a sudden I start taking damage from a unknow source and before I can react I die, after all I am only a doc.  Is anyone else haveing this problem?

Meligant @ 2/26/2002 7:07:11 PM (12906):
If you mean the Mort Static Dungeons just north of the zone from MMD then I think it has something to do with the 75% zone gas pocket out there. *shrug*

Nrse @ 2/26/2002 7:19:36 PM (12906):
Yeah I am talking about the dungeons by the op, just pisses me off when I loose 30ok and don't have a chance to run or anything.  Besides they aleays seem to aggro me.  I'm a doc, go figure.....

MuscularBeaver @ 2/26/2002 7:50:24 PM (11998):
If they fix Broken Shores, won't they have to rename it Fixed Shores?

Photeus @ 2/27/2002 1:41:47 AM (Joith Guns!! 12954):
They dont work. At all. With only 6 rounds in them and the disadvantage of losing any damage output associated with a weapon i feel that you could at least make this gun work SOMETIMES. Ive reported this several times with no response. Its a small thing. Its not like im asking you to do anything amazing, just deliver the weapon as it was meant to be. a slow gun that procs a lowbie trader root with no damage is hardly overpowering.

Khayne @ 2/27/2002 4:31:47 AM (12718):
Damn, container gnomes seems harder to eradicate than leets...

Soon there will probably be container gnome dolls too, and people will start to speak out for gnome rights.

(read: KILL CONTAINER GNOMES NOW! Its been WAAAAAY too long.)

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 9:01:41 AM (12718):
If I wasn't "certifiably" crazy anyway This would Drive me to insanity.  Seriously my neighbors are becoming really afraid of me.  I go into fits of screaming and throwing things around because of this game.  Mostly when the game crashes and deletes some of my items, or I get hit by "Insta-Death"... but it also happens when the Inventory Gnomes Strike!  And that thankfully happens far more often than the other two or I would probably be serving a 20-year sentence for aggravated homicide.

In any case they (FunCom) have said they will eliminate this...  When?  Well my best guess would be one of the following -
A).  When they finally employ someone who know how to write decent code.
B).  Just before they go out of business... in a last ditch attempt to sell the game rights to some other "loser company" that will then allow it to go to "hell in a hand basket".
C).  Never because they will be too busy making "gameplay ajustments"  

Maybe they should change the name of their company to "FUCom"!?!

Hextorr @ 2/27/2002 9:02:48 AM (3 very serious Bugs 12979):
I'm lvl 170 Fixer maxed abilities maxed evades/resist 120 Token board ql200 everything except scope (ql134)

#1
last 3 pvp fights, i got crited 90% of the time and my adversary shot me FAST!!!! doc 176, agent 165 (with scope he should shoot slow) and trader 101... i am lvl 170 with close to 900 evades all arround my guess is my evades are not beeing calculated, this is very serious, happened different days in diferent zones with different people of different lvls of different professions, and has happen before too, but these three were on a row!

Also against some mobs it seems that going full deff on the aggro bar makes no difference i ghet hit as often adn very fast... somethign VERY WRONG!

#2
another bug is when you go out of visual range of a MOB or player you are fighting then you cant hit them back anymore... very easy to reproduce, start a fight run away, run back and see what happpens (you also get a message "attacked by none")

#3
even with my maxed nano resist i cannot resist ANYTHING!!! i ran a mission for a friend, ql90 i resist 0!!! nano spells 0!!! zero!!!

Runnign a ql120 mission for a nano i needed i died CHIAIN ROOTED i resisted 0!!! zero!!! nanos...

went with my guild to Steps of madness, mobs droping loot ql20ish i spent 3 hours in there getting several coats for the people in our guild that needed i reisted the grand total of one!!! 1!!! one!!! nano during those 3 hours.. these are mobs that drop ql20ish items im lvl 170 for cripes sake

and resist in pvp... big joke, i resist 0!!! nada niente zycles nothing.

something VERY WRONG!!!

so wth did i max all my evades and resist for?! they dont work

Hextorr @ 2/27/2002 9:20:26 AM (12718):
yes and it is seriously hurting my thrust in FC as a professional company, in any other client-compnay relation they would be FIRED!!
the gnomes are still very much here. exemples
#1
you decide to buy a few more first aid healing kits before your old ones are spent so you go to the shop and buy them, you are in the mission adn you use all your kits from the old set so now you move the new ones to the slot where your old ones were, uppon zoning it all gets messed up.

step one
slot #1(lockpick) #2(ammo) #3(old kits) #4(chargers) #5(new kits)

then you spend all your old kits and move the new ones to slot #3 so you get

slot #1(lockpick) #2(ammo) #3(new kits) #4(chargers)

then you zone and you get

slot #1(lockpick) #2(ammo) #3(chargers) #4(new kits)

and sometimes i dont know exacly when it will mess with your inventory regardless of anything.

i want the game to save my inventory position each time i manualy rearange it (make a save key you press?) or everytime i zone save my current state do not store items by the order i pick them up!!!!!!!!!! damn your inventory programmers suck big time!!!

FIRE YOUR INVENTORY PROGRAMMERS NOW!! THEY ARE HURTING YOUR CREDABILITY HAS A SERIOUS AND PROFETIONAL COMPANY!

Hextorr @ 2/27/2002 9:41:05 AM (11768):
stop for a split second after using the kit, it on ly kicks in after you stop moving for a split second.

I'm with you on all the rest

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 9:44:34 AM (12979):
Yeah I've known about this for quite some time.   It would be nice to have a "skill" produce some result.  Otherwise where's that IP reset FunCom was talking about????  I WANT MY IP BACK!!!!

Hextorr @ 2/27/2002 9:49:23 AM (12350):
Lvl 170, maxed abilities including psy and int, maxed nano resist, and i think i throwed in a couple ql200 implants, anyway i ran a lvl 90 mission for a fried i resisted nada, i ran aql120ish mission for a nano i needed i resisted nada! i went with my guild to Steps of madness, spent 3 hours in there to get coats for people who needed them in those 3 hours against mobs that drop ql 20ish or so loot i resisted the grand total of 1 (one) nanospell!!!

NANO RESIST DOES NOT WORK, PERIODE!

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 10:14:25 AM (11049):
I have a cable modem.  I play in the early hours of the morning to avoid "local" causes for "packet loss".  All of my characters are on RK1.  I have had numerous incidents of this nature.  In most cases the fight is over I heal up then WHAMMOO I'm dead.  I'm not having any of the other symptoms of "lag".  I can notice those almost instantly... but then am left in terror.  Because there is nothing I can do and I have no idea how bad the consequences will be.  (I've lost bags full of valuable stuff and money as well as XP!!)  So I would rule out Lag as being the cause.  And it seems to happen more frequently in zones that are sparsely populated so that also suggests something other than "lag".

I'd almost say that this game "calculates" that a character should die and just kills them.  It's a random thing.  I had a level 18 character that was close to leveling.  She went to Omni HQ to help a lower level player finish a mission.  She is an MP and didn't team with the other character - just put a heal pet on him and tagged along.  When we got done we went back to the gate.  My MP had switched to Social Armor and only had a heal pet active which was under command to heal her - as zoning caused you to take damage from your implants (as in the game didn't calculate your implant bonuses).  When "out of the Blue" the Elite Guard killed my character instantly.  I lost the entire levels worth of XP.  And the "cause" was never explained to me!!  BTW this was that character's first trip to the reclaim booth. 

You can argue about the use of modems... I don't care.  I sincerely don't think the issue has anything to do with lag.  All I do know is that it makes people not want to play AO.  If FunCom wants people to play their game then they need to address the issue.  Somehow I don't think they care!

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 10:33:12 AM (11768):
I travel dangerous zones in Reet-form. Most of the speed bonus of a Kodiak and uses IP I will spend anyway.  I get attacked fly past until I am not under attack and stop.  No First Aid kits don't work.... Treatment Kits don't either!?!  Drop Reet-form and the first aid kit I tried 4 times before hits instantly.

Mind you I used to be able to heal "on the fly" or "on the run".  But not anymore!!    Some "genius" decided this wasn't "fair" for some reason.  And now I can't heal at all while in Reet-form.  Which IMO is really stupid.


Otherwise I really don't care about the XP loss.  I terminate out of a lot of my missions because I don't want to level up without making any credits.   And I can't afford to upgrade my implants, weapons and armor.  So it's a better choice to volintarilly stay where I'm at till I can make some money.  For some reason FunCom doesn't seem to want players to do that???  It makes me wonder if some of them aren't making some money on the side - selling credits on Ebay?

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 10:44:32 AM (12633):
Umm... I'm not the authority on anything in particular.  So my opinion doesn't really count.  But I don't think Notum Vipers and Speckeled Bloodcreepers have any nano skills let alone nanos.  It doesn't make sense that they would.  So WTF is going on here seems to be an obvious "bug" in the database.  And constitues another example of FunCom's complete lack of professionalism.  The sad thing is they will probably fix this before they do any of the "serious bugs" like Insta-Death or Items/Credits being deleted in client disconnects.

Ladeda @ 2/27/2002 10:57:49 AM (12747):
this is a result of FunCom trying to stop an "exploit" - namely Enfs that use Hammers from tapping the Q key to recycle their weapon's recharge.  It affects all of us in a number of ways.  I have the result with both of my Melee characters.  It forces an "unnatural" delay between special attacks and even delays between fights.  I comes down to the server not being able to keep up with your fight.  So it doesn't know that one fight, or special attack, has ended and won't let you use the next.  However, in this case, since the first weapon's recharge has not cycled it is waiting for that to happen before it will allow you to switch weapons.  Really Stupid IMO!! But that's "FunCom" - go figure.   And if you could find someone smart enough to figure this out - they'd never admit it.  So stick with the Nova!

Chill @ 2/27/2002 12:32:10 PM (biomech armor treatment & 1st aid bonus 13004):
It's still not working.
Why didn't you fix it when you did the omni med pants?

I thought at first it was a display bug in the skills screen but no because when I tried to put an implant with a treatment req above my natural treatment + clinic bonus (100) it wouldn't fit in as it should have if the treatment bonus from the biomech armor parts I was wearing worked.

Fix this bug ASAP.
It's about the 4th time I make a post about it since the release last july and still no answer.

I'd rather have a bug free game than a couple extra static dungeons/missions (I can't believe fixing some small bugs takes more time than designing a whole new dungeon).
Fixing bugs should be the top priority.

Chill @ 2/27/2002 12:35:04 PM (9669):
It's based on psychic.

BUMP.

No more new dungeons, fix all the annoying bugs first!!!!

Traumatizer @ 2/27/2002 12:48:33 PM (Animation Bug BBS armors 13007):
There is a kind of graphical bug in the animations of the Battle Suit Armors. Your weapons aren't drawn and when you fight, you fight as if using hand to hand combat, even though you have a weapon equiped. I have only experience with the nova flow rifle...but I have seen it on two different occasions.
 
Do anybody else experience this bug?

With other weapons fx. meele?

Or is only nova flow users who got this bug?

Further more; you can't execute socialmoves in the BBS

Krazakraith @ 2/27/2002 3:05:47 PM (Dupe Bug 13038):
I didn't save before i arenaed and after i died, a couple items appeared both on my corpse(my opponent looted them) and in the reclaim terminal.  I though about this, and what if you made 10 backpacks full of bloodplasma, didn't save, and arenaed someone, sold the plasma, arenaed, sold the plasma, arenaed, sold the plasmal, etc. this seems to be a very fast way to get credits, and then say perhaps...sell it on ebay or something?

Zeroshift @ 2/27/2002 3:29:09 PM (13038):
You dumbass. you don't post this sh!t out in the open. 

Now delete this post and go post it on the EXPLOITS forum.

Odac @ 2/27/2002 3:33:47 PM (12718):
I'm sure they will fix this just as soon as they fix the lag.


-Bump-

dropcid @ 2/27/2002 3:35:42 PM (13038):
Just so you know, it's doesn't work anyway.
Once you take an item off you body, it won't be in the reclaim... and vice versa.

-D

Silver @ 2/27/2002 3:46:55 PM (12633):
The likely hood is that it was a stun or somesuch, many of the effects following attacks seem to be nanos, stunned by a brawl seems to be one of them, and there are bound to be others

Scorus @ 2/27/2002 3:54:05 PM (13038):
The early versions on test had this bug but I justed tested it on 13.5 and the bug is no longer there. You now lose everything that was looted off you and NODROP items cannot be looted.

Griefers rejoice, the game has devolved for you.

Scorus

Cloudeh @ 2/27/2002 4:18:57 PM (13038):
Im just waiting for a big ****ING huge ****up where SOMEONE will post saying ALL there stuff except nodrop was looted.

Its going to happen I can feel it

Krazakraith @ 2/27/2002 8:39:43 PM (13038):
The item that got duplicated was a nanocrystal i recieved as a mission reward, a lock pick was also duplicated, and i did sell the extra items to a shop, so this bug is an exploit, and as for being a dumbass for posting it here, maybe that's because it's a major issue that needs to be fixed, not kept on the hush hush


I for one am tired of all the cheaters and exploiters running around, ppl are even trying to sell guides to the way they cheat on ebay, it's time something is done funcom

MAYBE this was a one time freak occurance, maybe...but still there are dupe bugs being used, just check ebay

You hit that one right on...   All this does is make it so people do not want to play AO..   And if I said I was one of those, someone would tell me to go away.   

And to those other people reading this that would say go away, you know if I did go away and all those others that some tell to go away, DO go away...  well then the rest of you will not have ANY Anarchy Online to play because most of us will have gone away causing AO to shut down.

Look at Ultima Online.  It almost died because of the very same issues.   Even today it survives barely but not even close to what it once was.   Is that what everyone wants for AO?  Because if so, many of us being told to go away will do just that and you can then complain to an empty gamespace about why no one is online anymore.

And again, it is NOT the modems fault.  Did you read what I posted?  

The REASON you are having better through put is because your DSL or cable can process MORE ERRORS faster than a modem!!!!

Your DSL or cable can request a new packet for every error much faster than a modem.. that is obvious.    Get rid of the errors and guess what?  The modem can process the information for the game as fast as the dsl.. just not as much of it.

So yes, if you put 100 players in the same area, you may get a slight speed decrease on a modem than you would DSL or cable BUT as long as there are no errors in the data stream, there still would be no noticable decrease in gameplay speed.

Now, we could all move to DSL and cable (if that were possible) but the errors would still be there and eventually a limit would be reached even with users all on DSL and Cable.... and you would see the same problem..  Then what are you going to blame?

NOTE:  During busy server times everyone will lag.  That's life. 
			
		
	
Never played Half-life so don't know about that.

But I am a engineer, hardware and code and I can tell you that you are wrong.   I HAVE and DO design systems that have a MUCH HIGHER load on them than ANY online gaming system has ever come up with.  And some clients MUST use modems because they are on laptops in the field.    And you know something?   Our systems do not have this problem.   And in fact, if they did, people would loose their lives for REAL.

Look at it from this point.  A 56K modem can transfer 56,000 bits of information PER SECOND.   That is a lot of information in computer terms.  Usually it is done in packets with each packet containing the next in a long string of information.. all of it 1's and 0's.    As long as that stream is not interrupted, information flies.  When it is disrupted, the packet has to be resent.   When a packet is resent, that is known as lag.

Plus a server will NOT send more information than the other end can receive at once.  In other words, a server is not going to send a modem a packet that is 56,000,000 bits long all at once because it knows it cannot handle it.  The modem requests and tells the server what to send and the server does.  And it all happens faster than you can imagine.

In online games, usually they SET packets to a certain size.. ONE size for all packets.  This is why they say the game can be played with 56K modems.  Because they have designed the data stream and the packets to contain what information is required and since the information required to play the game fits into that size stream, a modem can handle it IF there is no interruption of that stream.

The problem is NOT modems or dsl or anything else.  It is the infrastructure between the user and the server.  Whether it is the code on the server, the server itself, the routers or the connecting fiber or coax cabling between the two locations, something is causing the problem.  NOT the users modems.

If I can send information to modems that is critical to someone life WITHOUT error or lag or loss of data, then others can also.  And IF I can send REAL TIME DATA INCLUDING VIDEO over 56K that someones life depends on, then game development companies can do so also.

There is no argument in the world that will change that because I do it every single day.

Routeen @ 2/27/2002 9:56:17 PM (New calm bug 13167):
Casting mobs now break calms when they cast nanos -- this is particularly pronounced with trader and mps, but it is not confined to them.

This makes crowd control difficult, to say the least.

I had one trader break my calm 11 times in a row... it is a consistent problem, and needs immediate attention.

Guest @ 2/27/2002 11:33:26 PM (My Character stuck.  A bug? 13207):
Hello, 

My second level Martial Artist, Kwambiri, has fallen behind the surgery clinic after getting her appartment in the Omni backyard-1.  Pretty damn funny, the first time, but this has happened to me twice.  I just leave the apt to go get a mission, and leap off the edge, as any normal player would, to find myself trapped behind some machine.  There must be a way to get out?  Is this a bug?  This is maddening, please assist.

Thank you in advance.

Altaire @ 2/27/2002 11:45:21 PM (Uncastable Nano 13211):
Warp Time and Space : Rome doesn't work for my toon. 

My toon meets the requirements for the nano, but it wont cast. No animation, just a message saying I'm casting it, but nothing happens at all. There is no little casting meter (used to have to watch it for about a minute and a half since it takes so long).

I petitioned once before about it, and a GM helped my toon cast it again, but after my next playing session it was broke again.

Anyone else ever see this bug ???

I wish I could just get rid of the darn nano and get a new one. Once you upload it, it is gone and you cant remove it from the program list.

Deepeyes6 @ 2/28/2002 7:12:07 AM (Punching while wielding a gun 13277):
This bug has been listed several times in the patch 13.8 forums (and even last week by Noer) but since it hasn't received any comment yet from Funcom I feel that I should post it here as well.  

While trying to fix the MA ability to punch while wielding a weapon, Funcom inadvertently caused other professions to do the same.  This means characters like traders who rely on divests/plunders during battle will automatically start punching when trying to shoot b/c their ma skill got boosted.  Also any other character who happens to have 120+ ma skill due to a high agility and sense will start to punch during shots.  What this does is it interupts our shooting because our gun cycle has to wait for our melee cycle to complete.  Many people who use low light scopes have a huge negative phys init and that means when they punch, they punch really slow.  So instead of shooting once every 2-3 seconds, they now shoot once every 6 seconds with bouts of minimum dmg in between due to their fists.  

Funcom please address this issue immediately because it is ruining the playability of many gamers.  I do not want the MA's ability to wield weapons and punch to be nerfed but punching while shooting for other professions has got to be eliminated.  

If you want more proof please read this:

Is this only me or did it happen to someone else as well? My aggro slider repositions itself after zoning. But this time it goes to a position a few clicks below full aggro.

Very annyoing when you need full aggro (team healer as Adv) - you have to readjust every time. Could you please have a look at this and correct it as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Xldoc @ 2/28/2002 1:18:18 PM (Bug after the 13.8 patch 13328):
Hello, first i want to congratulate the dev team for all new patch that render the game more pleasant.
However i have a problem with the reclaim booth
When i died yesterday i forgot to take all my remains.
i came back after 5 minutes and i ll tried to take back my stuff, what a surprise , i open the reclaim booth and i saw all my old item that i have in my bag , i tried to click on it but the object seems to disapear/reappear.
I make /terminate for triing to take back my items from my corpse but no way the reclaim booth have my object yet.
I tried to go to the bank and let all my object there but now in my bank i have 8 bags of the same type instead of one!
And the reclaim booth is not empty anyway.

I am really disapointed 
and the deception doesn't finish here , i try to make some mission all my team mates went in but i had the message " server unable..." i make back the try about 10 times to enter the missions.

I send a report to Funcom but like all the time when i sent a report i don t know if someone work in that bug.

I tried to make a /petition but the wait convince me to delog

ryu1313 @ 2/28/2002 3:06:15 PM (12979):
Agent 165 (with scope he should shoot slow)
			
		
	

Since he is high level he's probaby maxed ranged-int so you figure a scope would take that back down. True. However there is a unique agent only scope that actually adds ranged-int (as well as a bunch of other useful stuff). He's probably got that with his high ranged int which is why he's shooting that fast.

Specie @ 2/28/2002 3:34:49 PM (Name selection bug (never fixed) 13348):
Dont know if this has been up before but since it has been in the game since the launch and never been fixed ill take it up anyway.

When selecting a Nickname the characters Full Name also changes. I dont think it should be like this since it makes it impossible to give a character a nickname based on his full name.

This should be a fairly easy bug to fix too I think.

slimebot @ 2/28/2002 3:36:52 PM (looting mobs in walls 13349):
Most mobs fall where they are killed... and if they aren't bugged and halfway into a wall already, they usually fall somewhere that it is easy to loot them.  However, Fatesteelers (Lifebleeders and others like them) seem to be thrown back by the force of the last attack on them and often get put way back into a wall.  Why is there collision detection on them when they are alive and then the body can go anywhere it pleases when they die?  Where's the collision detection there?  Not only that, but now it is impossible to sit next to the wall and try and look into it to loot the body like you used to be able to do with the /pray move (or something like that). 

I'm very tired of wasting my time killing hard mobs like Fatesteelers only to be denied of the loot.

slimebot @ 2/28/2002 4:06:21 PM (agg/def slider constantly on the move! 13362):
Whenever I zone, I have to recheck my agg/def slider since it is MOVING ON IT'S OWN toward defense!  "Hmmm, why am I so slow today," I think.  The answer would be that my slider now has a mind of it's own and is deciding for me at every zone.  Please fix this SOON!

edit:  I just noticed that Maximilian has the same post as this already in the forum here, but what the heck, this is a pretty bad bug.

It get's worse I scanned before I loged the last time I was on and scaned soon as I loged on guess what I lost 1 mil exp.

I know what some of you are going to say, as did my friends last night send a petit, nope I'm not this is the best way to fix my problem.

I will edit this message with updates each time i'll find new troubles... 


BUGS & TROUBLES SINCE PATCH 13.8 / 13.9: 
-------------------------------------------------

(Mobs Issues)
- Mobs always execute InstaNuke & InstaDebuff at the same time they shoot us with their ranged/melee weapons
- Trader Mobs level 120 can cast instanuke (DD of 1400 DAM) at the same time of Plunder Skill and Root ! (Broken Shore Mission ~QL120)
- Mobs cast nuke without any graphic animation, so we only know they cast something when we're dead (i'm ironical)
- Much more mobs fall in walls when dieing than before. They're impossible to loot. 
- Mobs die, but no XP is rewarded. No message at all. 5% of the kills in some missions.
- No logical check in fight steps: mob die - mob still stand up - mob fight
- Mobs die for no reason - XP is gain (cool) - plz dont fix that bug 
- Mobs break Calm Project in casting a nano on themself
- I confirm some Traders have DD Nanos, not a health funnel (1400 DD of Energy Damage), maybe an hybrid profession NT/Trader

(Display/Calculation Errors)
- There is a lack of synchronism between the yellow XP Message gain from a mob and his real death (the mob continue to hit us after his death, i think this is because the information packets (of the victory) reach our client before the damage info packets. 
- All Biomech Armor Cloaks are not graphically cloaks anymore, just a second ugly body armor (instead of a nano robe design).
- Yalmaha are sometimes marked as red and dont give any speed run bonus. Instead of this, they negate the run speed skill when put off. 
- Invisible Walls in Tir prevent us to jump over/fly over them. Flying or Jumping is now boring instead to be funny. 
- Some professions use fists instead of melee/ranged weapon (and do ridiculous damage, urgent need to fix it)
- The ceiling in mission is virtually less high than before the patch, there is a graphic glitch when we jump. Why have you touch to this, it was perfect with the patch 13.7 !
- There is a big problem with a switch of points in Map Navigation and Vehicule Air Skills. You put IP in V-Air, and after zoning, points were distributed in Map Nav ! GM cant do anything to reemburse !
- Reclaim booth is bugged. Sometimes, items are impossible to transfer into the inventory.
- Sometimes the displayed target is not really targeted, so when we want to heal or fight the target, no action is performed. Often with no feedback at all to explain the trouble. 
- Count of used NCUs is bugged. We need to zone to refresh the exact value of free NCUs !
- Sometimes when we die, we respawn at the exit of the mission area, we have to go to the reclaim to pick up stuff (XP Lost)

(Lag/Server Issues)
- Broken Shore is more laggy than it never been before (zoning is very longer than before in all areas)
- Broken Shore crash often (i didnt crash before patch 13.6)
- After a crash, we have to tell an ARK to unstuck us because our character is (sometimes, scarcer) crashing just after the log in. 
- Bags take too much time to open. Very often, one click is not suffisant to open them. 
- After a server crash, all mobs are respawning. You're surrounded by them and killed when you log in. Please, in case of server crash, make us respawn outside the mission area !

(Nanos)
- When will we be able to break a useless root ? Rooted for 8 minutes with no mobs in the mission area is a little boring (Sarcasm). 
- Rage Line of Enforcer Nanos dont break root anymore. Is it intended ?
- NT Nano Warp Time and Space: Rome dont work
- Humidity Extractor last one hour, but give nanos only during 30 minutes. Is it intended ? I'm not sure, lol.
- Project Calm is broken, mobs can break it on any nano casting.

(Pet problems)
- Pets dont respond to owner after several fights (no feedback in the chat box). This occurs in crowded spots or mission with more than 2 members in the team, and/or several pets

(Items)
- Biomech armors add FA/TR Bonus only on doctors
- Items with no MA prerequisite cause your character to use fists in fight
- Shops dont randomize the QL of some items anymore. Very annoying for the exact QL we look for. 
- The treasure randomizer seems to have an extraordinary interest in spawning Information Tools, Maps and other useless items... Grrr...




OLD ISSUES: 
----------------- 

- On the team list, bargraphs are always wrong (after to be apart), we constantly need to refresh (F1,F2,F3,F4,F5,F6) them to read the real value. 
- Always the famous issue of people who are invisible because they didnt follow the team to enter a big room (No heal possible).
- On the team list, nano bargraph is always wrong, even after a refresh. So we can see our sat teammates waiting for nano recharge although they have 100% on the screen. 
- Sometimes, when a MA use an ? nanos, his barlife cant reach 100% (red bargraph) on the doc team list. The doc continue to heal the MA without any reason, wasting his nanos. 
- Impossibility to rename organisations with colored text 
- Impossibility to change the color of the Nano Contextual Messages (same green than Guild Channel) 
- Always the problem of warping back when run toward water (Dont Run into the water !)
- Always the problem of "You were attacked by -NONE-" when fleeing a fight (NPC able to nuke you through walls from 5 rooms away).
- Overflow inventory dont work in many situations (Weapon dropped 'cause no ammo, Trade Declined), object lost !
- If you miss the backpack from some pixels, you put your item on the ground, when you watch for it, it has disappeared, definatly, doh ! (it happens when the floor has a slight slope, or near the surgery clinic). 
- Use of the shop surgery clinic doesn't work twice without zoning (even after 10 minutes)
- Sometimes, same faction NPC attack us (Team 100% of the same faction) without have been previously provocated (No Witness)
- The exploit to control guard people against player of the same faction in town always work. 
- Some Reflect Bracers dont work, they didnt do it anyway. 
- My Agent enters the game in walk mode. Not my two other characters, why ? Maybe make an AutoRun option. 
- Sneak mode ('H' Key) sometimes block until we zone, in my case, i can use it once by area when this phenomena occurs (unkown cause).
- When you reach a grid exit without having the CL prerequisite, you might be stucked in the pyramidal structure basement (GM needed) 
- During the resurrection shock period, sometimes, the first aid kit do 10% of his normal efficientness. A 100-115 HP heal kit do 10-12... strange a lot! Seems to have a malfunction between the Actual Skill Values (in Red) and the Prerequisite of the Kit. 
- Why the "ClientR.exe Process" always saturate the memory of our PC after having play a long time ? Dont you know how to wipe the memory  regularly ? 
- Some Engineer's Pet Nanos dont have same Nano Skill requirements for the shell creation and to use the shell. Could you adjust this, some 3 points are ridiculous.
- Reet Shape (On Others) debuff after zoning. Is it intended ?
- Inventory always shuffle after exiting some shops (Dont have the exact location, not observe it myself).


ALWAYS NEEDED: 
----------------------- 

- Need to prevent the map reset after quiting a mission area (maybe create a local data file ?) 
- Need to have a shortcut for the slider (Aggro-Def), Stat View is too big 
- Need to have a shortcut to fast reload both weapons 
- When noone is selected, make the heal & nanos kits go on ourself (grrrr, so stupid to do nothing) 
- More small cheap backpacks without any bonus at all (Guild Banks are always a big mess of stuff!) 
- Make the pet log out with his owner. AO is unstable (yes it's worse than before), so, many relog and reboot are necessary. Build a Pet is not cheap, not easy, not fun at all when you have to relog in (or have been "Link Dead" reported). 
- A hotkey to paste the posxy coordinates into the chat line
- Need to help NPCs in trouble with enemies
- Need to change the faction on some Outposts after a long siege by the opposite faction (guards killed, a kind of capture the flag rule, ...).
- When in the same team, TAB must target enemy mobs or players outside of the team, not teammates of the opposite faction (and their pets)
- Need a new option (F10 - Visual) to opacify (or render black) the background of the chat box. Very very annoying with LLS or NVG, in white rooms and deserts.

Bye.

Scorus @ 2/28/2002 8:31:23 PM (13419):
For some characters, a Yalmaha will become 'red' (as if you were indoors) whenever you zone. I don't know when it started, it has been true for me since I got my Yalm around 13.4. After you zone, you are no longer in your Yalm and your Run Speed returns to normal. When you unequip the Yalm, the Run Speed bonus from the Yalm is subtracted even though it was not added before and your run speed goes negative. Reequipping brings the run speed back up to normal but does not give the Yalm bonus.

This only happens in my Yalm, not in my cars. It slows me down and prevents quick getaways from missions in dangerous areas. FIX IT!

Darkbane @ 2/28/2002 9:17:04 PM (11049):
You don't say how your users use their modems, if they dial into your servers, then you probably can do everything you say. The internet is a rather different setup though...

And packet loss isn't lag, though the effects can be simillar. Games such as Half-Life minimise the effects of packet loss byNOT resending data, but using client side prediction and maintaining the master state only on the server. The server is the 'real' world, the client is only ever an approximation. This helps with lag (delays in transmission) aswell, but leads to 'jumping' when the server manages to update the client, and prevents different clients from agreeing on the game state at any given time.

Your discussion is pretty accurate in all other respects.

From what I've read, AO uses TCP which isn't a very good idea for internet online gaming in real-time or near real-time, and I suspect a lot of the problems relate to that. i've no idea of the details of AO's network infrastructure so can't comment further.

Level 112 enforcer. He is punching and the timing on the hammer is messed up. I feel like the bug where you can not fight without moving, except now it is at the beginning of the fight not the end. 
His damage varies from very low to very high. It isn't fun to play him any more so I will put him down until this is fixed and play another character that is fun. 

Please fix and roll out to the server  ASAP Funcom. This patch for me is like 12.6 . I keep getting hit and am not hitting back.

Any news about this? The kits are still broken, and my guild's all like, "Hey, can you make a 1HE for me?" I'd love to, but the option's just not there.

Physto @ 3/1/2002 7:51:59 AM (Watch your Yalm closely! 13570):
I lost my Yalm today... a Yalm that I have been using for a couple months now.

I'm not sure exactly what happened, but while re-arranging my inventory, it disappeared.

Anyway... so I /petitioned... waited for 45 minutes to talk to a very nice ARK who told me he was going to up it to a GM.

I waited another 45 minutes or so for a GM to /tell me.  When he did, I explained the situation, and he told me "Ok.  I just need to go look in the logs.  This will take a minute."

A couple minutes later, he came back and told me "It wasn't in the logs so I can't reemburse you."

We talked about this for several minutes (yes, I have screenshots), during which time I was told that the logs are very inaccurate (yes, I have him saying that in a screenshot), and that there was nothing he could do.

I asked him if it gets logged when I save... or when I logout... or when I GOT the plane... I was told that indeed these events are logged.  But not in my case.  

Ok.  So it's just a plane.  Just a plane???  I'm a level 41 enforcer who plays mostly solo.  I found this plane in a chest after doing hundreds of repair missions with the hopes of finding one.  I finally did, and I was thrilled.  Lucky, sure.  I won the lottery.  But I worked like hell for that chance.

Now it's gone.  I have about 70k credits to my name, and there's no WAY I will make enough money to buy a new one.  Missions are tough enough now where I don't want to waste another 3-4 months of my life running repair missions hoping to win the lottery AGAIN.

Hrm.

I'm trying very hard not to whine... but the truth is... your planes aren't safe.  Planes were supposed to be one of the most logged items of the game, and there's no record of the plane I have been using for months...?  

Be careful, folks.  

As for me... I just cancelled my account.  I can't stand the fact that in a few seconds, months of work has been erased, and there's nothing they can do about it.

This game has had so many problems.

Funcom: fix your logs.  And gimme back my plane.

oldfartma @ 3/1/2002 9:18:46 AM (IP bug that happened to me today 13578):
I began my day by loggin on my 64 MA to see I do alittle better but monsters seem to be hitting eather harder or faster as Im losing hp faster while fighting them so I do a /petition to ask if this is intended so after a couple missions I level Ive been saving my extra ip for the level 62 yalmaha I found the other night to replace my ql 30 yalmaha I put the 221 points into vehicle air already had 89 from my ql 30 one I zone out and try and put it on it tells me I need a minum of 221 vehicle air so Im like WTH....then I look at navigation and I have 221 map navigation?! im like WTF anways the gm finally contacts me about my earlyer petition and I ask about the monster damage and tell him/her about the bug with me putting 221 ip into vehicle air and when I zoned it was in map navigation he/she tells me to send a email with what happened I did so then I logged back in to notify the GM that I did he/she said he/she would report the bug and I asked if I was gonna be SOL on 24+K IP he/she said that he/she would see what could be done but wasnt making any promises. I really really hope they do somthing about this as I just got back from taking 8 months off AO due to bugs been back a week and already slapped with another bug.

Rage is now broken!  Please fix it back to pre 13.8 status.

Obitus @ 3/1/2002 11:11:55 AM (Rage Is Broken! 13590):
Enforcers have always accepted the fact that the Rage line of nanos did work as advertised.  "remove all hostile nanos"  We accepted this because the thing that Rage did great was break roots/slows.  This has now been broken with 13.8/13.9.  Rage will break a root only at the last second of the nano, if at all.  Rage use to break roots 3-10 secs into it's duration.  Now, the root/slow doesn't drop until rage drops too.  There are many roots that I am unable to break at all.  This is one of only 2 legitimate root-breaking nanos in the game and the other one has never worked correctly.  This is a huge blow to the Enforcer method of game play and just seems outright nerfish.  In the patch notes, it was discussed that there would be some changes regarding root.  I sincerely hope those changes didn't mean to break Rage while still allowing the debuff exploit  to continue.

Could we please get a response from Cosmik/CZ on this issue??

Why replace your Yalmaha!? A ql30 is just as fast as a ql62 - so basically it is just wasted IP...

Angeleye @ 3/1/2002 11:22:51 AM (13570):
Sorry to hear about your loss...

I have several screenshots of my chars in their Yalmahas, both from 1st person view and 3rd person view (with my self targeted and of course in the air) and with the command /played activated.

This must for sure be counted as evidence that I do own a Yalmaha, if they cannot "see it in the logs" that I have lost my jet...

Luckily I haven't lost my jet (yet)...

Nanogater @ 3/1/2002 11:35:11 AM (Min dmg bug and HE bug 13596):
Did a 20% mission last night, fighting mostly grey mobs. Mostly using a fast dmg NF and as usual I do get 75% hits for min dmg, 20% hits inside 10-60% of dmg range and 5% does from 30% to 5% below min dmg. BELOW MIN DMG!!! I am very fed up with this crap.

Our HE buff, it last for 1 hr but stop adding NP after 30 min  

Yes I am a NT, lvl108, and yes I am fed up with only being able to do missions in teams. I like teaming, np, but I would appriciate the possibilty of being able to survive 50% missions solo as well so I could play for tokens whenever my buddies is not online. As it is now, 20% missions are close calls and lasts for 2-3hrs, and most likely give no token because most mobs are grey. Mission blitzing with calm is no good token wize. Beside, calm is hellish since I am forced to autoattack and the delay client/server side so many times make me brake the calm and I end up reclaiming my stuff...

That is not true. Higher QL yalmaha adds more to run speed. Though if it's me, I'll just add directly to run speed instead.

Konril @ 3/1/2002 12:49:49 PM (Melee/martial arts bugged?  Or have I found a new "undoccumented feature?" 13603):
Today when logging in to do a mission as the opifex meta-physicist, I noticed something very strange.  While I was in combat with opponents, she punches between weapon swings.

Right now she specializes in the Protector Warblade, for several reason, one of which is because it fits my image of her.  Currently her Martial Arts skill is around 40, and 2 hand edged around 80.  According to the 13.9 patch notes, "You will no longer do damage with your fist while you wield a weapon and have a martial arts skill above 120. The exception is if you use weapons that require a martial arts skill to wield. You will then do both fist and weapon damage as intended."  However it seems something has gone terribly wrong.

I have noticed two attack bars charging and draining, like my character was dual-wielding something, I was doing 10-17 melee damage between energy hits from the protector warblade, and the animation of the combat in third person clearly showed her punching between swings.  The requirements of the Protector warblade include, 2h Edge, Psycho Mod, Brawling, Sneak Attack, Fast attack, and Dimach.  There is no mention of martial arts anywhere in the description of the warblade.

My question: Is requirements in brawling and/or dimach enough to define a weapon as a martial arts weapon, which means things are working as expected, or is this a bug?  

This metaphysicist is just level 22 now, which means I can still have her switch weapons.  My choice of the Protector Warblade was precicely because of the Psycho-mod requirement in the mix.  I can use Teachings of Psychological Modification, and better formulas as an attack rating buff, to otherwise do better with the warblade than I could hope for with other melee weapons.  However this won't work if I have to train martial-arts to keep up-to-date.  If I'm stuck punching, I would be much better off switching her to a pure martial-arts setup to save IP.  So what is the deal?

Angeleye @ 3/1/2002 12:55:15 PM (13578):
Even though stated in the desc a ql200 Yalmaha is not any faster than a ql30 (perhaps bugged?) when flying. Besides if you already have a low ql Yalmaha I don't see any reason why one wants to raise the VA skill to use a higher ql jet, no mob can touch you and you will get to any area without getting into any bigger problems...

MrBunny @ 3/1/2002 1:05:45 PM (13578):
There isnt a real difference between a ql 67 and a ql 30 besides that a ql 30 just has a lower req than the ql 67. The difference in run speed is just really not worth the ip invested in the 200+ vehicle air.

Don't count on it. If you can't prove that you didn't accidentally delete your Yalm then you are toast.

On the plus side, there have been numerous reports that Yalms and other vehicles are popping up much more frequently in missions after 13.8.

RoboKa @ 3/1/2002 4:50:10 PM (pets roots and obstenance 13656):
Several players have asked me to post this.  I am not sure if this is the best forum, but...

There are two complaints that seem to be becoming consistent amoung pet owners:
Chain rooting in missions is becoming a problem.
I can only speak from my experience and I think that "Chain rooting" may be an over statement.  I do find that my pet seems to get rooted in at least one out of four rooms in missions since the 13.6 patch.  However, I have leveled some in that same period and the problem may have been caused by the higher missions I m doing and not the patch.

But, this doesn't change the fact that pet-roots-post-combat really makes the game boring and hence, less fun.

Please don't misunderstand.  I DO NOT want roots taken our or nerfed.  They are an important part of the game.  Perhaps I should explain for those who don't play pet professions and don't know how we solo.

The pet is our strongest weapon.  Whether it is yellow or red, self-buffed or help-buffed, using the pet as a personal tank is the best way to solo.  Typically, I sneak-target the MOB in an upcoming room. Then I command the pet to wait at the door while I retreat from line-of-sight with the MOB.  At this point I send the attack command to the pet.  Nine times out of ten times, the MOB will agg onto the pet and I am left out of the battle completely.  Depending on the color of the MOB I either join in the attack (lower level MOBs) or stay out of line-of-sight (higher level MOBs,to be safe).  When the combat is over the pet returns to my safe-position and resumes guard mode.  Because of the strength of the bot, these battle typically last less than a minute.  So, the battle is over and there is very little chance of additional agg unless I have done something really stupid like stand next to a door to a room that is not yet cleared.  Obviously there are complications to this senario (rooms with 2 MOBs, MOBs calling for help, the MOB-is-90%-dead-and-desperately-trying-to-change-target thing, me being stupid, etc.), but in most cases this is a repeatable process for most rooms in a missions.  

The problem occurs when a the pet gets rooted during or (in particular) just at the end of battle.  The room the bot is in is now empty, so he's not gonna get agged.  I'm not gonna get agged, cause I'm in my safety-spot or in the room with the pet.  If the root were on me, I could break it with melee incompetence (which I keep on the action bar for just that purpose).  I cannot run melee incompentence on the the pet.  A master is not allowed to run hostile nanos on his pet.  SO there I am, completely safe and utterly bored, because I can't move to the next room and repeat the steps listed above without the pet.  And its just not safe to move forward on my own without my weapon (da pet).  As you know, roots can last anywhere from a few seconds to 20 minutes (seems like hours); this can get really boring and it is not good for games to be boring.

This whole situation is compounded when the pet is behaving as the tank for a team and the whole team has to wait for the pet-root to end...its just plain embarrassing.

So, back to the original statement, "Chain rooting in missions is becoming a problem."  I think the problem is caused more by the lack of a mechanism to break root on pets once they have completed battle...although roots do seem to have become more frequent.Bots are not responding to commands.

Many things have been reported to me in this area, however I will only present the data to which I can bear witness.

I have experienced only short term and minor problems in this area during soloing; nothing worth mentioning here.

Teams are a different story.  The problem I am about to describe seems to occur more frequently, more severly and for longer durations as the number of pets on a team increases, but one pet is enough to get it started. Actually, now that I think about it, maybe its caused by net team members (eg: 6 players + 2 pets = 8 net team members).  Since I don't usually work in small teams, I don't have enough data to be sure.  I did do a duet (2 players + 1 pet = 3 net team members) for a couple of missions the other night and the problem never occured.  I can state that for net team members of 7 on up the problem occurs and gets worse and worse (6 players + 3 pets = nine net team members = crippled pet functioning).

So here's the problem.  Normally in team missions, I keep the pet on guard.  That way, once a puller has initiated battle, all I have to do is run through the MOB and the pet aggs on it.  I never have to use attack and the pet just stays on guard constantly.  This works very well.

However, since 13.6 in teams with large net team member totals, this no longer works because after battle, the pet either does not go back into guard mode, or guard mode does not function the same way.  More specifically, once a battle is over, the pet just stands there where the battle finished.  He does not return to my side.  HE does not seem to guard.  He doesn't even seem to know I am there.  If I send commands, the first few are ignored.  If I get a guard command through he utters the guarding response chat, but still just stands there.  If I send follow commands, after 6 or 7 he will respond to 2 or 3.

I believe this to be a bug because; A) It is not consistent, B) FunCOm has never suggested any changes like this and C) The behavior resembles a memory leak or resource exhaustion since it will not occur as soon as the team begins the missions, but rather after several battles have taken place (it seems the larger the team, the quicker it begins).  A full team zone seems to help, but its hard to get that sort of cooperation (rezone every 6 battles? what r u, nutz?).

This may or may not be what folks mean when they complain to me that their Bots are not responding to commands, but I sure would like to see this fixed.

There!  I done posted it!

slashalot @ 3/1/2002 4:51:32 PM (13570):
Yup found a level 33 Yalm last night in a mission with my enforcer.  Only needed 94 skill to fly.  Whole new game for my level 32 enforcer.  Was in a unlocked box.

Ampris @ 3/1/2002 4:51:52 PM (13590):
Actually, the description of Rage nanos is more like the following

"Accelerates the body's metabolism to such a rate that the Enforcer actually ignites. This briefly increases movement speed and initiatives. The Enforcer continuously takes damage while this nano lasts, but so do all enemies that hit the Enforcer during this period. The nanobots also attempt to remove combat debuffs currently on the Enforcer and give a Nano AC boost while they are operational."

OtakuCODE @ 3/1/2002 5:38:52 PM (13341):
Level 17 Nanotechnician over here... wielding a hammer myself, and wondering why in the blue blazes I'm hitting for 6 damage... just glad I have a bunch of nanos to take up the slack but this is definitely a BUG!

OtakuCODE

OtakuCODE @ 3/1/2002 5:46:46 PM (Is this a bug? 13670):
I definitely consider this a bug but maybe I'm just ill-informed... very, very, VERY frequently I will accept a mission that has a reward of, say, an Enhacned Pair of Energized Pants... I will complete the mission and receive my reward - a Battered Pair of Energized Pants.  WTF?  Why do the mission terminals lie about the quality of the reward?

OtakuCODE

Bionitrous @ 3/1/2002 6:01:52 PM (13656):
Pretty miserable to wait ten minutes for snare to wear off you 'bot, huh?  It's come to the point where I sometimes just log out of the game if a fight ends and I see the green glow around all three of my pets for the 12th time in a mission.  At least as an MP, I can kill them and make new ones after about two recharge kits and three minutes of creating and buffing.  I shudder to think of the life of an Engineer in a mission.

I could deal with it once or twice a mission.  It's just that now it's every god damn battle.  And it's not just one pet, it's me and all three of them.  At least I can Mind Blast myself once the fight is done.

As for nerfing Root and Snare I disagree.  They are absolutely useless to the majority of NPC's in missions.  Me and my three pets stand there and whack the MOB.  Then we are all four instantly snared and we stand there and whack the MOB.  Then we all four are Rooted and we stand there and whack the MOB.  Then maybe the heal pet dies and I make a new one and we whack the MOB.  Then the MOB refreshes all the Roots and Snares just before it dies.  

The Roots and Snares of the typical MOB are not used right and should be removed in missions until they can add a simple AI behavior to only execute them if there is a chance that it makes sense.  

For example: 

- Do NOT cast root or snare if neither MOB or Target is moving and both are within attack range.
- DO cast Snare if MOB is not moving and Target is moving in a vector away from MOB.
- DO cast Root if Target has moved out of Melee range.
- IF all hostiles are Rooted OR Snared and self-hitpoints < 10% Then RLF.

I guess the problem is that the stupid ass MOB's are doing roots and snares when you (or more specifically your pets) are two feet away from them and kicking their ass.  There are better things to waste a MOB's nano or time on.  Also once they Root you they stand there to get beat on till they die.  I know I wouldn't.

In addition to the MOB's actual Rooting and Snaring behavior being brought under control, I think pet users need a way to break Roots and Snares on their pets.  I think a "Pet NCU Refresh Trimmer" (TM) that wipes a pets NCU would be nice for Engineers and 'Crats.  I play a 'Crat and wouldn't mind refreshing the buffs on my 'droid if it meant I didn't have to destroy it.

As I also have a Meta, I guess I can deal with destroying Rooted or Snared pets if they would fix the rooting and snaring behaviour as stated above.  I don't mind making new pets as a Meta.  After all I'm gonna have to do it in less than 15 minutes anyway and it's a good chance to refresh the pet timers.  It'sjust that I don't want to have to do it every damn room in a 150 room mission.

Kurupt @ 3/1/2002 7:13:51 PM (12298):
i have the same problem since that patch 13.8 ( after i downloaded it, my character looks all weird with a skirt, i zoned and reloged many times, i unequiped it, i changed pants but nothing happen and i was wearing a cloak but i put it in my inventory with my weapon, before the patch update but both disappeard from my inventory with my weapon, i find that sucks to have a character looking weird and all when you don't have the choice, it's funny in the begining but now i fed up having a char. which can't wear pants, so i hope y'all will do something to fix that

Ampris @ 3/1/2002 7:45:43 PM (13670):
Why do the mission terminals lie about the quality of the reward?

As you say, the items name isn't accurate.  Think that's a known issue and it has always been that way.

The quality of the item (QL) should be what was shown in the mission reward.  Just the name of the mission rewards uses the best possible name.  The mission doesn't use the name that is reflective of the QL of the item.

The properties of the item you get (except for some NCU belts) should be what was shown when you examined the mission reward.

So you are getting what was promised in the mission.

Ferdoc @ 3/1/2002 8:01:33 PM (Bug? 13696):
Not sure if this a bug or, if its just me, but, my biomech armour cloak (now worn on the back) always shows that it is not equpied after I zone. 

So I was just wondering if anyone else was having this problem?

Loxt @ 3/1/2002 8:03:07 PM (13570):
Found a Q55 yalm for my L55 enf in a Lush mission last night, and then found a Q30 yalm with my L25 MA in a mission in Trade about an hour later. They are popping up like bunnies, so do those Q30ish missions and check every chest. Mine were both in locked chests.

Angeleye @ 3/1/2002 10:19:15 PM (13570):
Yep they are for sure popping up more often now, found two Hydro Vehicles (both ql118) in the same mission this evening (read: friday)!!

Not that they are of any use to me, but always nice to find some special in the chests

another bug is when you go out of visual range of a MOB or player you are fighting then you cant hit them back anymore... very easy to reproduce, start a fight run away, run back and see what happpens (you also get a message "attacked by none")

Umm.. What good is runspeed when your flying? All yalms fly the same speed period.. What do you care if your runspeed is higher? You get out of the Yalm and OFF goes the run speed.. ql30 is the best yalm to have cause of reqs, flys just as fast as any other Yalm..

my god you enforcers are all whining more than the NTs.

Just suck it up and accept the fact that your "rage"
is nerfed.

Your rage nano was always broken from the first place. 
Funcom just fixed it so that you can't use rage to brake roots.
But they just didn't want to tell you as to upset their
player base. So they kinda coded it in, hoping you wouldn't
notice. 

Course that wasn't genius but it was a sly way of doing it.

theres a bug in the coding or some thing because as soon as the 13.8  patch came out the is no omni-pol white or omni-pol elite armors any were in the shops. i spent 3 rl days to find some asked people but there is none on the omni side i know that much.

it's NOT JUST a plane.
Having a plane is very much like having a car in RealLife.
Travelling to distant places is all of a suddon possible.
(well, try going deep into clon**** withouot getting aggroed by some deep red mob at lvl30)

More missions become available to you (since you don't need to sneak around all them red mobs in certain areas)

One's life soon become dependent on the yalm. I'd say, after my weapon, it's the second most important item I've got!

So, it's not "just" a plane

anyway, sad to see it happen. and remember "repair"missions are not the only type of missions they appeared

And packet loss isn't lag, though the effects can be simillar. Games such as Half-Life minimise the effects of packet loss byNOT resending data, but using client side prediction and maintaining the master state only on the server. The server is the 'real' world, the client is only ever an approximation. This helps with lag (delays in transmission) aswell, but leads to 'jumping' when the server manages to update the client, and prevents different clients from agreeing on the game state at any given time.

Your discussion is pretty accurate in all other respects.

From what I've read, AO uses TCP which isn't a very good idea for internet online gaming in real-time or near real-time, and I suspect a lot of the problems relate to that. i've no idea of the details of AO's network infrastructure so can't comment further. 
			
		
	

Darkbane - Thanks for clarifying on that.  I agree.  And you are most likely correct on what FC-AO is doing now that I think about the way things work while online.

In terms of the lag, I have to wonder though... AO's lag does not seem to be the same as one would see in Half-life.  According to the tests I have run with my tools while running AO, it does not seem to be an internet issue.  Sometimes the problem appears to be a routing issue on the FC side.  And other times I get a server 'busy' signal.   The one common factor each and every time however is that all of the tools agree the 'lag' is FC based whether routing, server or what is anyones guess.

Personally, I think it is server based.   When I play at 3am my time, there is absolutely no lag issues what so ever.  As 7am approaches, you start to see more and more people log in to the game.  And as each new person logs in, return data times get longer and longer and longer until suddenly I start seeing the server busy messages again.   Based on this, I would suggest that they have way to many people on a server OR the servers they are using are not powerful enough to process all of the data needed for that many packet requests.

The ping remains constant and does not change during this.  Only the actual packet information being returned changes.   That suggests that it is indeed server based, not internet or tcp based.

Grimmtooth @ 3/2/2002 7:29:37 PM (Wtf? 13810):
I started a mission in North Lush feilds. I got 90% of the mission area cleared out when I had a CTD. No problem, it happens. Except when I came back I was still in the room where I crashed but the surrounding rooms and room I had cleared out now had all the enemies back, my ass kicking soon ensued. Of course I had to run, but then I realized all the rooms had respawned and the chests. Needless to say I died as a 30 NPC mob chased me thru a mission area I was now lost in because my map had dissappeared. Only lost 35k xp not hard to get back. This should be no excuse for it happening. Some would say I could start over so I could clean out the chests again. After I left the reclaim machine(whom I'm now married to btw, thx) I went to the store to sell my gear. I had 11 maps of newland and mort a slew of pistols (NT here. Like I need more pistols) a painting and other basically useless items. So going back to clean out the chests reason is out the window (btw, most of the chests are empty anyway). Go back to get the lost xp? It took me almost 2 hours to get the area cleared out the first time. I have only the token to hope for but now that I have all the enemies back will I have to start all the way over?
  These little glitches in the system are very frustrating and if it weren't for multiple tokens I would just delete the mission and move on but, deleting and moving on should not be an excuse for this to keep happening. So many hours of work thrown to the wind. 
 For the love of something!! FIX IT!!!

Update:
  Went back to the mission (I'm a glutton for punishment) area, When I got inside all the enemies were traveling around as if there was no order at all.  In the third room I got hit with all the ransack nanos available in game,  I called it quits and deleted the mission. 

This glitch happens a few times a week. I'm begging you! Please fix:
Respawning of enemies in a mission area
resetting mission maps
lousy treasure chest loot

2. Items fall through the floor / enquip / reshuffle when zoned

- Suggestion: pull your heads out of your a*ses Funcom and re-write your sh*tty code

3. Engineer, Crat and MP pets pathfinding, sticking and control

-Suggestion: did you write the pathfinding code for these in Fortran ? FIX IT - it is the most frustrating thing for these professions

Ancaligon @ 3/2/2002 10:58:59 PM (Found Bug 13839):
I found the NF Phoenix Storm in a mission and when I uploaded it the crystal didn't disappear.  I've heard of this issue occuring in the past and just wanted to give a heads up. Not sure if this is important but it was the reward for the mission.

Pluteaux @ 3/3/2002 12:27:11 AM (Computer machine in Special Advanced and Superior supermarkets 13845):
In Special/Advanced and Special/Superior supermarkets, there are 4 machines, one labelled OT Computers or Clan Computers. These machines only have Basic items. It sure would be a lot easier for me to find the belts, NCUs, etc., that I am searching for if these machines stocked Advanced and Superior items.

Valis @ 3/3/2002 1:10:39 AM (Bugs bugs and more bugs 13852):
Actually some of these might have been posted here already, but I am not gonna cruise through all the posts, getting ready to call it a nite, but figure I need to point out a few things first.

I have noticed, esp. after death that healing and replenishing  nano then rezoning into a mission more times than not will cause you health and nano to drop down to a certain point, not sure what the significance of the number is, but I can tell you that it will occur when you try and use a treatment kit and it wont' heal you beyond a certain point, yet if you sit you will be able to heal full.  Trouble is that when you zone back to mission point or actually zone in general, it has happened to me zoning in and out of stores also, that your health and nano will drop to the point where your treatment kits will not heal past.  After the one drop, everything seems to go back to normal. 

Next, this might not actually be a bug but a feature but I think it should be a bug, it seems that Trader NPC's can cast both diminish skills and ransack skills.  This is a really nasty combo, I can imagine for casters this is insta death.  But seeing as they look to me to be the same basic spell line, why should they stack?  I play an agent and my agent damage program the anatomy stuff, does not stack with the general weapon damage boost, augment weapon.  I would think that these should stack since they are basically separate lines of programs.  I would also like to say that an emit should be sent to the program initiator when a program ends, IE: when a dot finishes it should send a msg back to the caster not just the target.  

Third this goes to mission dungeons.  I was in a mission (7429-323), got in over my head and boogied to the main entrance and zoned.  I then healed up and knowing that there would still be multi mobs at the main room, decided to try and drag them back to the room they came from.  I enter, go out the first door and hang a left along the wall till I get to the first door on the left wall, go through the door and wham I am back in the first main room that you enter and heading out the main door back to the real world.  Nice warp.  Oh and the mobs never left the room.  Also along simular lines I notice that if a mob starts casting and you duck out of los, the spell will still go off, yet I can not cast or fire back.  I also notice that there are times when I can be standing at the door and be able to shoot mobs, yet not be able to cast on them.

Lastly about casting, I notice that a good percentage of the time I will start a program, it will complete, yet I get no msg about the outcome.  I notice that the nano cost gets deducted, but the program doesn't seem to run.  I don't get a you fumble or your target counters. Just nothing.  Now it might be simular to the melee interruptus happening, except that it is me being shot and that is causing the program to fail, but still a message would be nice.

Thanks Malakie, very interesting.

Divillian @ 3/3/2002 6:19:29 AM (11049):
From the sound of it this sounds like a bug. Not lag. If it was lag it wouldnt be well after the battle. Notice how it happens usually when someone is healing after battle. And that people have lost ITEMS. Im throwing my money towards glitch, not lag.

Cashish @ 3/3/2002 12:14:59 PM (12298):
so i bought another trenchcoat, put it on, then forgot about it.  when i took it off i had my legs back!

Kurupt - you may wanna try this, it worked for me.  i would think you could use a cloak also, but i didn't try that.

thanks to Traydee for the in-game info

Karax @ 3/3/2002 12:21:10 PM (11049):
Man... Could Soozan be any more frustrating?  This post is truly as useless as any of his/hers as I just couldn't help but jump in only to say how god damn irritating that person is. 

        Not only did he/she  devalue a bug I'd like to see looked into by sticking his or her head up her ass and blaming it on 
connection speed, but she posted just to be antagonistic(sorta like this post, but I couldn't take it anymore..).

       FURTHERMORE she then makes some idiodic reply without even reading malakie's(sp) post as she probably got bored after the first sentance because there were no pictures. 

       I imagine a homeless man balls deep in a grapefruit producing more useful information than Soozan on her best day.

I'd like to continue, but picturing Soozan's balnk ignorant stare at the monitor is too discouraging....

Ransack and deprive stack thats not a bug, NPC traders previously did not tend to cast both.  They seem to do this alot more lately.  Very deadly to nano users like NTs.

I see the lack of notification of failure quite a bit.  Especially on ransack, nothing shows at all you see the counter and the graphic like you ran the nano, but no response saying it was countered you fumbled and it definitely did not work.

Mustafo

Mustafo @ 3/3/2002 3:06:59 PM (13839):
Fins items in missions have always done this.  There is some debate on using it more than once, but FC has not really responded on this.  I usually use the item then sell it to a shop.

Mustafo

Mustafo @ 3/3/2002 3:14:54 PM (13810):
Actually my friend is quitting AO because of this he lost 500k experience and the GM told him that this is a feature not a bug. Also he was told that what happened to him is normally the result of a server crash and that they had no log of a server crash.

I understand the technical issue here, if the gameplay field crashes it may be difficult to save the settings.(assuming that crashes are unexpected and less than graceful)

To me this is really poor customer service, but there should be an equitable solution.  Really when you login you should not be placed back in the middle of a huge mission with no map.  This can be really deadly if your a pet class since your pets will be gone as well.  At a minimum the player should be placed back at the start of the mission if something like this occurs.

Mustafo

Mustafo @ 3/3/2002 3:27:08 PM (943):
This happened in 2 missions where it seemd to start out fine and eventually ended up like this.

See mob, press q.
All damage I would do to the mob until it was dead would instantly show on the chat.
mob would then shoot back even though my client sees the mob as dead(ie. I can't fight back now)
Mob would continue to shoot for the number of rounds it took for the damage to occur even though that damage was already shown to the client.


So here I am wandering about a mission with stuff thats dead following me and shooting me.  Was really funny as they appeared as if they had some sort of slow running.  

Zoning seemed to fix the problem, but it happened again in the next mission.



In addition I am seeing mobs that fight back once dead when I play as an NT.  The mechanics are different enough that it can't show all the damage I guess.  In one case I was doing the backflip for the next level and the darn thing nuked me and killed me, then fell to the ground dead.  Here I am in the throes of death right after I kill the darn thing that just killed me.  Both of the bodies laying on the ground.  Oh well at least I didn't lose any EXP on that one!

Mustafo @ 3/3/2002 3:29:56 PM (fighting after dead 13904):
Seeing mobs that fight back once dead.  The problem is worse when I play a ranged weapon user.

Nano user such as NT see it less but still see it.

hobbes @ 3/3/2002 3:34:17 PM (12718):
You fools, don't you see, even now, I am doing this! 

In my pioneer backpack I found this special nano, "Essensce of Jumbled Inventory". I have cast it on everyone. It is so powerful that you can't even see it on your NCU! Ha!

Do not dispair, I can fix this for you for a small price. If you see me ingame, give me 1 million credits and I will remove this hex.

Hope to see you soon.

PS: I am also the one who erases your mission maps when you zone.

hobbes @ 3/3/2002 3:41:48 PM (13904):
In the patch code, Funcom moved the headstones, but they didn't move the bodies. So the MOBs are coming back as ghosts.














Yes, I am bored. Yes, that is obscure reference to a movie from the 80s. My signature is from a different movie, of course.

Black Omni-Pol Elite was removed from shops when int/psych armor was taken out of shops. Now it's mission only. 

But as far as I know, the white Omni-Pol is still around?

FireC @ 3/3/2002 11:08:53 PM (13810):
This has happened to me a few times after the last pathc(es) as well. It's very not good when you've cleared out most of the mission, are somewhere *very* far from the door, have made huge amout of xp and just found the mission item but had no time to pick it up. I thought about petitioning to get out of the place alive but as I was not sure if I'd get a warning for using petition stuck in that situation and had no time to wait hours to get my petition answered I decided not to do it (yes I think ARK could have teleported me out as there is no way a mid level soldier could get that far into a mission without killing everything on the way or dying and it really can't be my fault the place crashed and respawned).

Things are going back to what they were in the beginning. Crashing when zoning. Getting stuck in some area for a good while (one of my characters has been stuck in Wailing Wastes for some time now - the area seems to be down). Huge lag in Tir and Newland, lately I've been barely able to move there. Crashing in missions and everything respawning.

Everything was so much better for a while, and now I once again wonder why the hell did I bother to come back at all.

Kyvin @ 3/3/2002 11:31:20 PM (What's going on (again) 13947):
I've been able to log onto RK1, but jsut barely. it takes about 5 minutes at the loading screen, and when I do get in, I cant stand, talk, cast nanos, or do anything except run (If I'm standing).

I'm in newlands and I heard something about newlands being broken or something... I have no idea, I just want to know if anyone else is having this problem or weather my ancient computer has finally caved in.

FireC @ 3/3/2002 11:54:59 PM (13947):
Newland and Wailing Wastes (at least those two) are having trouble. One of my characters has been stuck there for over an hour now.

Khayne @ 3/4/2002 12:59:06 AM (13810):
This absolutely has to be fixed ASAP. I have even mailed support about this, and i got the usual "we are working on it". Well, i sincerely hope they do, and meanwhile we should have a fix that puts us in the start room automatically if the mission server crashes. That shouldnt be too hard now, should it. If thats too hard then at least put us outside.

Khayne @ 3/4/2002 1:03:27 AM (12718):
Damn you Hobbes... I knew you had something to do with this.

Cloudeh @ 3/4/2002 1:35:05 AM (13771):
As far as I can remember, I have never ever seen Elites in sops.

Yesterday I saw my first Biomech cloak in the store, hmm they have never EVER been there.

Valis @ 3/4/2002 4:36:14 AM (13810):
It's happened to me a couple of times now.  First time I tried to send a bug report, but guess what that don't seem to work now either. Go figure.   I just been lucky enough to fight my way out.  Almost didn't make it once though, ran out of heals and almost out of ammo.  But then I try to think of it as double bonus time, double loot, double cash, double xp... .  Personally I think they really screwed the pooch this time with the last patch, but hey I hear FC doesn't undo their mistakes they just patch over it and hope the process stack can handle the load.

Valis @ 3/4/2002 4:43:22 AM (Woot now we can't zone? 13966):
Ok, this kinda sux.  First time it just happened, I put it down as a oh well life goes on kinda thing, but now I am a bit irrated.  First off it starts with me getting in over my head and trying to zone out.  Hmm, 5 min go by and I am staring at a black screen with the words changing zones in the chat.  Fine, since I can't get AO to respond to anything, no mouse no nothing, I end task the sob.  Log back in, get the msg I have an active char and do I want to log it in, Ok, kewl.  Woops, I am still in mission zone and I am gonna die, quick get to the door out, woops nothing, no zone msg, no nothing, like you are hitting the wall, just keep moving to the side.  I die, sux2bme.  Oh well, fine respawn in Trade, go to the whompa's to get back to Ent. and hmm, been 20 mins. been reading the boards and toggle back from time to time and I still ain't in Ent.  Something seems to be broke guys, could be the problem that was happening in Newland earlier? except now it has spread?  I don't know but I am going to now go end task AO again and relog and see what is what.

Ok i have noticed alot of cars/planes popping up in missions latley (got a boat and mid today).
So my wife was out doing a mission in Tir and shouts to me " Just found a Yalm"   woot...

So i run over there to pick it up (i dont own one) got to the mission and dupe they key and follow her to the box...

Gone!!!    

No box no Yalm...like wtf..  

Is this a new feature that we cant share cars/planes with our friends/family/guild mates.

Now both of us have lost out ..

Do boxes decay if you leave mission???

Anyone had this happen to them?

Khissi/Isin @ 3/4/2002 7:44:50 AM (Lost items due to server reset.. 13975):
This is technically a bug, I suppose, but Advisor Epim told me to write this here, as well as sending an email to the bug team, in hopes that my items can be retrieved.  

She asked that I provide all the information I could in hope that you can restore my armor that was lost when the Baboon's server reset tonight.  All the patrons were reset, so I know that it was your server, and not my isp.  I petitioned at 3:45:21, but not sure of the exact time of the reset, only that it was not very long before that time.  It took me a few minutes to realize that my armor was not on me.
 

My guild parties in Baboon's on Sunday nights, and I have lots
of outfits that I like to change into, several of those being
social armor which requires that I remove all my other armor.  I
had put my armor, all of it including shouder pads and rings and
braclets, into a pack.. my helmet was in another pack.. the one
where I keep my sunglasses.. cause I take it off when I'm just
running from place to place and switch it with my glasses.  The
party had broken up and I was talking with some friends.  I
changed out of my social armor and tucked it into my party
clothes pack, and put all my real armor on, including switching
into my helmet.  I had planned to do a mission before going to
bed.  Instead.. the baboons server reset.

When I got back online, I didn't notice anything was wrong at
first.  Then I switched views to  3rd person, and realized that
I was back in my social armor and sunglasses.  So, I opened my
pack to put my armor back on, thinking that it had set us back
to a previous server save.  My armor was not there.  Another
pair of sunglasses was in my helmet pack, and another social
armor was in my party clothes pack, exactly as I had put them
when I dressed before the reset, and I was wearing a pair of
sunglasses and the exact same social armor.

So, I zoned.. nothing.. I rebooted... nothing.  I need my armor.
 I am nothing without my armor.  I can't hunt. I can't do
anything to even replace what I had.  Please, can you find a way
to help me.  Can you reset me to a previous time or something? 
I can't function with no armor and this was not my fault.  Your
saves must be separate.. packs from body, and the body had not
saved after I changed, but the packs had.  I love this character
because I can solo and play even though I have to be afk alot. 
Please, please find a way to prove that this really did happen
to me and find a way to replace what I lost.  I want to play.


Thank you,
Khissi, 60 Solitus Doctor on Rubi-Ka 1

M@hdi @ 3/4/2002 8:23:00 AM (943):
Don't know if this has been mentioned, but it's a small but annoying bug.

I went into a mission, cleared it out and picked up the item (find item mission) since I had a number of maps (NL and Mort), a wealth of info tools and some trimmers in my inventory, the item I picked up filled the last slot. No worries, the token and the mission reward just go to the "Overflow" screen waiting to be picked up. I click the token which is put into my inventory, right click it (w00t!) and then I click the mission reward (deck range increaser). It disappers from the overflow window and into my......hey wait........it's not in my inventory?! Multiple zoning didn't fix this, the item is lost forever  Tested again with a backpack full of plasma I used to fill up my inventory before the end of the next mission, same result.

No harm done in this case, but I can immagine someone doing a mission for a Q200 coat or weapon, wuold be quite upset if it happened to him/her.

Ashuras @ 3/4/2002 9:02:31 AM (Mission Map Bug - With Eng Beacon 13982):
I was in a team, doing one mission solo.

Later, halfway thru the mission, I was beaconed into another mission zone to help my team.

When I'm in that new mission, I cannot see the map of the new mission, (I could see the doors) .....

What I could see if the map of my earlier mission on another part of the mini map.

It's a bit hard to describe, but if any of u DEV or watever wants a better "description" of the problem, I do have a screenshot that would speak a thousand words.

Just send me a PM or watever and I can send u the SS.

Ashuras @ 3/4/2002 9:05:04 AM (Yalmaha + Morph BUG 13983):
1) I zone into mission in Yalmaha.
2) End up in normal form
3) Cast tiger morph (or wolf or leet)
4) Finish mission, exit mission
5) Deactivate morph
6) Still remain in human form with plane RED out. 
    (Shouldn't I turn into plane form?)
7) Had to un-equip and re-equip plane to get back into plane mode.
8) But plane still with RED shade.

Fortunately this is only a visual bug right now... ie. the red out plane is still usable.

It's gone after a few zoning. 

Just to let u DEVs know about this.

Angeleye @ 3/4/2002 10:27:06 AM (13983):
Just deactivate the morph before exiting the mission and you will be in your jet...

Mine name is Osiis a Lvl112 trader on RK1.


Two days ago I lost 8 bags from my inventory.

I died while in a team.  When I was at reclaim grabbing my items I crashed.  When I logged back in everything I had grabbed from reclaim was now missing.  

Which was 8 bags and my 2 sets of ammo.

Inside those bags where my set of QL200 NCU, QL200 Flowers Set, Vektor Dragon, Krutt Queen Special, etc.

So am I pissed? Very much so.

To make it even worse the GM Lucien, who answered my petition and was 0 help.

Since this time I have talked to 2 ARKS Middlewold and Lacrymal.  Lacrymal was at least helpful.

I have heard lately MANY people are having this type of problem with items disappearing more than normal.  

Also I petition daily and FC no longer answers my in game petitions.  I emailed them and have yet to receive a response to my problem.

Well another user who has canceled their subscription to a game I actually enjoyed.  But if this is the type of support I am paying for then I would rather not pay.

Also to ARK Hwap who I ran into along with GM Ashmal.  Another user was at reclaim having bag problems.  GM Ashmal took a completely different approach to this users prblems than Lucien had with me.  I asked him why do GMs have different responses to similiar problems.  ARK Hwap replied because that user was being nice.  

As far as I know me and the other user pay the same monthly fee.  So I should be entitled to the same support as every other person regardless of my attitude.  No where in the EULA does it state customers will be treated accordingly due to their behavior.

Anyways

Docgalaad @ 3/4/2002 1:42:42 PM (13973):
Boxes have always decay after some minutes if you have open them to see what is hidden inside. If you dont pick up the items in the chest, the chest will disappear after a short time. You MUST pick up all you find. But if you want to give the NO DROP Item to a friend, you're screwed if your friend is not in the mission area with you. 

First, he must hurry up to join you near the chest.
Second, you have to exit the mission area to give him a key. If you exit, the open chest will disappear. 

This have always been like that. Except the time of disappearing has been reduce to some minutes instead of 10-15 minutes (patch 13.4). 

It's not a bug, and it's totally intended.

ntrox1 @ 3/4/2002 2:05:42 PM (Mobs healed, Modinos problem etc 14015):
I've checked the other threads and can't find these issues listed.  If I have duped, lemme know and I will delete this one..

1. My Atrox MP sometimes HEALS a mob with a NF, namely Mind Pain and Frost Slivers.

2. My Medinos often refuses to heal either myself or a team-mate.

3. When zoning into a mission area with a Medinos, it will disappear.  I need to recast again at this point.

I have lost my companion 3 times in one mission to a yellow mob due to 1 and 2.

hobbes @ 3/4/2002 2:46:44 PM (12718):
Oh yeah, baby, it's all me, Want to know the kicker though, your gonna love this.

This nano I cast is so powerful that it disrupts the normal flow of notum and this leads to, you guessed it....

LAG!!!

So I rearrange backpacks, erase maps and am responsible for all lag. A GM told that this was not an exploit and to keep up the good work.

I'm kind of ticked about the token change, I'm thinking of doubling lag.

I have tried to get into the apartments at several Newland backyards and have not been able to get in any.
Any ideas?
Also is there anyway that you can change your game name?

Kush @ 3/4/2002 4:11:26 PM (The "After dying in PvP bug"!! 14035):
Well, im not realy sure if this is a bug but it realy has to be!. Well it´s like this.

Twice in PvP recently when i have died, i have respawned at reclaim and about 3 seconds from that i DIE AGAIN??? how the hell is this possible?`. And nooo i am not doing **** , like attacking again. 

When i look at what killed me it´s poison dmg, it seems like it hits me even after i died the first time. It realy pisses me off.

Mahdi, you didn;t tell us whether you had cleared space in your inventory or how much space.  The overflow window is much like a backpack, if I see it correctly.  As with a backpack, you can't use or install directly from it - with any security.  If you right clicked on the token and it went to your board that was pure luck.

I alwas, as in ALWAYS, check my inventory before taking the mission goal.  I managed to frget once and when the overflow window came up I first opened a pack and moved some of the mission "junk" into it and then closed the pack.  Then I left-clicked the items in overflow and moved them, one by one, to my inventory without a problem.

Taking a bit more time and moving more slowly has saved me many a time.  <smile>  Like the "bug" with pets not following, I seldom have that problem with my Engineer as I move almost always in "attack" mode (H key) so I move slowly and the pet robot has less of a chance to get confused.  I watch folks run through rooms, jumping over tables and chairs and then get all upset because the robot is lost.

Eorl @ 3/4/2002 5:02:57 PM (13973):
The best way to do it is to keep the chest open while your buddy runs to your mission location.  You can dupe the key with the chest still open.   Note the location of the chest and when your buddy is right outside of the mission door quickly run out, hand him the key and then race back to the chest.  I usually take a screenshot of the map so that I can work my way back efficiently.  Playing in windowed mode is required though.

deanco2 @ 3/4/2002 6:17:04 PM (night vision goggles don't work 14061):
My night vision goggles don't work.. at all.  No difference in visuals whatsoever.   The stats aren't the problem, I got the stats to equip it and then some.  I gave them to another player in game, he said they worked fine for him.  I had another character in Omni, and they work fine for him.  What gives?  Thanks in advance.

Its a well known bug with NF's that come from "find item" missions. I delete them after use.

MA-Persil @ 3/4/2002 6:31:14 PM (13973):
Ok tnx for the replies..

I was 2-3 mins away from the mission when she found it and she waited outside till i arrived so it looks like it decayed..

We have never found one before so never knew what to do.:/

Anyway cheers for advice

1.) Mobs dont die when their bar is empty, but cant be targeted by nano or attack (most of the time they die from my damage sheild if this happens now)

2.) Windows Key and Alt-tab need to be disabled, or fix the graphics errors that happen when droped to windows and game restarted.  Ctrl - Alt - Del need to be kept active so we can End Task the game when it locks (i hate random program locks)

machievelli @ 3/4/2002 7:41:22 PM (Humidity Extractors - Time Broken 14076):
This is an easy one to fix (or should be I think).

Humidity extractors are suppose to run for 1hr (efficient up).

The icon for humidity extractors appears for 1hr in your buff bar.

The program itself is only running for half that time.

Please fix this.

Thank you.

I posted on this HE bug also.

It is a real pain in the butt - especially since the icon is up for 1hr . . . and you cant track when the effects are gonna run.

I hate having to watch the damn thing over and over to see if its been 30 minutes.

This seems easy to fix - just not sure why they havent.

I think Elite was in shops way back when. Like June/July. Just in superior shops, though. And I *know* int/psych armors were easy to buy, including ALL cyber and nano armor. People still gripe about that to this day.

Biomech Cloaks were in the shops before (appeared when Biomech was introduced), but they looked like Biomech chest armor and went into the chest slot as well. Now they have the correct icon and fit into the back slot.

At any rate, they give around the same amount of protection as a nano cloak.

Valis @ 3/4/2002 8:39:41 PM (13852):
Well if it isn't a bug, then I go back to my other question as to why my anatomy programs won't stack with the basic weapon augments.  These are different lines of spells.  One deals with increased damage due to additional knowledge, knowing where to hit, as opposed to the other which enhances a weapons performance, hence they should be stackable especially if the ransack and diminish stack.  I mean ransack and diminish are the same spell they both lower the skills of the target and increase the skill of the caster.   I am not trying to get traders nerfed here, I am just trying to point out that if these programs stack which are so simular, why don't others?

Nauls @ 3/4/2002 9:02:17 PM (Internet keeps disconnecting since last patch, any thoughts please? Also ping rate? W 14096):
Internet keeps disconnecting since last patch, any thoughts please? Also ping rate? What is ping rate? and can it be adjusted?

Since the last patch I keep getting disconnected. I have my email open and checking for mail first at 30 min, then 10, then 5 and finally every minute. No effect. 

This seems much more frequent on Rubi-ka 1 than 2 and is not predictable, it has happened changing zones, moving around, standing still. There is no damage it is just annoying as you know what. 

I would appreciate any feedback. I was wondering if ping rate can be adjusted and if this might help. 

Thank you in advance for your time and expertise!

Syd Janus @ 3/4/2002 9:48:29 PM (Stuck in the hinterlands.... 14107):
I'm not sure if anybody else has reported anything like this yet, 'probly so, but here goes


Last night i got a group together to go a mission, i havn't been on a group mission before.  the mission site was a long ways out of omni-1, and by the time we got there, it was pretty late, so after the mission, it was just me and one team member online, however, heading back home, we found there were no loads for zoning, and when we reached omni 1,  we couldn't enter the city at all!!!  While i had a lot of fun sitting in the access tunnel to omni1 roleplaying, i eventually had to terminate myself to get home, and lost more exp than i got on the trip...  hope this helps :]

p.s.  when trying to enter the city, it was just like accidentaly entering a building that's not open, i also once passed through some energy bars in a mission and got stuck on the wrong side, had terminate.   

Love to you, FC, thanks for listening!!!!!

rakhabit @ 3/4/2002 11:03:16 PM (13975):
It seems that your character is not saved, until you either zone, or properly log out. If the server crashes, it reverts to the last saved version of your character, anything that you have gotten in the meantime will be lost, since your character has not been saved. Anytime you trade something, ZONE. Anytime you change your clothes, ZONE. Yes that is a very annoying solution, and it really should not be necessary, but until Funcom fixes this, there is nothing more we can do.

Also Khissi, I know for a fact that GM's have tools to see what items you have previously had. A friend of mine lost her armor in a situation identical to yours, heh we were even in Baboons. When a GM finally came, he was showing her references for items that she had in the past, until he showed her the item that she lost. Once he showed her the right item, he gave it to her. So don't let them tell you that they can't replace the item, because they can.

Amen, this is the rage that can only come in AO. You get out in the middle of nowhere, get a bunch of XP, and then POW! You die!!!!! For no apparent reason!! WEEEE!!!! Oh yeah, you stay away from the sharp objects for a little while.

Demonlegion @ 3/5/2002 12:59:41 AM (height bug 14133):
i created my character as the tallest....after last patch i noticed i was now the shortest. did a petition and they brought me back to the create character screen.....fixed it. i was big again 
....until i zoned.     i went right back to being short as hell.

its not good when every woman you walk buy is far taller then you.

Dareus @ 3/5/2002 1:58:32 AM (Missions crashing and repopulating 14144):
Leaves me in the middle of the mission with no pets and a fully repopulated dungeon.

No Map, No idea which way is out and striped of the ability to defend yourself.


Heres what happens, about an hour or so into a mission.  Very large brown cave type I get booted with an error that says

"Problem with server"

I terminate the client, and when I log back into my account it doesn't say I'm already logged in when I should be.

At this point if you log in that character, you'll find them almost exactly where you left them in the now completly repopulated dungeon without any pets I might add if your the type who uses em.

Valis @ 3/5/2002 3:07:25 AM (Game just too unstable 14150):
Ok, I have had it.  Haven't been here long and looks like my belief that AO had become stable was incorrect.  This has all occured just tonight.  Problem is since the last patch this is an every night experience.  I have been dropped twice, don't think the server crashed.  Although it might have one time because I got the message server not responding wait a bit.  Died because I could not zone out of a mission area to save my butt.  Watched a dead mob kill me and lottsa other fun stuff.  Sorry guys but you got 2 weeks, my subscription runs out then, to fix the damn game and correct the most damaging bugs.   Personally I am beginning to think you guys like to take 1 step forward and 2 back.  This last patch is for crap, it blows and has caused nothing but headaches while fixing what? some minor incoviences?  
When I signed up, the game was playable (patch13.7).  I didn't have zombie mobs doing damage after they died, I didn't get killed while I couldn't see what the heck was going on.  I just died to a mob and I don't even know how it killed me, in the middle of the damn fight it stopped emitting the damage I was taking.  My counter would go down, but I don't know if I got nuked, shot or dotted.  Game must not know either cause all it said was you are dead.  I didn't get dropped 3 or 4 times a night, and don't tell me it must be my ISP, because your stupid ping counter was green and between 50-200 was the ping count.  I will be damned if I am going to pay you guys 12bucks a month to only be able to play 2 days a week for a couple of hours.  Basically you can play the game if you get on at a slow period, in other words you can't play when it is early nite in the States.  If you get on late enough the game smooths out a bit, but I am not gonna stay up to 1am my time to play your silly game.   I have 3 other buddies who were thinking about playing and just waiting on me to let them know what I thought about the game.  Well guess what, I am gonna tell them to not waste thier time because you guys still haven't got it right.

Valis @ 3/5/2002 3:31:00 AM (14096):
Ping is a tool for IP networks, what it does is send a packet out and times how long it takes to reach the destination and receive a response.  There is actually more to this than that, but in a nutshell that is what it does.  You can't adjust ping rate, it is a measurement of how long the information takes to travel from your PC to your destination server.  Not sure what the breakdown is of the color scheme of the ping icon, but I know green is like under 300ms, yellow under 1 sec? Red is anything over 1 sec. or 1000ms.   If you ping icon is green means that your network connection to the Dimesion server is pretty good, yellow means you are probably gonna have some lag issues and red means you are definately lagging.  But I don't think what you are experiencing is a network issue, if you read the boards there are tons of posts of people who are having the same issues you are as well as I and my ping times are good, green mostly except for a few times when it seems that the servers are bogged down. 
One thing you can do is shut off your e-mail when playing. Everytime you down load e-mail your ping time will go up because the e-mail download will "fill the pipe".  If you get e-mail with files or pictures and such in them, they will kill your ping times till they finish downloading to your mail client.

hobbes @ 3/5/2002 3:38:26 AM (14030):
I play this game from within my padded cell. No sharp objects allowed. Good one, Ming!

Valis @ 3/5/2002 3:42:03 AM (14096):
Oh, and about the Internet disconnect, are you actually getting disconnected from the Internet? or just the AO Servers?  If you are on a dial-up, using a modem, does your modem have to redial in order to reconnect to the AO servers? or do you just have to re-login?  If your modem is disconnecting from the Internet, you may have a problem with your phone lines and may be unrelated to AO.  If your modem is not re-dialing than it is just a problem with the AO servers.  

I also notice that if you set your dial up networking to disconnect on idle, that AO for some reason isn't considered active and windows will disconnect your Internet connection based on the idle time out that is set.  You can check this by going into dial up networking, click on properties for your dial up connection and checking the last tab labled dialing, toward the bottom you will see a check box with the lable Enable idle disconnect.  Uncheck this box.  I don't know if this is just in this patch or been around forever, I just know that it happens because I have been playing around with my Internet settings a bit and noticed that when I turned on the enable idle disconnect, my modem (ISDN terminal adapter) kept disconnecting.  I didn't turn it on before this last patch so I can't say that it didn't happen before now.

Valis @ 3/5/2002 3:44:44 AM (14144):
Server crashed, and based on the last information it got on your char.  It put you back in the mission, only it reset the mission.

Valis @ 3/5/2002 4:10:59 AM (11049):
Ok, fyi, I don't think the issue is network lag in general, otherwise why do my ping times stay constant? I am not on a "modem" but run a 128K ISDN terminal adapter and am getting a full 128K throughput, I personally believe, and this is from my experience playing text muds and such, and yes I have been around a long time, that there is a thing called the command queue or process queue, it basically sorts in order the commands that need special attention, this is not the whole deal, but for this post enough.  Now what you guys are calling sync issues, I believe are actually queue issues, commands are going in faster to the queue than the queue can process them. As an example you kill a mob, the command to kill the mob object or change the flag (if they are using some type of mud code base or they might be doing a kill object recreate new object, doesn't really matter the same basic process occurs) goes to the queue but the queue is backed up so the command doesn't process right away, you get the message mob dead because the program says when this happens send this command to change mob state from live to dead and send message to client.  Problem is that with the queue backed up, the object, in this case the mob does not get reacted upon, its state of being dead or alive does not change because the command to effect this change is stuck in the process queue and since the object is still a "live" object it continues to fight.  The message mob dead goes out because that doesn't go through the process queue, it is just a text echo to the client terminal. 
I may be wrong on this, I didn't write the code nor have I seen it, but I am basing it as I have said from my mud experience and the assumption that like Everquest, this game is basically built around mud and database technology.  But others I have talked to seem to think it is the same thing.  It really isn't a sync thing other than the server is unable to process change of state commands fast enough.  The information is getting to the server, usually, but the server can't react to the information fast enough.

BlackoutGrey @ 3/5/2002 4:16:29 AM (Game stoppers 14154):
A view of the problems from a 2hb enforcer:

I feel the game is almost unplayable solo at the time and very difficult for maintaining groupings.. What happens when doing missions are the following.

Can't hit - you get into a fight and can not hit. I am now not even registering one hit against green/yellow mobs.  Moving back and forth is not useful as a workaround for several reasons. You are now frozen repeatedly in place by mob's. Timing of when to move forward or back is no longer present due to the motioning of punching. I have invested heavily in melee initiative. The current game has effectively disabled this skill, I swing but do not hit. I punch when I should be swinging and connecting for damage. This for me is the largest bug that is now within the game. 

Zoning/healing mobs - this used to be a way to fight the occasional harder mob in a mission. This is no longer a viable way for fighting. The time taken now to zone in and out means at a minimum the mob will be half healed. Of course you are not healing during the zoning whereas the mob is healing itsefl the entire time. The result is a mob that is at full health every time you finish your healing and finally zone back in to the mission. Nano's cast on the ouside of a mission are still under the timer as well during the long zonings. This means shorter duration nano's like mongo are already half gone by the time you have rezoned.

Respawned missions - this would seem to indicate that problems are not with anyones connectivity, rather the server load is the problem. Spending an hour to clear a mission and approaching the mission reward only to have the mission respawned, one then dies on the way out of a once cleared mission losing all experience. This is a very large bug as well and is a "game-stopper" as it makes one playing not enjoy the experience. 

Random crashing to desktop - What exactly are the bug reports telling you when these are sent in? I would like to know if this is an identified problem with the patch or is the result of internet connectivity? Again I believe this is largely the game itself. It is happening to many people. If the pipes can not handle the increased network load then it is time to expand or switch your providers.

Server/client timing - When a mob dies sometimes I am still hit for damage, nano's are still cast against myself. Yesterday, I saw the dead NPC cast a health freeloader and actually was brought back to 1/4 health. What is strange also is a Da Taunter can be used for damage. But a weapon will state that the mob is already dead.
I run from a close battle to the mission exit. There I stand ready to continue the fight. The problem is the mob's do not appear. I am being nuked through walls and shot without being able to attack back. The mob is completely invisible and does not even register on the map as a dot. Zoning out is the only way to see the mob again. 

I am truly embarassed that all these new players who have come back to a game that is in such an unplayable and at a minimum-an unenjoyable state. "AO has changed" "Not the same game as launch" or so we told them. Personally, I believe it's obvious that at the present time it has not improved in terms of playability. 

Can someone please show me where an official statement regarding these problems and when the problems will be patched? I would be very appreciative as I do not frequent these forums. TIA.

Ive had this on a number of missions of different types, its usually fatal for me, being a pet class, and extremely annoying.

If i zone out of the mission and back in the mission state is saved.

I would like to see the mission state saved so that crashes like this do not result in a repopulated mission.

BOG is a stand up guy (when he is supine from dying , hehe JK)

He has been a fixture on the AOVault boards since last fall, he, like I, has stuck through with you guys through thick and thin.

cant hit - this I dont see for the most part, must be a melee issue, but i still do get some "blackhole" casts.

zoning/healing mobs - I have always hated this... I understand they should heal at somewhat of a better rate as to keep people from using a zone trick to kill reds, but come on, this is ridiculous.  The only way I get around it is by sticking a dot on them, this makes them think they are still in a fight, and so dont heal at that incredibly fast rate.  I shouldnt have to "cheat" to survive, you are supposed to figure out a middle ground so that people who did really cheat cant get what they want but still allow meritous players survive.

Respawned missions -  I do small missions, so this is less a problem for me but.. you should not allow respawning in a solo mission.

"Random crashing to desktop -   If the pipes can not handle the increased network load then it is time to expand or switch your providers."  

This one is just a big DUH.  Are you gonna let the people from DAOC quit all over again, cuz you cant stop penny pinching and buy more bandwidth?  you have a large influx of new players right now.  We, and they deserve to be able to play with the same stability that made us tell them to come back!

Server/client timing -  This seems patch related - Go fix it.

The rest of his observations are spot on.  And you should heed this guy, as he is a visible part of the community.  When you get someone who has been steadfastly supportive suddenly posting to your forum, you should WAKE UP, and take notice.

My healing pet has always been fickle when zoning.  Maybe it is because they hang back a bit from the fray, I don't know.

I have noticed she obeys me more when I tell her to guard me before I zone.  It's a pain, but it puts me in my happy place knowing she will be there when I'm facing a room of yellow bad guys.

M@hdi @ 3/5/2002 8:12:34 AM (943):
For the record: I left clicked the mission reward from the overflow window, and at that time, there was enough room in my inventory. I had also left clicked the token and that went into my inventory. Then I right clicked it and it was counted. I didn't try to install from the overflow window itself. You are right when you say things like this should be avoided though.

Another bug came to me last night. I had equipped a biomech cloak (which indeed fits the backslot now) but every time I zone, it disappears. I have to reequip it to make it visible again. The stats are unchanged (cloak still works) it's just not visible anymore. Kind of crappy since I use different types of armor. Makes me look like a badly made rug.

BlackoutGrey @ 3/5/2002 9:08:35 AM (14154):
I would be glad to show you the melee problem in game Noe, just send me a /tell. It was an admitted problem at roughly a month ago but it is now worse than ever. I believe it affects all hammer enforcers. I admitedly do not know about beams as one enforcer still says he "rocks" at level 70. A second friend, who is a level 78 enforcer using a QL151 hammer is having the exact same problems as myself.  I am using a QL200 sledgehammer. I am buffing with Brutal Thug and 2hb expertise.  If anyone has a workaround let me know I have tried just about everything. Nothing seems to work at this point including shuffling in place. Running away and stopping seems to be the only "workaround". This is just not a good workaround for obvious reasons. One fight the hammer will work, the next one it will fail. Roughly nine out of ten fights will have this bug.

The missions respawning are when the mission or zone server crashes and then drops the player from the game. You log into a blackness with the same mobs in every room that was cleared. If there is a mob in the room you are in and you are already injured there is no where to run. The player dies and loses all experience. This is not due to any timer which may cause respawning.

Beastkeeper @ 3/5/2002 10:45:07 AM (Who dies first ?? 14183):
Since the last patch I´ve had some problems with mobs.

I shoot them once but when I see at the text-box I´ve hit them 5-6 times within 1 sec  great if it wasn´t for the fact that the mob still keep hiting me even after it´s dead.

It counts as dead so I can´t cast Nanos or shoot it so a few times I´ve ended up dead  .

One very strange thing was when I charmed a LifeBleeder at the NW mine. It died after sometime (to many hits from Mutants), but it still was my pet and it hang just behind me all the time (No hit points). Then suddenly it started hitting me and my bot (Charm stopped). I was 10 hit points from being kill by a dead LB .

Plz look it to this problem !! It has started after the last patch.

I can back you up on the Hammer problem... i was using a QL 133 hammer until the great 13.8/13.9 patch. Now all the sudden i'm freakin Jackie Chan. The beam is not affected by this problem and in fact i'm thinking of switching to the beam now that i have had some time to play around with it... i currently have a QL132 on and my high hit is 1893.

Darkbane @ 3/5/2002 1:19:56 PM (14061):
A related issue is that the effect does not always end when you remove them, and if you put them back on again in this situation, the effect is applied again - very bright! Haven't tested this recently, but there has been nothing in recent patch notes.

Darkbane @ 3/5/2002 1:31:42 PM (11049):
Which means the client and server are out of sync... Hmm? Your explanation makes sense, it is pretty clear that some processing occurs at the client and the rest at the server. In an ideal world, all processing would occur server side, with the client just collecting and forwarding user input and processing and displaying server commands. In practice, some of this load needs to be at least simulated on the client. I'd guess that as AO currently stands, too much is done client side. Whilst this may ease lag/latency/packet loss issues, it can result in de-sync, and AO seems very bad at correcting de-sync at times...

Dareus @ 3/5/2002 2:14:06 PM (14144):
Only problem Valis is that the GM's say that the server hasn't logged a crash.

The end result and the notification to the client though really seem to be a server crash or reset.

I've sent a bug report and referenced this thread so if you've had this problem add your 2 cents.

Respawned missions - this would seem to indicate that problems are not with anyones connectivity, rather the server load is the problem. Spending an hour to clear a mission and approaching the mission reward only to have the mission respawned, one then dies on the way out of a once cleared mission losing all experience. This is a very large bug as well and is a "game-stopper" as it makes one playing not enjoy the experience.

- After a server crash, all mobs are respawning. You're surrounded by them and killed when you log in. Please, in case of server crash, make us respawn outside the mission area !

I get in as soon as possible (5 mins later) to find all pets gone, and all of the mission space RE_POPULATED with mobs I killed before. The map is, "of course" gone and lost, so I miss the exit while running out by some 2 rooms more, dying 3 m from the exit door. Such fun! FUN COM or FUn CON? heh

what the problem is for you if not NCU space, but your anatomy lesson line does stack with the general rifle and aimed shot buffs, if that is what you are asking.  At least, mine does.

Archu @ 3/5/2002 4:08:34 PM (14015):
If you order the heal pet to go on behind or follow mode before switchig heal targets, the chance of a succesfull target switch increases greatly. I'd still like it more if the pet would just interrupt the healing process and restart on the other target. Right now it has to finish the casting of the perivous heal before it can switch. No abortion of execution here.

Krneki @ 3/5/2002 4:13:30 PM (13852):
He is saying that his Weapon Enhancement buff doesn't stack with Anatomy Lesson line of buffs. Prolly same way other +dmg buffs don't stack with general. 

Deprive/ransack are just like crat stablle/unstable charms....you can cast both, but one has a huge resistance (which is busted anyway hehe) penalty so you can have 2 pets, not just 1.

Yes, I am getting disconnected from the internet. Then I can't reconnect through the game client even though the dialup connection window pops up. So I have to connect again after having closed the game client.

I play DAOC and never have a problem. I checked the AO FAQ and they recommended the email being open if this happens, but it doesn't seem to make any difference.

My ping indicator is always yellow. I will see what the color is once I close the email program.

I have been thinking about DSL for a while, it may be time. Something that is always on can't get disconnected it seems to this non-computer savy person.

I am going to check my modem settings to see if the Enable idle disconnect is checked too.

Champagne @ 3/6/2002 2:25:11 AM (14096):
Hello!

I experience the same disconnect problem you describe, only it doesnt happen alot. What does occour more frequently though, is client crash without internet disconnection. I usually never crashed b4 the 13.8 patch, but instantly after the patching, zoning took 50 times as long as b4, and I always crash when trying to crid; both when gridding in, AND out...!

Missions are VERY difficult to do well anymore.. Team missions at least. What happens is that I now take 2-3 minutes to zone in mission, and when we get i.e. a bad pull, we zone out (I use 2-3 mins to zone back out, while my friend zones in 3 seconds), he has already zoned back into missionroom long b4 I am finished zoning out of mission room for the first time, and he might get killed, or I can get killed - handling mobs alone isnt easy.. And it isnt fun either, when I have to zone all the time - I COULD handle it when it only took me 5 seconds (that was the time I used to zone untill the 13.8 patch), but now that it takes me MINUTES (and often with a crash) it is almost unbearable!

NOTE: I am on a 56k dialup modem, while my friend is on a adsl connection. B4 the patch my friend was actually the one who used longer time to zone, but only a couple of additional seconds. Now it is me, on a modem, who uses longer time to zone - but with MINUTES!

I HAVE the latest drivers both to my 3d card and sounddrivers. I have the latest direct x drivers. I use win 2000 pro. I cant understand what is wrong. I hope tomorrows patch, 14.0, will help!

Sincerely,
Aforce

PS! IF you live in norway, then perhaps you should reconcider getting yourself an adsl connection, as it seems to be unstable atm. Alot of the time my friend crashes without any reason, and is disconnected for many hours b4 being able to log on again.
At least that is a problem I dont have on my 56k modem.

BlackoutGrey @ 3/6/2002 2:31:10 AM (14154):
I still have a problem with it if it does not fix the bug where you get the mob down to 20 percent health and then can not hit them anymore.  Last night a yellow/green was at this point in battle and my health was almost at max. He not only chopped down my health but ended up killing me because I never hit again. (For over a minute I did not land one blow.) 

That is agro-vation.

Antiphon @ 3/6/2002 3:55:06 AM (Creature is dead but keeps attacking 14305):
I have been playing for some months now and I have experienced lag on many occasions.  Its part of the game but this latest incident I have been experiencing on a regular basis has never occured before until the most recent patch.  I target a mob, sometimes my weapon fires once but does damage several times(like I hit seven times with one shot).  The mob's hit point bar is totally depleted and my character ceases to attack and yet the creature keeps attacking and doing damage.  I try to continue to attack but a message appears saying that the mob is dead unfortunately the mob is still doing damage, so far its just been an annoyance but could prove deadly.  I love the game, keep up the hard work and I know that eventually this minor problem may be addressed.

Ashuras @ 3/6/2002 6:18:54 AM (14154):
BOG, I concur with many of your observations.

Zoning now takes a LOOONNNG time compared to a few patches age.

Are the zoning servers overloaded ? Or did some new code cause problems ?

There is a big problem with client/server sync. Combat messages often arrive too late, or in the wrong order, etc.

In many occasion I see a whole chain of my hits, then mob dies, but I see the mob standing there still. A while later, I see a whole chain of mob's hits (on me), the mob dies. 

And when teams do missions, the problem of losing sync with teammate is getting worse. We often lost "sight" of them even when we are supposed to be standing in the same location. ONly zoning out and in (and lose the map in the process) could cure this.

Is AO getting overloaded ? Or did u guys add in some new net code to counter some exploits (from client server sync problems) ?

AnotherFixer @ 3/6/2002 7:02:53 AM (400 Token board...missing a stat 14318):
Looks like the 400 token board is bugged.  It's missing the 1% projectile damage it is supposed to add.  In it's place it just says

315 missing

I don't know if the actually damage increase IS there or not and its just a text mistake, or if they are really bugged.


Regardless, FC, how about looking at the 400 board anyhow.  They should add more HP and Nano than the bloody 250 board does.  How about upping it to 500 HP and Nano eh?  The 1000 board does 750, makes sense that the 400 board should be inbetween.

Started a new character the other night, everything was normal until I reached the naming area. Just for fun, I decided to try to chat up one of the nurses...somehow I walked through the pane of glass and was in the NPC area! I walked around the area until I found a door...when I tried to use it the game locked up (probaly since there isn't anything back there.) 

The game crashed then, and when I restarted I was still in the "hospital" area with no exit. I petioned at that point, and the ARK that appeared was quite suprised to see me in that area. Fortunately, he got me back where I belonged safe and sound.

Has this happened to anyone else?

Last night I lost a krysknife.  Not as bad as a plane, sure, but I'm more worried about the fact that items CAN be lost.  Here's what happened:

Had krysknife in my pack.  Some nice person wanted to buy one, I asked why, she said "Cause it looks cool."  So I think "Hmm, what does it look like?"  Try to equip it from pack, doesn't work, put it in main inventory, right click to equip it.  Check myself out in 3rd person.  Chat for a bit.  Right-click to equip my pistol again in preparation for selling the krysknife.  Crash.  Log back in.  I'm in my plane (which I had gotten out of LONG before) which I think is weird.  My pistol is equipped.  The krysknife is nowhere in my inventory or any of my packs.  I don't know the exact time of this it was around 11pm-midnight Pacific time.

I petition, 72 people in front of me.  Go run the biggest mission I've ever seen, takes me till after 1am...now 51 people in front of me.  Then comes the announcement "All servers going down in 35 minutes please logout."  Nice way to make me stay up forever waiting for a petition without answering it....

I'm not too upset about the krysknife.  I'm worried, though, that this can happen and people don't get their stuff back.  A good friend of mine lost his PLANE a few days back.  

LOG this stuff, for NODROP if nothing else.  PUBLICIZE how logging is done so everyone knows what is and isn't possible.  Publicize your reimbursement policy so that GMs know what they're supposed to do and so do players.  People get incredibly angry when they lose something they've worked so hard to get, and "Sorry that happens" is not OK.  It happens, sure, you need a plan to handle it when it does.

Strycker @ 3/6/2002 8:39:50 PM (13596):
First off, I agree damage below min. is a bug assuming the
mob isn't protected by a damage reduction shield of some
kind, eg the soldier (non-mirror) shield line for example.

Since same-aligned mobs in high level missions tend to
fling their buffs around to mobs in nearby rooms quite
promiscuously, it is actually pretty common for me to
run into mobs with all kinds of shields up. I really hate
room mazes with a reasonable percentage of
adventurers, because it means pretty much everyone in
the level is going to have a damage shield. Anyhow, my
point is that in many cases, this isn't a bug it's a feature.

Secondly the HE thing is annoying too. Definitely a bug.
These days, though, I don't even use it, because I have
to recharge after every fight anyhow, and I don't have
enough NCUs for the damn thing. If HE was fast enough
to recharge me in a minute say, I'd use it, but it is useless
IMO for solo missions, since I typically use 3 recharges for
a random yellow mob anyway (assuming 2 calms). HE
is a fine buff for other lower rate nano users like traders,
mas, docs, mps, etc. but it is quite lame for NTs, as far as I
can tell.



-Strycker OT NT 104 RK-1


PS: I'd recommend not using the fast DDs, btw, at
least in pvm. I prefer the 3.x/3.x ones like burning
quartet or impaling tracer at my level anyway. I use
a recompiler to get something like 650 nano init.

PPS: 20% mission? Gaah. I hope you're close to 1000
tokens, otherwise it seems like a major waste of time..
You say you are fed up not being able to solo, but I have
to say I can solo 50% at level 104. Of course I need a lot
of calms, but it's quite feasible, even though I still don't
have a decent non-nuke weapon.

Accourding to the three websites that I've found that list the requirements/rewards for tokens boards I should have "Late Night" for having over 120 tokens.  But I don't, I have "Blossums of Summer" for recieving 60 tokens.  I have title lvl 2 and well over 120 tokens.  Why isn't my board upgrading when I right click on it?  Is this a bug too?  Have they promised us boards that don't exist?  Or are all the sites just mislabeling the boards?  If it's a bug then I quit.  I thought having a high lvl board would make an NT fun/useful, but I can't seem to upgrade it.  Maybe it's just NT's?

Cz finally gave us a little bit of information on this after us asking about it for weeks. Seems that the raise in Psy wasn't showing up on the visual nano resistance. He was going to check and see whether the nano resistance check was made against the right number or not but never got back to us on it.

Personally I think this is why very, very, very few characters ever resist a nano. It is doing the check against a number that is a LOT lower than it should be given our attributes.

Misophist @ 3/7/2002 12:03:19 AM (Health/nano bar bug, very weird. 14504):
Okay, I notice a lot of weird bugs in AO, but this one is truly goofy. So far it has happened twice, on two different accounts and affected the nano bar during one instance and the health bar another time.

Instance #1.
Was buffing a friend with Mocham's using another friend's account and high level meta. Had to use a nano kit to cast them. I sat down, used a kit... and nothing happened. I saw the animation, the aura of light, but nano pool stayed the same. After zoning, etc., I figured I'd have to relog to fix this problem. However, my friend teamed up with me and used a nano kit on me and that worked.

Instance #2.
In a team mission with a bunch of people, playing my own meta on my own account. Get hit for 600 a couple of times. When I sit down to use the health kit, nothing happens. I see the animation and aura, but my health doesn't change. Still at half. I tried putting my heal pet on me, but nada -- said it was healing me but nothing changed. Tried to get a teammate to use his health kit on me, and that did NOT work.  I could have logged off, but we were getting good exp. and I didn't feel like wasting time. I just let the points creep back naturally.

So my question is this: has anybody else had this problem? It's not a visual bug because my team-mates could see on the team-tab that my health was just above half. It's just really weird and only started happening to me about 2 days ago. Any ideas? I don't know if there's some connection with the meta profession or what. I doubt it.

"The logs aren't very good"

I enjoy the game but when you are rooted for 15 mins at a time for 3 times in a team mission the fun seems to go out of it.

Has anyone encountered the problem of cannot scrolling the item menu or it¡¦s so hard you have to press the mouse button 3 or 4 times in order to work; especially after looking at one item¡¦s info?

Rentrox @ 3/7/2002 7:29:54 AM (unequiping my rifle when i zone 14553):

BrutalThug @ 3/7/2002 10:43:40 AM (13975):
well they probably dont have the ressources to give back lost items... it would require alot of looking thru logs and then spawning the items.. and off course the log all items.. its server stored.

If they could do it any easy way i bet they did !!

Wonder why they dont just say "NO we dont reimburse lost items" right away when getting a "i lost my stuff" petition.

Chill @ 3/7/2002 10:56:14 AM (biomech cloak graphic bug 14571):
The coat doesn't show once we zone after having equiped it. We just look like we are only wearing our regular armor.

deanco2 @ 3/7/2002 12:10:04 PM (14061):
ImaGideon, that was the problem.  Checking the box made them work.  I can also see smoke now, rising from the pipes in downtown Tir.  Thanks for the heads up.  I'm wondering if this bit of info shouldn't be in a FAQ somewhere.

The problem is, that checkbox is called 'Others effects', not 'Other effects'.  When I read 'Others effects', I think, 'Eyecandy on other players which I can turn off without affecting gameplay'.  When I read 'Other effects' though, I think, 'Uh oh, I dont know what those effects are, I'd better leave it on.'

I think just taking the 's' off would make that option much clearer.

Whenever I buff my bot (crat bot), and then zone, he loses his buff.  I can tell because he doesn't have the "glow" anymore.  This is getting a bit annoying and I want to make sure it's the game and not my setup.

Also, sometimes my pet is still around, but he is invisible...

That's about all I can come up with for now.

Rodstaff @ 3/7/2002 2:16:16 PM (Chain Nuking In Full Effect 14590):
I could swear the patch notes for yesterdays patch said there would be no more chain casting much less chain nuking!  My whole team of six was whiped out in less than one minute but a veteran exterminator.  Not only are they insta-casting this nano, but there is no way they should have the nano-pool to NUKE 6 team members 3 times each.  Back before they tried to fix anything you could see the durn nukers actually have to charge up and at least had a chance to run, now its 2500 damage nukes insta cast over and over and over till were all dead.  The stupid mob doesn't even think about using small attacks or roots or pistols anymore.  Seriously though, if these mobs are fixed, if this is Funcoms way of keeping us out of missions then how about a:

Yes- This is supposed to happen!

or

No- We are aware and this is a bug.

Cos how about a reply pls sir.  Thanks

Rodstaff @ 3/7/2002 2:21:46 PM (13975):
ZONE ! I will do this all the time now when trading important stuff.  My friend and I lost a full set of 80ish elite 2 days ago who OMNI ent crashed.  If only we had zoned.  Oh well.  Besides, if they gave everyone there stuff back they would spend all day answering petitions about getting there stuff back.

Psilex @ 3/7/2002 2:23:26 PM (14530):
Yes, and it bugs SOOOO BAD!  It's even worse in the nano-formula menus.  I wish they would fix that

Psilex @ 3/7/2002 2:28:49 PM (14336):
What bugs more is the monster nano resist.  Why should we, as NT's, pass fumble checks (similar to hit/miss with gun) but then also have a nano resist check that is really high with most monsters...I hit MAYBE 50% of the time, if I'm REALLY lucky when I go against higher level monsters than myself.  I see this as an unfair dis-advantage to us NT's.

Hukk @ 3/7/2002 2:29:28 PM (14530):
I've found that when it sticks, if you roll the mouse wheel really hard, it unsticks. But then you scroll past a whole bunch of stuff, as well...

Psilex @ 3/7/2002 2:30:18 PM (14530):
Yea, and that's the part that bugs

starknaked @ 3/7/2002 3:50:10 PM (14318):
The 400 token board sucks.  There is no reason to go above 250 unless you are shooting for 1000.

You would think the 400 token board would offer some bonuses above the 250, but it doesn't.  At least, no meaningful bonuses.  It adds like +1 more to your attack rating and your defense rating.  Whee.

starknaked @ 3/7/2002 3:51:15 PM (14571):
Consider yourself lucky.  You are one of the few players in the game who doesn't appear to be wearing a dress.

starknaked @ 3/7/2002 3:53:22 PM (11769):
Megamet, you can just cast Throwing Knives Inefficiency or Burst Incompetence or any other such nano on yourself, it cancels the root.

And, yeah, the leet animation is a bit bugged.  But this is not really a problem.  You want to see the little leet run, back up.  You want him to stop, jump in the air and then you'll slide around.

Gaijinjr @ 3/7/2002 3:57:05 PM (Is this a bug ?!!??! 14604):

Divillian @ 3/7/2002 5:02:08 PM (14305):
i killed a guy once and he still stood there attacking. Animation and all when I tried to nuke him/attack him i got cannot execute hostile nano, target is dead or Cannot initiate fight. Within a few seconds he healed for about 3 hps and i nuked him again. So i got the exp twice for killing the mug. Made my day. Then one time i got disconned in a mission and when i reconnected all the treasure and mobs had respawned after i had looted/killed them all so again I got all my exp twice and loot twice. Needless to say it was all worthless loot, lamps and trimmers however there was cash....lotsa cash...

Divillian @ 3/7/2002 5:04:28 PM (14504):
it is a bug and has been one for a very long time. I myself have lost a many Health/Nano kits to this bug which has gotten very expensive. FIX PLEASE FC

It's odd that I've just noticed this personally within the last few days. But... it happened to my boyfriend last night, as well, and probably was the reason he lost nearly 1 million experience points . So who knows? Definitely weird.

Obstructed @ 3/7/2002 6:40:52 PM (14318):
Yes, I am shooting for the 1k board.  I will just finish farming at lvl 50 becuase they changed the rules and made it more profitable to do it then. I talked to a GM yesterday (Karmacappa or something) and he confirmed that the board had a 'typo' in it and I would get it at title level 3 instead of 2.  Unfortunatly that typo has been there as long as I've been playing AO (5 months) and the GM's know it's a typo.  Is it still a typo if they have been aware of it for months?  Or is calling it a typo after all this time just a great excuse not to fix their bugs?  Anyway, with over 400 tokens I hope I have 'Sunrise' at lvl 50 (and I will begin to token farm again, shamelessly).  I hope the 400 token board is not a typo as well.  Does someone have it at lvl 50?  Can you confirm please?  

--As an aside I still love AO and live on Rubi-ka, not earth  (space cadet?)

M@hdi @ 3/7/2002 8:16:26 PM (14571):
still I look like a patchy rug every time I zone and since bright biomet and shining biomet go into the same slot as psychic a doc like me is kinda forced to look that way 

It sux not getting a fix right in one go, but.....one gets used to it..

Obstructed @ 3/7/2002 8:19:24 PM (14336):
Agreed Psilex.  Totally agreed.  We as NT's have to pass more checks for a successful hit vs. monster than other professions with our main weapon.  The argument has been raised that we as NT's can wrangle on guns just like anyother prof, but it would be a secondary weapon.  Of course we can, this is obviouse.  What isn't obviouse to non NT's is that to use a gun in our lvl range we have to seriously cripple or ignore all other skillz.  That means no Nano programming, low complit, low abilities, and then we are right back to being crap again.  Point 2: You can't fire a gun and cast a nano at the same time successfully unless it's your first shot in player vs. monster.  If the monster hits you first you don't get to use your weapon unless you stop casting your nanos.  I have built an NT to use only nanos and weapons, forget trade skillz, forget good armor, forget map nav, lock picking, EVERYTHING.  And I only use my shot gun (a one skill weapon) 1/5 of the time in combat or less.  I believe this negates the "You can use weapons too" argument.  Of course we can, if we want to cripple our characters more than Funcom already has.

All I ask is to 1: be able to resist nanos 25% of the time if my skill is maxed.   2: Be able to hit monsters more than 70% of the time if my nano skillz are maxed/implanted/badass.  That's my job in life isn't it?  Don't take that away.

Cable modem, Win2K, 768 megs RAM, 1.4 Gig CPU, 64 megs Video RAM.  I don't think the long zone times are on my end.  I never had zonning problems before last patch. (5 sec zones) Now it takes me 90 secs to zone.  On the other hand, you just have more fingers, the guy I always team with is on dial-up (poor fukr) and used to zone poorly but now zones in 5 secs.  He's stoked.  So it's proven that whether or not you have a fat pipe Funcom can make it so you zone fast.  But why can the digital connection peeps do it one patch and not another, and vice versa for analog connection peeps?  In all honesty I don't really care about dial-up problems, just as long as I get to zone fast again in the near future  :}

Loxt @ 3/7/2002 9:11:47 PM (14337):
Well FC has decided not only to not reimburse the items, but has also placed a flag on my account due to the explicit nature of my petition regarding the loss (guess they didn't like my temper tantrum, I'll make a note to be all sweet and cheery next time .|..  ..|. ).

Anyway, Greatthor is now leaving AO. What a crappy, crappy situation... took him a month to earn 2.5 million credits so he could afford the equipment that he lost in a single server crash. Sure he could just borrow the credits from someone, or get hand-me-downs from other players, but that doesn't make that awful feeling of being brutally raped go away.

FC obviously has no interest in addressing this issue. Other games have had no problems with checking logs and returning lost items, and those games did not have a monthly charge. Seems FC is disinterested in the player base, only interested in gaining more new players so they can make more first-sale profits.

I really like this game, but I hate what Funcom has made it into. So many major issues are continually left unaddressed, so many broken gameplay aspects that we have all come to accept them as normal. I fully expect to lose items of great importance to me every couple of months. I fully expect each new patch to be worse than the one before. I can count on MoB's being different, on stores populating differently, on some major bug that doesn't get fixed for at least a week after it's introduced by yet another crappy patch. I can count on not one single FC employee to answer this post, also, unless to say that "cross-posting is not allowed" ..|.

I'm not sure that I can take much more of this... AO was supposed to be a game, not an exercise in frustration. What happened to having fun while running around and smacking things? Why is it so impossible to keep the game running smoothly like it did for so long during the 13.5 version? Why does each new patch always break more than it fixes? And why oh why is there no way to track and reimburse lost items?

I guess we will never know...

Sincerely yours, 
Loxt - betamonkey ..|.

cson @ 3/7/2002 9:18:20 PM (14305):
Is this not happening to everyone? Can we have a poll to see what percentage of the population that this is happening to? I'll bet it's near 99%. And if that's the case, why wasn't it addressed during testing?

Is it going to be fixed, or is it a permanent thing now that everyone just has to deal with? How the hell did AO win some award for some best game? Who wrote in an article that AO has improved? Ok, so it doesn't crash every 30 minutes anymore, but it's still so damn screwed up.

cson @ 3/7/2002 9:21:38 PM (14590):
This is a good time to solo 50% missions for tokens. Chain casting seems to be much worse now. All mobs in all missions are chain-casting. Or I'm just unlucky and only rolling crappy missions with chain-casting mobs.

G-money @ 3/7/2002 9:34:12 PM (14589):
AFAIK it's always been like this.  You'll notice you're pet also says "Hello master!" or whatever when you zone.  It's as though you re-summon him after zoning.

rakhabit @ 3/7/2002 9:57:56 PM (11769):
I've noticed through experience that the bugged animations only happen if you have a weapon equipped. Remove your weapon, and the animations will be normal. Of course for overequipped people, that isn't really an option.

Pavaroso @ 3/7/2002 10:31:05 PM (13973):
Ok, speaking of chests with vehicles... my girlfriend and I have been playing a couple of weeks now, and we're both 51.   I am a doc, and she is an adventurer.  She worked up the skills for disarming traps and breaking and entering, and has been looting all the chests.  In the time since we started, we have uncovered eight vehicles.  Of those eight, six were in locked chests.

The problem : I have never been able to open a chest after she unlocks it.  And,  I can't unlock it either.  When I try to open it, it says 'it is locked' and when I try to unlock it, nothing happens (you don't get the 'you failed...' message and the chest does not open).  Is this the way it is supposed to work?  Only the person that unlocks a chest can loot it, or are we doing something wrong?

Loxt @ 3/7/2002 11:35:08 PM (14590):

This has happened to me at least 5 times since 13.8 was installed.  It happens with different characters, mission types, and when in teams and solo.  I did a general poll of my guild last night and most everyone has experienced the same thing.

THIS BUG NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY!

Missions are the crux of this game, but what's the point of doing them if a) you can never complete them and b) to add insult to injury, you lose all the xp you earned?!?

Kodiene @ 3/8/2002 3:59:14 AM (14504):
Isn't this a Technical forum? 

Is a Funcom employee/rep supposed to help us here? 

Do I have to send /pet after /pet about this health issue?

My issue w/the health is that the bar since last patch lies! It shows me at 75% and in 1 hit I die and lose 250k xp? 

Is this a known bug? It is now. Only if someone in the company takes a look in here:/

Rauka @ 3/8/2002 3:59:31 AM (14144):
It's happened to me atleast 5 times now. Just since the patch that was supposed to fix MAs.

Just abit ago before I logged off in disgust. 1.8mil down the tubes.
Everyone in the team got disconnected said server error and the mission had reset.  What a way to make to everyone in that team log off in disgust.

For higher level people, missions is about all there is to do, now you gotta deal with this misson reset bug? Fix it before I throw this game out the window. Its pissing people off enough to want to quit. Think about it...only thing to do.....can't complete a mission, all you do is lose xp, makes everyone grumpy and pissed off. You are not going to keep pissed off and grumpy people playing this game.

That is one of the most ignorant statements I have read in a LONG time. (even counting Derisor's)

Ok.


There is a thread on here already, and I suspect that this one will be ignored like the rest.

I like this game.

I have always liked this game.

My class has been only slightly screwed (rage nerf) and overall I am very happy.

I have NEVER considered quitting the game.

EVERY SINGLE time I play I am in a mission that crashed (once per night) I lose between 1-2 mil XP every time, not a lot most of you say, but it is an HOUR OF MY LIFE.

I am quite frustrated by this and it is sucking away my will to play the game.

Why should I pay $13 a month or whatever (clearly money is not an issue to me, but it's the principle -- means so much more) for a game that simply pisses me off every night before I go to bed?  Answer: I shouldn't.

If this is not fixed asap a lot of people will get fed up and leave.  Nothing more disenheartening than working an hour or three and losing all that work because YOU HAVE A BUG in your game.

Sincerely,
A player who has lost another 1.2 mil XP.

PS: Oh, and if you don't know what bug I'm talking about, it's the one where the mission crashes and all the mobs respawn, and you are IN THE ROOM with all the respawned mobs, and you DIE right away, even though you CLEARED the room out before!!!

Mac @ 3/8/2002 5:03:23 AM (14144):

You know what Hobbes? I think FC can manage that even without your help. So with you giving a helping hand i think the two of you might even manage to quadruple the lag. How about it? You up to the challenge bud?

Heck you might even manage to make the game unplayable.

Serious mission bug

Castoroil @ 3/8/2002 7:19:34 AM (11049):
I've seen this happen multiple times in team missions.  It has nothing to do with lag.  An invisible mob will attack, but the victim doesn't know anything until they keel over.  The rest of the team goes "wtf?!?" and runs for the zone.  The one time we didn't have to zone was when the engie's bot killed the mob right after the team member died, the bot walked out of the wall where it had been hiding, and we all got xp.  This only happens in the large rooms and mission type (cave, building, etc.) doesn't affect whether it happens or not.

If it was a lag issue, an entire team would not see (or not see, as the case is) the same thing.  Personally, I have a cable modem; and it's not Cox!  I'm on RK-1 if that helps.

Sheldon @ 3/8/2002 8:05:52 AM (14144):
The best part is when your engineer loses his slayerdroid that he had to get Mocham's to cast.  That's happened to us twice now.

This has happened to me 3 times in the last two days.. Arinia is right; it is UNACCEPTABLE to lose 3 hrs of your life to a bug in a product that's been out more than 6 months...

Why are we continuing to pay money to beta-test your product Funcom?

Psilex @ 3/8/2002 9:27:19 AM (14305):
When I first wrote that this barely happened; it had happened to me 1 time, but since then, it has definitely increased in occurence.  I don't necesarily get attacked my the mob, but I get alot of them standing up and refusing to die.  The only time I used to see this was when I was at arthur's pass...the reets there would get back up, chirp like 20 times in a row and keel over.  That was really fun, but this is getting less and less funny...

Chill @ 3/8/2002 10:44:50 AM (14571):
In fact the cloak has no special graphics at all, I remember when I put it on I was looking as if I was in full biomech armor (except for the helm, boots and gloves).

And this display bug doesn't bother me, I only mentioned it to inform Funcom

Greystar @ 3/8/2002 11:35:10 AM (14508):
It's the same as in Broken Shores, too many players.

The only thing they could do is add more save terminals and move them further apart from the whompa so the players scatter a bit. That's what they will do in BS next patch.

Ladeda @ 3/8/2002 11:41:46 AM (14305):
This happens to me all the time.... with almost every MOB.  And Since "Chain Casting" has not been fixed.  It also means that they will cast 2-3 nanos and shoot me before they die.

Ladeda @ 3/8/2002 11:48:57 AM (14590):
No cson you are not the only one!!  I do 50% missions all the time and I can normally handle even the Orange MOBs I find in some missions (aka.. 2-3 levels above me).  I can even tolerate the "Chain Casting" when it's Doctors and Fixers.  But when it's a pair of NTs or Traders it's almost impossible.  What makes it even worse is that the "casts" are instantaneous!!   And they did say they fixed this issue.

Seems the code has gotten pretty ineficient with all the messed up patches again.

Ladeda @ 3/8/2002 11:58:47 AM (13975):
I lost 6 bags of stuff just a few days ago.  One Instance in a long string of having FUCom **** my characters.  No they will not replace it!!  Because they don't have a clue what the terms "Customer Service" or "Customer Satisfaction" mean at all.  And they won't "get a clue" until they are put out of business by a competing product.    I can hardly wait for Star Wars Galaxies to arrive.  I certainly won't think twice about Leaving them and will probably be driven to quit before my current subscription ends.

Serena @ 3/8/2002 12:02:17 PM (12718):
There really is no excuse for it taking even one patch to fix. Items in your inventory and backpacks should be just like what you wear on your person armor/implants, once put in a slot it should stay there period. Could you imagin the uproar if your armor and implants magically rearranged themselves everytime you zoned?? 
Taking multiple patches to get it right is just inexcusable...

Champagne @ 3/8/2002 12:08:34 PM (2 bugs: QW / NCU error 14767):
The MP NF "Quantum Wings" is still broken - in the way that if the stats to use it arent met when zoning, it will terminate. I.E. I lack some points in matmet to use it, so I have to buff matmet mastery on my self to use QW. If the matmet buffs times out, QW will terminate when zoning, and I will take 1000+ fall damage when comming out on the other side of zone border. I find QW very unsafe to use, as it already is useless when doing missions around aggro mobs, since I cant cast QW insde the mission room, but have to wait untill I come outside to cast it - and then I will be KOS!


Also another bug: Often I have to zone back to buff myself, because halfway through my buffing procedure, I will get the ncu error message: "not enough NCU". This isnt a very bad bug, but irritating enough, since zoning after the 13.8 patch takes over 1 minute ( I run on a WIN2K os ).

RedSonja @ 3/8/2002 12:56:45 PM (14144):
I have to agree, it really can be annoying when this happens.
Stuck in the middle of a mission, no map, all rooms suddenly re-populated.
You've got to either fight your way out room by room until you find the exit, or risk knowing the route just to get out so you can re-start.
However.......
Who here can say that this bug has never been a bit of a "bonus" to them? 
I remember two missions where I was one or two mobs away from completing and this happening.
I then had a mission full of mobs waiting to be killed for XP & credits again (As we all know the XP, credits & loot you've already gained is kept).
All the chests were back, meaning I could walk out with 2x everything I'd already collected - Coats, Nano Cloaks etc.

Yes, I'd love to see this bug fixed, but once or twice it's been great for it to happen!

Merv DeGriff @ 3/8/2002 1:22:15 PM (Broken weapon formulas... 14775):
Made me a happy lil trader and tried to make some weapons.  None of the wepaons that used rifle kits would make it past step 2.  They all said "It is not possible to ..." Shotgun kits worked fine though...

Anyone else unable to make rifles?

Misophist @ 3/8/2002 3:00:04 PM (14504):
Something with the client and server is out of whack because not only are we *really* at low health and sometimes cannot see it, but no amount of health rechargers, doctor heals and and meta pet heals will bring us back up. We log off, lose the mission map (but this bug is NOT limited to indoors) and only then can we see our true health and use a medkit accordingly.

Yeah, I'd like to see a reply.

Ampris @ 3/8/2002 3:14:29 PM (14775):
Last I heard, there were many weapons that could not be built.  Not just rifles.

Sometimes the problem only affects certain QL ranges of a particular weapon.

You should make a list of those that do fail, what step they fail at and send that information to bugs@anarchy-online.com.

Hopefully this feedback will let them know how important this issue is to the player base.

I've canceled both of my accounts due to this bug and funcoms unforgiving policies.

I was actually denied by an ARK member being summoned out of the mission due to this bug.

I figure it's crashed, so much for the item, oh well atleast if I can get them to zone me out of the middle before I log back in I can save the Exp.

Nope, poor customer service (I can't believe these Norway people even understand customer satistaction anymore) prevented this simple request due to "Policy".

I've got a bug report it from what, now about 4 days.  No response.

I've got a ticket with customer disservice, 1 response in about a week and a half.

This is not "Customer service" this is a poor unforgivable cheap bad company tactic.

I personally couldn't work for a company with such a poor attitude and lack of professional ethics.

Ya know what pisses me off more? That NO ONE FROM FUNCOM WILL EVERY ACKNOWLEDGE OR REPLY TO THIS POST!!!!

Must be nice running off and screwing around, letting the cash roll in while they do absofriggenlutley nothing to fix this problem, or address that they exist...

I thought FC communication had improved... Where the hell is our answer on this FC? And why is this still happening after 3 months of reports on this very same issue? And there are a host of other answers we are looking for...

Again... silence....

There was a time when we felt like you actually paid attention, but if you say NOTHING AT ALL to any of our posts, we feel completely abandoned. At least give us a BS line "thank you for reporting this issue, are developers are looking into it." Just cut and paste this line into these posts, at least that way we know you may have read them...

hehe, that's pretty funny Cloudeh, and totally sad...

Hey, you ever feel like no one is working at FC anymore? Like all 4 people who work there just up and left for the month... I mean, we've not heard anything from anyone in several days now, and they have all that money from the stupid suckers who continue to pay $13 a month for a game that doesn't work... so they probably split to Maui for a "much deserved break" (sarcasm) and are working on their tans and such...

Hey, maybe I'm wrong, maybe they are up to their arses in reports and have a staff of 20 top-notch developers just wailing away on code trying to get it fixed, but we will never know, will we? All it takes is a teensy little reply FC... but then I guess you would have to CARE about your customers to do that :/

Loxt @ 3/8/2002 5:49:47 PM (13975):
That same night in Omni-Ent, a new friend of mine lost 2.5 million credits worth of elite armor and nanos, specifically a full Q89 set of elite armor, and 2 nano cyrstals - essence of behemeth, and challenger to behemeth, as well as a very hard to find Q51 bracer of growing flesh. He logged on his alt who had the items and handed the bag to me to give to his main character. He logged on his new character, who I handed the bag to, and the server crashed. 

I could tell it was a time-warp because when I logged back on the guys in my guild were exclaming "WTF??? I'm back in Lush?" where they had been 15 minutes before zoning into ent. Of course my friend's back pack was gone, not in my inventory or bank, and not in his on either of his characters.

I sent a VERY angry petition to FC, because I had just lost my Q200 beam 2 weeks earlier, and they told me at that time that there was nothing they could do about it, so I knew that would be their response again. My friend no longer trusts this game, and won't play. He will more than likely cancel his account, and I can't blame him. I spend most of my time playing it safe now, I only do transfers next to a save terminal and save right before and right after each transaction.

I don't trust Funcom, and I don't trust this game. My toon is a paranoid nervous wreck, always saving and relogging and running back to the first room of the mission whenever there is the slightest lag spike or freeze. I take extra precautions, I do only easy missions in case the server insta-crashes and I return to a mission full of mobs that I already killed.  The beauty of that one is you have no map so no way to know where the exit is...

Anyway I'm no longer angry, just neurotic... You know, it wouldn't kill FC to show a little more kindness and compensate all of us for this lost items, I think we really deserve it considering all the frustration they have caused with their multitude of glitches and problems. If they actually cared about their customers, this would be the least they could do to prove it.

What the hell is going on with this patch?

Three times in the last few days I've had mission which have been seriously messed up....

Novice Nanoshifter, Yellow to me. Should be killable. Yeah right. I can stay in the room for less than 30 seconds before I'm dead. Why? I'ts hitting double (124 and 124) for each attack and while doing this is CHAIN CASTING health freeloader.

Sorry to be rude but can't your idiot developers actually fix ANYTHING? How many goes do they need? the average seems to be 3 attempts.

Consider this a bug report and one extremely p---d off customer.

madeux @ 3/8/2002 7:13:00 PM (14710):
When I first started out on Rubi-Ka I heard all the whining and complaining of the people. Many people quit because of stupid bigs and other things like that. During that time I had no clue what they were talking about.I was happy in my own little world of AO. I was having fun just playing my caharcter and leveling up. But now it has hit me. I am a lvl 103 Soldier and am haveing a hell of a time playing him. First I need to find groups, that takes 30min for so, it all depends on the night. Next we need to get organized and out to the place we are going to lvl, add another 30min or so. Then you finally get to playing and some stupid bug happens and you die and lose XP. Was it worth all that time? On average just to get a little XP and maybe a level I must sacrafice about 3+ hours to AO. Somedays I don't have 3+ hours to play. I have gotten to a point where I am only playing my alt characters because it is just too much work to level up my 103. People do have lives and with all the bugs and other crap in the game, losing XP to stupid things can just drive you insane. 

Fix the bugs please, let us all keep our insanity.

Tolstoy @ 3/8/2002 7:19:06 PM (14144):
Have had this occur at least once every day I have done missions since 13.8.

The mission loses all state, so when the you and/or your team come back (at whatever intervals) from the disconnect, any buffs ran during the mission are lost, all pets are gone, and any mobs in the surrounding rooms are beating on you.  If you're not in the first room, it's very rare that anyone from the team will make it out alive unbuffed and uncoordinated.

Needs fixing.  BADLY.  I will not attempt to fight through another mission while this is still happening.

This is a big problem.  I sent in a petition about it and it was deleted with no response.  Until they get around to admitting they have a problem (another month?) and then fixing it (another 3 months after that?) I recommend blowing off all office, office-maze, and fireplace missions.  Stick with small cave and factory missions, it is at least less frustrating when they do crash because you only lose < 1 hour of effort.

The chain casting problem seems to be still present but it is better with latest patch.  HOWEVER you have now introduced a NEW BUG.

Just working on a mission now and in this mission, twice I have died from greens.  Both times I was hit with a DOT TWICE from the same caster.  I do not mean one after the other.. .I mean in my little status box, I now show TWO or THREE of the SAME dot symbols...  And instead of taking 75 dam from one over and over I now get this:

75 dam from poison
75 dam from poison
75 dam from poison
you were  hit for 200 points projectile damage
75 dam from poison
75 dam from poison
75 dam from poison
you were  hit for 200 points projectile damage

and so on until...

You have died.

No time to even heal.. Three separate icons appear in my status showing THREE separate active DOT effects from same NPC PLUS of course two different total roots at the same time.

I just do not understand... you claim to fix one bug but introduce 4 new ones???

Yes, if you start to get phantom hits, zone immediately.

Team was wiped out more than once in notime by this.

It seems to be fixed of late though, but it could be that the mission crashes and resets before this particular bug rears its head.

Last week, I took a mission for the first time since my heart attack ( 3 weeks lost playing time ) and the mission reset! I thought it was probably just a coincidence since I've only seen that happen ONCE since rollout. I guess it is now a "feature" of the game.

Luckily, I knew where the exit was and managed to make it out with about 20% health. Plus side was I was 10K CR and ~30KExp Richer!

Was playing in EFP last night with a group of people. Being an agent i would  let the pets attack while i went into sneak mode and fired off some 6k aimed shots ( all hail wrangles, mochams and UVC!!!) Anways i was sneaking aorund just when a mantis spawned next to me... you all know what happened next. 1-way trip to reclaim.  Just as I had poped up at reclaim i got killed a few times by wolves there. ( FC is your listening put come guards there to take care of the wolved THAT DONT GET OWNED)

I started walking and i realize i was stuck in sneak mode. I hit the H key and im still in sneak mode. Tried everything to get out of it but couldn't. Even getting into my yalm and /terminate didn't work.  So i was stuck walking/running at sneak speed until the zone crashed. On the plus side i was able to take the occasional aimed shot DURING a fight which was kind of funny for the hour or so it lasted.

Just wanted to know if people have ever had this happen to them.

I just upgraded from 13.8 to 13.91 and now my my mouse is acting all screwy.  

I'll be running straight ahead [with both my 2nd (move POV) and 3rd (run) mouse buttons down], and suddenly, my character stops, and I find my first-person POV instantly switches to straight up at the sky or straight down at my feet.  This only appears to happen when I am in motion, not when I'm standing still or sitting.

Everything was fine until I upgraded to 13.91.  I've had no mouse trouble in the game up until now, and my mouse seems to be acting normally in Windows.

The mouse is a Logitech TrackMan Marble PS/2.  It's the same mouse I've been using for years and I just updated the drivers.  Again, I don't suspect the new mouse drivers because the mouse works just fine in Windows, but not in AO.

Since level 20, I haven't been able to use Burst mode with my Mauser or my Solar Powered SMG from the starter equipment. I've spent 2 levels trying, and it's frustrating.

Everytime I try, I get the message, "Special attack not available." I was able to before and I have the skills to do this, so why can't I use Burst anymore? It's pretty important for my Fixer, as he has a hard enough time doing decent damage in a short timespan as it is.

As far as I can tell, it's something FUBAR with my character, as I tried two different weapons with identical results. Zoning and doing a logout haven't helped.

I don't want to have to take up someone's time with a petition, so I'll try here first. Any and all help would be appreciated.

Ming @ 3/9/2002 7:51:11 PM (14710):
When the zone server crashes what else can happen? What would the alternative be?  It makes me wonder. Missions are generated when you enter them I would assume. In other words, I don't imagine there are monsters walking around and buffing themselves when a mission area hasn't been chosen. Am I wrong here? It seems like that would be a huge resource hog. 

My assumption is when you hit "accept mission" they initialize. So under the current system, when the mission server crashes it just resets all missions. If this is true, when the mission server crashes it could just mark all missions as null, and you'd be back outside the mission with no key. Would people prefer that, or would they be more angry that they lost that mission?

FireC @ 3/9/2002 8:35:21 PM (14860):
Yeah, I have often had 3-4 exacly same slow or root nanos in effect at the same time. Happens rarely with DoTs but when it does it's bye bye for some of my characters as they simply can not heal fast enough.

I believe I once had sets of 4 slows, 4 DoTs, 4 slows and 4 DoTs again (I took screenies of that but can't be bothered to dig them up) when I ran accross two agents in a laggy mission.

Dareus @ 3/9/2002 9:52:22 PM (14710):
Not required Ming

It used to be that when the server had a problem it would reinit the mission leaving you in the entrace like you just walked in.

This is the correct handling of a server failure.

That said, Funcom has stated that the mission servers aren't crashing which I mention in the other thread.

Ming @ 3/9/2002 10:31:17 PM (14710):
Just based on my observations from test, as it is far less stable and has given me many more opportunities to observe than on live, the missions do not reset when you crash. They do reset when they crash. From what I'm hearing the server isn't crashing at all and yet the missions are restting? Havent seen this if that is what is being proposed is happening.

Dareus @ 3/9/2002 10:36:32 PM (14710):
Exactly, the mission server (hardware) isn't crashing, but you are disconnected due to server problems.

Not like a client crash where you would still be logged in when you came back.

I am not sure since when this started, but I would say after the last two patches. It takes me between 10-20 seconds to enter a building, to zone. Before everything was fine, only a few seconds, but now this is constant, always the same amount of time to wait.
I do not think it could be related to my connexion, since nothing changed (adsl running fine for everything).
Today I was playing with somebody in a team, and he was playing with a 56k line, and he had time to enter/go out two times while I was entering!!! How is it possible? What could be the reason for this?

Bot's hitpoints go up.  Bot's hitpoints seem to WRAP back down, negatively, for the full trimmer value.

(*** Remember how if you hit a mob too hard, they'd actually gain hitpoints sometimes? hmm.  coincidence? ***)

My teammate freaks out.  On his screen, MY hitpoints have suddenly dropped to half.


We test it: He targets me, heals me back up to full on his screen, and then I hit the trimmer again on my bot.  My hitpoints plummet again on his screen, although I'm perfectly fine.

Biffstatsnugly @ 3/10/2002 8:03:10 PM (15055):
From what i can tell the trimmer divert e to hp dont give the hp anymore they just give the max hp a boost now. It was not always this way and has changed this last patch. Sorry to let ya know. Freaked me out the first time or 2 as well.

Biffstatsnugly @ 3/10/2002 8:09:42 PM (14710):
Had this BS happen to me last night... Full Team, Me w/ a slayer. Mission totally crashes. I relog almost immediately so my bot dont time out. Log in and no bot, no team, full mission of 200 lvlMOB's. ACE mob blows my head off my shoulders. Good 2.7 million xp pissed down the drain.

Biffstatsnugly @ 3/10/2002 8:15:41 PM (14508):
wont get a answer i fear. This happens all the time the whompa is horrible due to all the players you discon... about 33% of the time you run thru it. Just have to wait to relog when you can.

PS. dont have a bot ready if you plan on keeping him summon him on the otherside if you make it thru the whompa.

Well Thx for any input, since it really bugs me i cant check stats, requirments, or what stuff does before i buy.

I've put my friends on my friends list a hundred times in the past, they keep on dropping back down to the HUGE list of all the people that ever gave me a /tell in game. The fact that they drop off is the bug, the fact that every idiot that gives me a tell goes on a list that goes onto MY screen is just an annoyance, it's a pain in the ass to look through all those names just to find one person that you were talking to a few minutes ago.

Whenever I try to submit a bug report in the game, running in full screen mode, it drops me to desktop and minimizes the game. After I submit the report and try to maximize my game I get totally game stopping graphic glitches, however, once in about every 3 reports or so I come back to the game on the 'roof' of wherever I'm at. If it is a mission I can see all the baddies, AND my mission goal and can walk along this 'roof' with nothing aggroing on me. I've reported this before and been told it was called 'roofing' and is a bannable offense, seems a bit absurd to take a chance on being banned just to submit the tons of pathing, mob, and other game related bugs

Isaah @ 3/11/2002 7:18:20 AM (14336):
You NTs get screwed kinda bad I think. I was grouping with an NT last night, she was casting like mad but was fumbling every now and then, getting countered a LOT, and even got interrupted a time or two by being hit. In all my levels I'm quite sure I can count on one hand the number of mobs my pet and I have interrupted, and will even have room left to count how many times I've actually countered a nano cast on me.

One other thing of note that you NTs are getting raped on is MOB resistance to Nanos. Their value is set INCREDIBLY high, far higher than a player of the same level could have, with some being even higher than others. One of our fellow posters says he and some friends are working on a semi-invasive program that can log factual numbers from server and client info during combat. Whether or not he can make such a thing remains to be seen, and I'm quite sure if he's caught he'll no longer be among the player base of the game  Seeing how that's not really my problem though I wish him luck, and hope that if he DOES get banned, that at least he can get that data out to the rest of us players.

Isaah @ 3/11/2002 7:21:30 AM (15137):
Not sure if this is 'frowned' upon posting or not, but those doors are bypassable when your up there. You just kinda have to work around them while staying up there, and from "what I've been told" you can drop down, unlock a door and go right back up too. Of course the getting up there part baffles me, I'd rather not be up there myself.

hmm...

The ring adds to DMS, it's a internal modifier, or value, for defence. (Defence Modifier S....???)

So what does it do?

As far as we can tell, DMS adds to all evades and resist rolls.
It doesn't show up as a figure though, aka you can't see your DMS in any way.

There is a AMS value also, that is used for attack.

I had the same problem, but now I create text files or just plain files with my macros in them.  For instance, pname could have "/macro Pname /pet rename DaemonSpawn" in it.  This would be executable to a quick button by typing /pname from chat.  This would then be dropped on my quick bar as usual, but will STAY there when I reconnect.  Try it..  All scripts go in the games' SCRIPTS folder (create it if it aint there).

Lilbob @ 3/11/2002 3:10:57 PM (14144):
THIS NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOW!!!!

this is are really REALLY anoying bug and it needs sorting NOW not next month its causing the higher lvl playerbase (myself and my guild freinds included) to get really frustrated and its also caused a lot of the higher lvls to put there accounts on hold or actaully leave the game

I suggest FC you emergency patch this and not wait about for 14.0 thatll be too late as most of the players will leave if this isnt fixed immediatley.

AS in FIX IT THIS WEEK dont leave it to rot its impposible for people to play the damn game if they cant do missions being one of the only ways to level passed 100.

not to mention the mobs registering hits after they die that needs fixing asap too! as that is enfuriating people as its killing them after its dead!! rendering fighting virtually impossible.

ITS EITHER FIX IT NOW OR LOSE THE PLAYERS!!!!
AND IM NOT TALKING ABOUT 1 or 2 IM TALKING THE WHOLE LOT!

I've been noticing since the 13.8 patch a lot of times while i'm in a store my frames per second will shoot up to 200 exactly then my character will move *very* slowly, in fact it crawls.  Then after a minute of crawling to the door (zone) it's back perfect again after i zone out. 

System:
P4 2.2Ghz
512 DDR RAM
64MB Geforce2

Any ideas on how I can remedy this? It's becoming a real nuisance, especially since it's implant shopping time!   With my system specs it should not crawl like that. Also note there is nothing else running except AO & Explorer & Systray and it only happens in stores... Missions are fine also...

Thanks

Loxt @ 3/11/2002 7:04:43 PM (15139):
You know of course Funcom will never read this post... or at least never reply to it; but for the record, I concurr - this is a pretty stupid glitch. What makes it worse is that the friends list itself is a major pain in the ass to manage. 

I would love have a resizable pop-up window with a more practical file-directory structure so names can be group selected and drag-n-dropped into different sub folders etc. to manage the names, and some settings to adjust how new names are handled, and so forth. It would also be nice to have some ctrl-shift-# shortcuts assigned to different chat channels, so I can easily move between different chat lines without typing /g <username> etc. or use my mouse each time I want to talk to someone else. I'm always having to switch between team chat, guild chat, and private tells when online.

But what am I telling you this for? FC will neither read this post nor ever consider making such a change for the better. Oh but they will totally nerf everyone across the board with their proposed overequipping changes. For once I'd like to see them actually improve the game rather then continually break it...

Seriously folks, what's the point? FC is completely AWOL from these boards. Instead of relying on FC to fix their problems (which we know they neve will) let's discuss with each other tips on how to survive when the server crashes.

One method is to have a designated puller bring each mob in the mission to the main room for the rest of the team to take out. Make sure the puller has either Rage or a good speed buff, so if the server resets he can still outrun the respawn on his way out of the mission.

Another way is to do easier missions with smaller groups, so that if the server resets each member is able to either kill the respawned mob without too much difficulty or able to hold out until the other members return. To help facilitate this, the healer should keep each member at full health throughout the battle, and if the server resets, each player should endeavor to return as immediately as possible.

Someone said in another post that these forums are for the players, not so much for FC developers. So let's take control of these boards and start helping each other out, because we know now that FC is not here for us, nor will ever be. It's up to us now...

Nichito @ 3/12/2002 12:02:55 AM (Cant Join All Of A Sudden.....HELP ME!!! 15289):
Ive been playing this game for about 3, going on 4 weeks. Ive never encountered a problem like this before.

Last night, I was so tired, I didnt go to my usual table at Newland City's Bronto Burger to log out. I just grabbed a table where i was, inside the  Begginer General Store's Tradeing room. So I log on today, and start popping on nano programs, and building my android, then right when I walk outside, I freeze up. My whole computer freezes up, and nothing I can do helps me out of it. I cant ctrl+alt+delete to get a safe reboot, I have to hit the restart button and wait for it to scan my stinkin drives. Now when I try ti join, Im starting right in that doorway, and I freeze up every time.

I dont know whats doing this. I could see hundreds of people hanging out in front of the store, and was thinking maybe its the over population of the stupid Newland City store-fronts. In which case Im begging an ARK to warp me across town to bronto burger where its less crowded. My characters name is Thestash and he's an engineer right outside of the Beginner General Store in Newland City.

Or you can do me a favor, and get those guys to dispurse form the damn stores, and give me a chance to join the game SOMETIME today. hahaha

Well Im going to go beat the hell out of my matress untill I can join the game. Bye.

Nichito @ 3/12/2002 12:15:58 AM (15289):
I thought I could come back and just delete this poist but I couldnt. So Ill appologise instead.

I went back after posting that last post, and for the second time, I tried joining with a much lower resolution, and I was able to join. BUT, there were only 13 or 14 people in front of the stores, so I still feel it was due to the large Shriners Convention that seemed to be taking place there 40 minutes ago. hahahahaaaa.

Well sorry again. Ignore this and move on please. Nothing to see here folks.

Bye.

That is the perfect fix... This is all the need to do, to make everyone happy... If all the mobs have to come back this is the least they can do...

Isaah @ 3/12/2002 1:30:00 AM (Full inventory can disable 'right click' options. 15306):
Sometimes if you get the "inventory is full" message you will suddenly find that you cannot use Nano/Treatment kits, open chests, loot bodies, or any other effect that takes a single right click to activate. This has happened to me several times now, each time while in a mission, the last time it happened I kept trying to over-fill my inventory just to get the message and see if the bug would happen. It took a few times but eventually it did happen, so that means it must be reproduceable I'd figure. The only two ways I've found to un-bug yourself when this happens is to either log, or find a way to get the overflow window to open up, e.g. completing a mission and get a reward and token.

Krystka @ 3/12/2002 1:36:46 AM (14710):
I like that idea.  Spawn us in the entry room if the mission server crashes.

This is a BAD thing.. and it happenign way too much..  almost impossible to gain exp at high levels now..

Krystka @ 3/12/2002 1:38:45 AM (15272):
Well.. speaking from personal experience I have never had this problem..and I am in 20k and BS a lot.. 

But I do know a lot of friends who do have this problem..  not sure what causes it.  But if you do get stuck try petitioning..  them ARK's are darn good at getting your person out of that loop.   Until they figure out whats gonig on..  I think thats the best option.

Krystka @ 3/12/2002 1:43:05 AM (11250):
Might be vid card related I agree..  I have a Geforce and it works just fine.

Darkblood @ 3/12/2002 3:38:54 AM (15306):
and it's NOT just related to full ivnentory.

It happens to me EVERY GD FIGHT!!!!! in missions.

way around it is to target door target self buff self! THEN can I use right click option!

Zoning is also another immediate fix by why the freck would I want to zone and lose my gd map!

yet another **** bug that should provide enough reasoning for mission maps to be tied to the mission key (in that when mission is over map diasappears with the key) and being saved even if you zone out of the mission.


I have noticed some people saying they don't get it, but also others do. 

NFI on how to replicate it as it happens  ALL THE GD TIME! Thank christie I don't rely on health stims mid-battle anymore because that would be more XP (read RL time behind the XP amt) lost due to freck'd up BUGS!

Yes I am VERY pisssed off!

Ashuras @ 3/12/2002 3:47:29 AM (15272):
Yes... I got stuck in such a loop in BS over the weekend. 

Petitioned using a twink... ARK responded within 5 mins, and moved my stuck character to a less laggy spot to solve the prob.

Got back in with my main char in less than 15 mins.

The ARK team is doing a great job... and that was over a busy weekend too.

Annoying one this. Put new set of implants in and chked out my T&S lvl for bot casting and found that as planned could now cast Glad bot. Cast one and an extra casing, sociable a bit and then logged.
Came back on last night to find that my T&S skill had dropped by over 40 pts and that I could no longer cast the Glad bot (or the spare shell I had).

I would put it down to a duff implant build but this is the 3rd identical set and I chked the stats on them anyway.

Has anyone else had this after a new implant set?

Psyphen @ 3/12/2002 7:55:28 PM (14710):
It wouldn't be as bad if certain chests didn't disappear after the respawn.  I was in a mission and found a yalm, I crashed before I could grab it.  When I got back in, I thought it'd be ok because I was still happy about finding a yalm which I knew was there since the chest loots are static.  But, the chest with the yalm disappeared!  How the hell does that happen when the rest of the mission respawns exactly the same??  Grrr!!

Gvain @ 3/12/2002 8:59:37 PM (2 MOB Types need to be looked at... 15431):
I'm sure that there are issues with some of the others, but here are 2 MOB Types that REALLY need a good looking into.

MOB Doctors and Traders

Doctors - They seem to have a DOT or Heal that they cast that does damage to themselves as more often then not I don't get any exp for killing them.  This is representative of when a MOB is standing in toxic waste which does damage to them and if you don't get them out before you kill them you don't get the exp.

Traders - They are just insane to fight.  I've got them funneling for  150-222 damage to me, no idea how much they get back from it, on the average of 7 times a fight, not to mention the ransack/deprive they chain cast on top of the funneling.  They require an insane expenditure of First Aid kits even with HOT running to put them down.  And to add insult to injury they have > 100 credits, often none, to loot when the fight is over because they use them up casting apparently.  Oh, did I mention that they are shooting during all this as well?

EDIT:  Also, they create a serious amount of downtime while you have to wait for deprive/ransack to wear off.  Yeah, I realize that I don't "have" to wait for them to clear, but anyone who plays this game realizes that is it suicide to procede with those effects active.  Speaking of downtime, I've kept a record, of the MOBs that can root, 87% of them will cast that one hit before they die.  I've started saving a burst for the end of the fight with Rooters to attempt to avoid yet more downtime.

Y'all should concider taking the Trader MOB out of rotation till you take a good hard look at their abilities.

Additionally, it is really frustrating to see that the only Fixers that can cast level appropriate nanos are the Fixer MOBs.

Ruebben @ 3/12/2002 9:38:16 PM (Punching while wielding two swords 15445):
Hiya,

I just started a new Advent, dual wielding swords. First Equiped the character with a Cutlass and OT Sword, no problems. 
But when I started to use two OT Swords I got a third attack as a bonus. My char hacks and slashes with two swords and punches along with with it. Now I have only 17 points in martial arts (just reached level 15). I get a third attack bar and an animation is showed when punching.

Weird thing is that when I unequip a sword, all my special attacks disappear until I re-equip the sword I'm wielding at that moment. and I also punch while wielding one OT Sword. When I equip the second sword.

Now it sounds quite cool to punch while wielding two swords, but it's messing up my timing with an attack that does minimum damage...

Any1 else having these kind of problems, any1 know how to solve it (if it can be solved)?

Thanks, Greetz...

Ampris @ 3/12/2002 9:40:40 PM (15139):
The fact that they drop off is the bug, the fact that every idiot that gives me a tell goes on a list that goes onto MY screen is just an annoyance

The bug is any friend who sends you a /tell while you are offline will get dropped off of your friends list.

Ampris @ 3/12/2002 9:44:50 PM (15140):
Last I heard, until you log out properly any changes you made to your shortcut bars aren't saved.  So if you get disconnected during a session, any changes you made earlier would have been lost.

oldfartma @ 3/12/2002 10:03:33 PM (400 token board...as intended or bugged? 15451):
This seems very odd to me every token board adds nano and health with exception to the 400 token board (clan) soo we have to get 150 more tokens from the 250 board to get to the 400 board for nothing? if this isnt bugged funcom you should look into adding some hp and nano to this board as it dont make much sence to get this board other than its on the way to the 1000 board.

Isaah @ 3/12/2002 11:40:23 PM (15139):
Excellent info Amp! I didn't know what was causing it, maybe your info will shed a little light for anyone at Funcom that happens to read our posts.

Isaah @ 3/12/2002 11:47:25 PM (15140):
I never /quit the game, I always sit and camp. If I /quit the game I get 'blue screen' errors and have to wind up rebooting my machine. So even when camping out properly those macros can and do still vanish. The script idea wasn't so bad, however that leaves two choices 1. Make a macro to activate the script (and still deal with the vanishing macro issue). 2. Type the /script activation, in which case it may take just as long to type /pet attack, or similar command.

Bauxite @ 3/13/2002 12:25:43 AM (Hmm another old forgtten and ignored one, Biomech 15470):
This is a really old bug, but since they finally went around and fixed biomech cloaks (and nerfed them at the same time) I figured maybe they would fix this, but guess not.

No piece of biomech armor, be it helm body cloak boots gloves etc, adds the listed treatment and first aid bonus. In fact, this is a very old bug (as far as I remembe biomech NEVER gave the bonuses) but I'm getting really tired of it esp after logging on one of my old chars and wanting to redo them implants. Some doctor armor eh? It would be nice if they could wear a suit that we don't have to swap off just to wear implants, since a high ql biomech suit gives about the same bonus as a med suit. (+80)

Oh, and while we're at it, denerf the freaking nano and biomch cloaks. Either that, or finally get off your butts and nerf decus coats down to be equal. Or you could be more fair, boost nano and biomech cloaks up to the level of decus coats, AND give tank armor another 20% acs so people would not be LAUGHED AT for wearing tank, and the tank classes would think about swapping it on during combat. And give battle suits 6k at ql200, since -100 evades and run (and practically killing using your good nanos) is not worth 500 more acs than a 200 suit, but 1500 might for some classes (particularly if you can swap it on and off at will  or remove the social armor restrictions and have it give 50% acs that it does now, 7500 ac for 200 armor and a 200 battlesuit actually sounds ok in battle for crapped evades and 3x nano cost.

Bauxite @ 3/13/2002 12:45:46 AM (14775):
Sadly, most players could give a rats @ss about tradeskills except NP which is some mysterious thing they pay mps or someone else to do. (lots of people pay other people to do their implants, I teach another person about nanonanny every day now) There are a few people that use pharmatech, its not a bad skill for docs. Anyways, most of the weapons you can make are either already for sale/easy loot (hence low demand at best or NO demand) or are at best mediocre and at worst pieces of junk that no one over level 10 would be caught dead using. (actually, they would be caught dead, repeatedly, by every grey mob for 5 miles) Don't forget to make a weapon takes many tradeskills that have zero use for anything else.


Making a nano is far worse, and frankly NO ONE would make nanos if it wasn't for 2 nullity nanos and 4 grid armors nanos that never spawn as crystals.  Yes, there are non-store/above ql120 nanos that come as discs, but 15 minutes tops with aomd and you can find them in crystal form. Nanos over 120 take a boatload of IP in FIVE tradeskills (Mech EE QT NP comp lit) and for some of the steps you need a char with THREE tradeskills maxed, e.g. you can't spread the work across 5 characters in a guild. (at most you culd spread across 3 chars with each having 3 maxed tradeskills, but since one of the skills is comp lit, it will be 4 maxed for two of them, might as well make just 1 pure tradeskills char to save the agony....engy is ideal since trimmers are nice, as long as you're buddy buddy with a trader who has maestros as well, but don't worry the trader cannot afford to boost tradeskills at all like you can) Non store nanos, besides the two very rare exceptions, are so damn easy to get in crystal form compared to making them that no one bothers. I get people who hand me nice discs for free because otherwise they would dump them on the ground or sell to a vendor.

I managed to make a QL181 Fiddle rifle awhile back (its one of the few kits that DOES work, in general, assume a kit does NOT work until you *prove* that it does, this is what I would tell funcom if they listened or cared)...but check the stats on antiguardians, BLEH, junk. Now I hold onto it as a collectors item.

*BUMP*

Guess I've lost 2-3 mill xp the last two days because of missions crashing and resetting.

I'm not taking this BS anymore, fix it or I'm out of here.

LTK @ 3/13/2002 3:22:28 AM (14710):
*bumpage*

Feeling the same way.  Fix this problem, Funcom.  Please and thank you.

Now.

LTK @ 3/13/2002 3:29:49 AM (Bug Attack In Athen?  All Pun Intended!!! 15487):
Yup, giant bugs attack Athen.  I think "hey, cool."

I go in.  I join in the fight.  Wee.

After about 90 seconds of hardcore lag, everything cuts out.

Everyone disappears.  I'm alone in the world.  Can't sit down.  Can't heal myself (which I desperately need to).  Can't zone.

Everyone else has the same problem.

Oo!  Everyone's back!  For seven seconds.  Poof!  Gone again.

Things start to settle down.  People come back.  Lag is still there, and it's still impossible to sit down, cast, or zone, but the population is starting to see each other again.

What happens next?  THE BUGS COME BACK.  That's right, completely oblivious to the fact that no-one is actually able to DO ANYTHING right now because the entire server is locked from existence, whoever's in charge of this otherwise dramatic event has the brainiac idea to CONTINUE THE ATTACK.

I don't usually complain.  I happen to love this game.  But that was downright stupid.

Reset the servers already, FC.  Don't continue with the event as though nothing was wrong.  Lord knows that pressing the reset button is the only fix you've got for this type of problem.  You could at least use it.

porter @ 3/13/2002 3:31:09 AM (14710):
Didn't loose xp tonight and wouldn't really care that I died having just levelled during the mission, but I'd like to know what happened to my Maussers (2) that disappeared...

I had just equipped the new one having allocated the missing couple of IP to SMG and was planning on testing the new firepower with the rest of the mission when CRASH. When I log back, there I am fighting the same fight I had just won a moment ago, no problem, kill them again I think... But this time there's no gun in my hand. Both the new and the previous Mausser are gone, nowhere to be found, I die, guns do not reappear magically from the reclaim or any of my bags.

I guess I should have found a trader to buff me the new weapon instead of wanting to be able to self-equip.

Back to the point: no I generally do not like this reset thing at all even though on an occasion it has actually been useful, providing extra cannonfodder...

MooKids @ 3/13/2002 3:32:43 AM (15487):
I like how some ARK Greeters said that the Whompas were sabotages by Omni-Tek and that the Mantis used a "time and space displacement nano program."

The thing was cool, but I guess the servers couldn't handle it.  Too bad, that would have been fun.

Painsmaiden @ 3/13/2002 3:34:31 AM (14775):
If the recipes do not work they should NOT be sold. I wasted boatloads of money at a relatively low level to make a QL 30 Mausser. This particular recipe never even made it to the first step. SMG construction Kit will not combine with a same QL Nano Pylon. No messages, no errors, just nothing except for a headache and the anguish of lost money.

I say that HUGE nember of existing bugs need to be worked out before any of the stuff in teh 14.2 patch is even given one iota of thought. Make the game complete befor eyou nerf everyone into oblivion. Oh yeah, and fix the sync bug, it's getting to where it is very risky to solo, since you may take 4-5 hits after you kill the mob.

Quad @ 3/13/2002 4:02:07 AM (14775):
They need to rework the whole weapon making thing anyway. This different QL range taking a different formula was just too complicated for them to code properly. Plus its really just a needless pain in the butt that accomplish's nothing.  Well thats not true ... it creates a tremendous amount of clutter in the shop terminal that sell recipes. Making it real pain to hunt one down. 

I haven't heard anything from Funcom on weapon making. Looks like they are just going to leave the weapon parts as some sort of boobie prize loot ... like ammo.

Fludium @ 3/13/2002 4:09:59 AM (Trader Calm nano 15496):
Well....  I was out hunting robots one day, outside Athen, and all of a sudden I get attacked by Trash King. Now those of you who know what Trash King is, is probably laughing now, eh?

well as a matter a fact, I managed to calm him with my mez nano.

now this is all fine and dandy I think to myself right?  well   suddenly he gets warped back to his spawn point in front of the ruin entrance.

ok.  Still no harm done there.  just stay there little bot, and don't mind me picking off your even smaller minions....  

It all worked well for a while. The big buggar left me alone and I left him alone. 

Now. 

I had rooted him as well, before I calmed him. And when this root timed out he suddenly starts running towards me.  I get no attacked by message, no battle music, no nothing...

But wait!   He does not attack.  He runs to stand by my side as a little slave.   hey, I think to myself.  What a photo oportunity (sp?)

so after my litte photo session I think to my self. why not toss him another calm, just to be sure.    

"NCU error. Target out of range!"

Hmmm  ok I think. this must be a graphical glitch then.  (feature if you will)  so I don't think anymore about it. And I start picking off bucket heads again.  

Alas, my one fatal shot aparantly hit too close to his spawn point and I get attacked by Trash King.

Now here is the kicker; I'm standing outside the ruin well off even visual range off the beast, let alone melee hit distance, but still. (insert Slipknot phrase here: "Here comes the PAIN" .....)

POW POW POW 3 hit's a couple of seconds apart and I get swooshed back to the reclaim terminal.


To quote a very famous man, It's my humble opinion that this sentence fits this story the best. 

Eddie Murphy once said the phrase: " HA HA, Very funny M*therfu*ker!"

now,  I think I'm ready to go again from the rez effects now.

I could'nt be bothered to send them a bug report. let people experience the fun themselves as Microsoft says.


Have fun kids!

Painsmaiden @ 3/13/2002 4:18:57 AM (13973):
I found a Yalm in a chest (finally!) and then later in the same say I found another one! Being the nice guy I am I told my org about my find and had a yalmless guildie run out to the mission.I closed the chest manually.  It took him a good 15 minutes at least to get there. I ran out and duped the key. We ran back inside to the chest. I opened it first to make sure the plane was still there and it was. When he tried to open the chest he got an "already in use" message. So we waited a few seconds and he tried again. He looted the Yalm just fine. Sorry you guys had those problems. Maybe I was lucky.

Isaah @ 3/13/2002 4:55:20 AM (15326):
Yup.

Isaah @ 3/13/2002 5:02:57 AM (15326):
It's also a little sad that we have to know that Funcom would stop this game in a heartbeat for an 'emergency' patch if we were suddenly able to chain cast, insta cast or get our AC and resists unnaturally boosted, however if those same bugs work 'against' us it's just a minor detail that can wait weeks or even a month or two before it takes fixing...

I believe in a sense of fairplay, and an even playing field for all involved, maybe that's just the American in me though... the mentality of a Norwegian might be... if it aint hurtin' us, it aint really hurtin' anybody...

Inocybe @ 3/13/2002 5:21:12 AM (15139):
An annoying bug that should be looked into.

Painsmaiden @ 3/13/2002 5:50:48 AM (10924):
Opi MA, currently 52. Phys Init has been maxed every level and I have implants for it. Maybe I am naive, but I expected that by now I would be SOME effect of pumping up that so far. I have not seen any difference whatever. Even going down to 90% aggro makes for a noticable decrease in attack speed. I think Phys Init is broken and always has been. As soon as the 14.2 patch goes thru (Grr) 'm going to drop all of my skill in Phys Init and see if I slow down at all. If I don't slow down, then it is broken. If I do slow down, then they need to change the skill so it has a bigger effect.

Of course I'm still not sure why I am wasting time writing any of this since I have just read through ever thread on this bug board and haven't seen a single Funcom response. They prob don't even read these.

DaveDread @ 3/13/2002 8:46:59 AM (10924):
I suppose the devs are rather busy with the OE fix respone... over 1000 replies last i checked.

Anyway, the "Flurry" effect has been explained, it's an agg/def bar issue.
And Ninean stated on the test bug forum that MA fists indeed are at phys init and always have been.

*shrug* I dunno, I guess they did some changes to phys init with 13.8/13.9. something happened, not quite sure what thou lol.

Yah, it seems that phys init is acting differently then other inits, it'll be interesting to see future changes and perhaps even explanations.

/DaveDread

Krazakraith @ 3/13/2002 12:05:55 PM (Most annoying, aggravating UNfixed bugs in the game 15554):
For me the most annoying bugs are the chain casting npcs which mainly appear in missions, theres a host of other problems with missions also. And the HUGE memory leak, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE put more attention into this, it makes the game freeze up after 10mins with the graphics turned up all the way, which is why i play with the graphics turned down, which really SUCKS, but even then after an hour or two the game just freezes, usually while trying to zone.

Troyden @ 3/13/2002 3:34:02 PM (Is it a bug? 15588):
I am a level 11 engineer, new to this game so am a little lost.  However I have noticed that my hit points are around 300 and my nano points are just under that.  Can't remember for sure but its close enough.  When I get killed by something I reapear as per usual and wait for my stats to go back to normal and get my belongings from the machine.  I then go to create my advanced automaton and I can't.  Every time I die I loose 50% of my hit points and nano points.  If I log out and back in again they are back.  Is this a bug or am I missing something as a tottaly thick noob??

Onegai @ 3/13/2002 4:13:55 PM (is this pet bug? 15607):
I played an enginner and she's at 25 now....

this has happen for lots of time now but lately itsa getting to be a pain to lost your pet..


Sometimes /pet guard me or /pet follow me would result the pet to ...*run off* somewhere else far from me ...and no its not chasing my next attacker ..its just run away ...i have to chase it and use /pet behind  to actually get it to follow me all the times (in missions using this command would leave the pet in the mission area still while we already zoned out and resulting in pet gone.....)

in mission area playfield, /pet guard me would often get the pet stay at one place and not following us ..even /pet follow would also do the same..though much lesser times.

Are the pathing in missions area or other playfield such as in Oasis known and still in working to be fixed? Ordering pet to attack would someimes make them run away to opposite direction and ...just gone. in Missions sometimes they just stuck at wall even though it was first facing the door and the target is right at the other room in front of the door.....

Please , Please Please let me know this is being fixed! Im tired to get killed due to my pet just wander off trying to attack my attackers (which is sometimes near me and where the pet was first time) but going outside the room or area I'm at with the attacker/s....

Another one is /pet hunt..though its works but i noticed it only hunting for a short period only in which then it wil resume on /pet guard  mode.....is this as what the command designed to do?

Pavaroso @ 3/13/2002 4:37:45 PM (13973):
Was the chest originally locked?  My problem has been that if a chest is locked, then only the person that unlocked it can access it after that point.  In other words, I cannot open the unlocked chest (I get the 'it is locked' message, and I cannot pick the lock (when I try, nothing happens - not even the 'you have failed to pick the lock' type message).

Anybody know if it is supposed to work this way?  We have tried repeatedly, in multiple missions with multiple people trying to access the previously locked chest.

Im doomed, when i open my skills window (u) i can't more read 'em, because i improved with implants and the numbers are green, not the same but green as some skills background, and when the font is mixed with skill background, i simply can't read anymore, i just need to unwear implants to be back to one white font i can read on green backgrounds ... 
Thats very annoying, i'm sure i'm not alone (shut ur f..k up, don't say me to swich contrast or gamma) and it's ridiculous thing to change, only the color of font when buffed or improved by implants,  we now red is "down" skills, white is original skills, damn put one pink, i don't care, but i don't want to see more that green font, whos the Einstein who decided to put green font on green background ?
Please help me, i sent /petition, bugreports@anarchyonline.com, dunno what i can do more ... help me, post on it, show 'em they have to change this little problem, with big boring results.

This week, for the first time, I have been getting hit by dead guys for big damage on RK2, especially on missions.

Is this just a lag issue or was a new bug introduced with the last patch?

Ampris @ 3/13/2002 10:33:38 PM (15238):
When the games frame rate become significantly higher than your monitors refresh rate then problems can occur.

Funcom might want to cap the FPS of the client to max out at the refresh rate the monitor is currently configured for.

RedSonja @ 3/13/2002 11:55:00 PM (Graft armour not spawning in shops 15685):
After spending the past two weeks looking for specific pieces of graft armour from the superior shops it has suddenly dawned on me - it would appear that hardly any pieces are actually spawning in shops.
I'm sure somebody will correct me if I'm wrong.

Only Graft helmets & pants are spawning in shops.
I'm not seeing graft Chest, Sleeves, Gloves or boots in any superior shops - and I've checked a lot of them!

Guido @ 3/14/2002 12:23:42 AM (15685):
Yes, I've been posting about this on several threads and I'm surprised there isn't more of a stink about this.

For example there is no Graft or Organic boots and chests pieces showing up in the superior shops. Every type of armor seems to have one or more parts that never show up and some armors never make an appearance at all.

I have checked both Advanced and Superior shops many, many times over the last week or so (after the last batch of patches) in Tir, Athen, West Athen, Borealis and the guy at the War Academy and they all show this problem.

This showed up after the patch that also made the loot in the chests weird, trimmers, lots of vehicles and maps of Mort and Newland.

Previous to that any piece of any type of armor particular to that shop would spawn over time.

Guido @ 3/14/2002 12:42:19 AM (15653):
That's been an issue from the last batch of patches, it's not as bad as it was though. I found that if you sit right after you get the kill message it SOMETIMES re-synchs everything and the mob dies but sometimes it doesn't, if you're almost dead and can't take another hit this may not help.

I've also found that leaving and coming back to the mission area can SOMETIMES stop this from happening and it also resets casters so they don't chain cast.

RedSonja @ 3/14/2002 12:59:59 AM (15685):
Pleased it isn't just me 
I'm currently doing the run around trying to complete a QL125 set of graft armour, I've managed to get the pants & helmet and it's only just dawned on me that nothing else is spawning LOL

Guido @ 3/14/2002 2:12:31 AM (15685):
Well you know how it is, I figured it was so obvious that this would have been petitioned a million times and FC would have caught it in their logs. 

I don't OE but I do look for armor to the self-buffed max of my str and sta and I can't do missions high enough get semi-decent stuff in them so the shops are the only answer. 

I found the lack when I tried to replace my shop bought Organic with Graft and not all parts ever spawned.

Roop @ 3/14/2002 5:43:13 AM (You have to camp npcs? 15727):
Ridiculous.  Even EverCamp doesn't have you camping NPCs for quests.  So you go talk to this guy, and he has to vanish after you're done.  Why is this exactly?  Problem, there's ten people waiting in line on this guy.  There needs to be more quests, or Funcom needs to leak where the other ones are, because the area is becoming congested with people camping this guy.  It sort of blows whatever suspension of disbelief there would be when you sit around waiting on this npc.  Personally, I'm not going to bother waiting in line for an hour to go up to somebody and tell him I'll kill robots.  Can I buy whatever the reward is from somebody?  Does it ever get fun, or will I get to the next stage, and find people waiting in line there, too?

Arinia @ 3/14/2002 9:36:40 AM (13590):
Cosmik, Cz, anyone from FC, can we get an update on this?  I haven't seen a post (I used search  ) on it since this one.

When it is going to get fixed?  Or will it get swept under the carpet like so many other nerfs?  At least tell us WHY it was nerfed; doesn't seem right, as the nano does not do what the description says.

Currently rage is a under 30 second init and runbuff.  That is unacceptable.

Nanogater @ 3/14/2002 9:59:01 AM (HE fix ? 15738):
Why can't you fix HE plz ?

It has been broken for ages now, but still no word on when u will fix it 

Yes, it does p*** me off that u don't care 'bout this bug. Or show no sign of caring. Especially since HE is one of NT's last remaining reasons for being wanted in teams. Fix it damn it, it can't be that hard to match effect time to stated buff time ?

Gvain @ 3/14/2002 5:37:20 PM (15685):
This is also the case for Steel Ribbed armor.  The Advanced stores don't have anything beyond Boots or Gloves, and the Superior stores seem to only have Nadir Leggings, Gloves, regular Boots and Helms.  It has been at least a week, probably more since I have even seen a Chest or Sleeves in the stores.  My AC is really starting to suffer <thankfully an awesome fixer hooked me up with a ICC cloak>.  My AC's are now just under 1200 at lvl 59 and I'm starting to get worried with the cloak.

Gvain @ 3/14/2002 5:39:12 PM (14677):

Federot @ 3/14/2002 9:37:01 PM (15588):
It is a bug, but there is a quick workaround.

Just open your skills list and hit Accept.  Your HP and Nano points will instantly be readjusted to where they should be.

I'll bump this.  I like the suggestion of being teleported to the first room too.  

And kudos for most on keeping this thread civil and being constructive.  

To Cosmik or whoever, please take the time to read through this thread and compile the constructive alternatives that some users have suggested to the mission reset problem.  I know it was 'designed' as it is now, but there are problems with that design and alternatives should at least be considered.

Note that this isn't a call for an 'official response' as I realize that puts you in an ackward situation.  Just please read it, compile the list, and pass on our concerns to the devs if you haven't already.  Thank you.

*EDITED*
In hopes of getting this addressed, I've gone through and compiled it for you:  

Ming: Suggests destroying the mission completely, leaving you outside.

Dareus: Suggests reinit and leaving you in the first room.

Others: ~23 total also bumping this message.  Multiply that by however whatever the silent/vocal ratio you think exists on this board.

This is a problem since 13.8 (happens to me all the time now -- especially after recieving mission item).  It has been reported several times on this forum, but hasn't been fixed.  Search for 'syrup movement' as an alternate name for the problem.

Strycker @ 3/15/2002 5:35:38 AM (Subway mission debris pile bug 15861):
I did a retrieve-item mission today that turned out to be
a small subway level -- only 5 rooms. No objective item
was evident on the level. I strongly suspect it was buried
completely beneath a pile of debris in one of the rooms. 

In other words I think that the room designer specified
a chest/objective location point on his floor level Z
coordinate, but forgot that the small cube items would
disappear beneath the mound. If the designer tested
the room with a chest, the chest would certainly have
protruded from the pile in a reasonably nice looking way,
since chests are much larger than cube-items.

Anyway, I can't be sure about this as the cause of the
bug, but this is the first time in a long time that I've
been unable to find a retrieve-item object and I scoured
the 5 rooms for a good long time, too.

Oh yeah, it was a retrieve-item mission for a gun of some
kind, I forget which, so I didn't overlook a "weird-looking
bomb" or something like that. The mission objective could
only have been a small cube or one of those weird
gray-rectangle-with-handle thingies.

Ashuras @ 3/15/2002 7:44:42 AM (15861):
I've encountered one such mission where I could not find the objective too. 

Later there is another similar one where I could not find the objective again. This time, I asked a guild mate to help search the place.

He subsequently found it behind some boxes. Really strange.

So I'm not so sure whether during the 1st case.... was it becoz we overlooked some obscure corners...

Kzak @ 3/15/2002 12:20:12 PM (Item disappearing bug when shopping and cancelling trade 15887):
If you are engaged in shopping with someone (be it a vending machine or NPC) and sell items - putting more items into the 'Sell' windows than you have free inventory slots yourself, and then cancel the trade.. guess what? Your inventory only receives the items it can fit, the rest are lost. No 'Overflow' window appearing either. I only lost some non-vital items, but other players might well lose valuable items this way. Something to be fixed over the course of time.

Kzak @ 3/15/2002 12:22:22 PM (Minor bug when uploading nanoformulas 15888):
If you try uploading a nanoformula already in your repertoire, you get an error-message that you already know this formula - and the nanocrystal disappears, to boot.

Ladeda @ 3/15/2002 12:30:57 PM (Another day - Another Crash - Another Character Raped!! 15891):
Don't ya just love the way FunCom congratulates themselves on how stable this game is??    Or how about all the "improvements" they've made to stablity?  Makes me wonder which game their playing!!  Certainly NOT Anarchy Online!

From the very start I've had a reoccuring Problem.  I'm standing next to the bank going through my bags, for whatever reason.  And the game crashes, or the zone crashes.  And when I get back in the bags I had pulled out aren't in my inventory any more and they aren't in the bank.  It happened again tonight!

Of course my Problem is that this represents a "financial loss" to that character.  Items saved up and not sold just go POOF!!  And we all (should) know that FunCom doesn't, won't, "refuses" to do anything about it!  I'd suggest they "find a way" to compensate characters who have this happen.  Instead of telling their "customers" to just "piss off".    This is not an "Act of God" it is poor programming and bad server management.  They should act responsibly.  Maybe, eventually, enough of you will get completely tired of this (like I am) and we can figure out a way to "force" the Issue.  But some of you LAMERS will obviously never care.  So the probability is very slim.

BTW this isn't the only Problem AO has.  It's just one that keeps coming back, over and over ....   And I'm just trying to vent some of my frustration instead of just cancelling my account.  But here's my best attempt at a "constructive suggestion" -> 

Make Vehicles sellable to the shops.   All of my characters (with one very young exception) have multiple vehicles which I've picked up in missions.  I know I'm not the only one either.  Another Guilde has at least 7 Mids at last count.  So most of these simply "Pile UP" in the bank.  I mean face it. Once you have a Yalmaha you don't have any use for the others.  FunCom doesnt' have to make them "Tradeable" per se.  Just let us sell them to the proper shop terminal.

Another suggestion might be to "give us more loot" from missions at least.  It's not easy to make it financially in this game.  And I know that many of you "buy your credits" because of this fact.  Everything is simply "too expensive" - Implants, Armor...   And the vast majority of the missions I take provide a lot of XP and very little loot.  I can spend 2 hours plus on a single mission and leave without filling 1 bag.  And this says nothing of the "quality" of the loot either.  I've actually had missions that gave me Numerous Maps (to both Newland and Mort) - as in 26 maps from 1 single mission.  Now what the "F" is up with that?  That's "stupid" in my book.  Or what about all those "locked chests" that are empty???  I mean why are they even locked if they have nothing in them?  Really it's so "bad" most of the time I can't "afford" to have my characters level up!  Because if I do then I can't afford to buy new Implants let alone new armor, weapons, nanos, etc...  So IMO something has got to change.... "yesterday"!

Bierbauch @ 3/15/2002 1:03:32 PM (15887):
Open the same shop again, the items should be still inside.

Kzak @ 3/15/2002 1:07:30 PM (15887):
Ah, I didn't think of that.. will try this evening to see what happens. Regardless, an Overflow window would point out to the user clearly that the inventory is full, and items might be lost if he zones.

Darkblood @ 3/15/2002 1:43:26 PM (No more patience. 15895):
It is with GREAT pleasure I cancel BOTH my accounts.

I am sick to death of stupid ass bugs wasting my real life time investment in TRYing to play this game.

I don't hold the ARKs responsible for not being able to reimburse lost XP (now in the millions) all due to bugs.

My most recent one was losing 300k to a zonbie. Yes a zonmbie...standing there no name/health bar above it's head while it hit me for 120 a hit. me out of nano for heals, but it was able to take 1k+ of my health with NO fear of me hitting it. BECAUSE IT WAS DEAD!

Isembard @ 3/15/2002 1:51:45 PM (Mission Loot 'bug' 15896):
This one was widely reported on the 13.8 patch forum - but never got a definitive reply (or I missed it).

With 13.8 the in-mission chest loot changed. Short term this is not a problem - the bucket loads of trimmers sell for reasonable cash and most players don't seem to object to finding more Yalms .

Long term though the changed mission loot distribution will affect the in-game economy quite radically - some effects are starting to make themselves felt already (less armour and nano's for sale).

So my questions are these:-

Is this change permament, indeed, is it a change or a bug?

If it is a bug, is it likely to get fixed 'soon'?

viz0id @ 3/15/2002 2:47:11 PM (Biggest Bug Ever! 15901):
I must have the biggest bug, EVER!... I have shops that other don't have.  And i don't have all the other shops that they have. I have items places that other don't have, like a table or a chair in the middle of the shop. (btw, this doesn't happen one or two times, it happens everytime i log on). I also can't use the surgery-mashine... i see weapons that others have like bricks (some of them) i get bluescreens often and this bothers me alot... i wonder if it has something with me using winME...
plz... if somebody have the same as me.. contact me!

Actually, the description for rage nanos states that they attempt to remove "combat debuffs" not "hostile nano programs".

It is the Doctor Epsilon Purge nano that says it "Attempts to remove all harmful nano formulas from the target."

But what bugs more then no weapon is getting stuck in missions because you can't fit through a door...now THAT is a battlesuit bug they should fix.

Psilex @ 3/15/2002 5:01:24 PM (15891):
I'm not gonna stand up for Funcom on this one, but I don't agree, mostly.

1.  If funcom compensated people in any way, I believe there are enough dishonest people out there that it would actually screw with the economy.  I always try to work around the bugs when I encounter them....if you crash alot when at the bank, hurry up your transactions so you don't spend too much time there.  Grab all the bags you think the item might be in etc....until they fix it.

2.  Use Yalmbot...it works

3.  RIGHT ON BROTHER!  I think there is way too little variation in chest loot, and now WAY too many are locked.

Psilex @ 3/15/2002 5:04:34 PM (15588):
thanks for the work-around

Psilex @ 3/15/2002 5:07:26 PM (15653):

I am paying much more attention to ping rate now.

Arinia @ 3/15/2002 6:12:33 PM (13590):
Accelerates the body's metabolism to such a rate that the Enforcer actually ignites. This briefly increases movement speed and initiatives. The Enforcer continuously takes damage while this nano lasts, but so do all enemies that hit the Enforcer during this period. The nanobots also attempt to remove combat debuffs currently on the Enforcer and give a Nano AC boost while they are operational.
			
		
	
It all depends on what your (ok I guess funcom's) definition of "Combat Debuffs" is.  Right now it's NOTHING, because it doesn't work at all.

At any rate, here's my daily BUMP.  Can we get a response as to when this is going to be fixed?  It's a HUGE issue.  I'm already slow as hell and being rooted makes it even worse.

Arinia @ 3/15/2002 6:14:12 PM (15891):
How does Yalmbot work if the loot expires in 10-15 minutes?  Do you need to keep the chest open or something?

If so they should specify that in the help message.  When I checked it last week to see what it was all about, I noticed that it didn't mention anything about that.

JFlack @ 3/15/2002 9:27:07 PM (Nano Resist Skill won't save after 'Update' 15960):
No matter how much I up my Nano Resist skill, the changes are never saved after I hit the 'Update' button.  (eg. 119 -> 135, hit update, check again = back to 119)  

I can up several other skills at the same time as Nano Resist and they all get saved, but Nano Resist is always set back to the starting point.

I noticed this problem when I first created my char (about 2 months ago), then it worked correctly for awhile, now its broken again.  (since 13.8?)

Anybody else having this problem?

Ladeda @ 3/15/2002 11:38:46 PM (15891):
Psilex you don't understand.  I don't crash allot.  But both of us should realize that the zones in AO DO crash fairly regularly.  I can't predict it!  (well sometimes I can)  And it doesn't matter how much time I've spent at the bank.  There have been times I've run to the Bank, pulled out some bags to go sell some stuff and before I could get to the shop I was headed for WHAMO!! the zone goes down and the bags I pulled are lost!!! 

And I don't have any intention of using Yalmbot.  I do allot of missions.  Most of my Characters have Yalms... plus Mids, Kodiaks, Watercraft.  I might be inclined to keep a watercraft (read 1) for the Engie and Adventurer.  But all the rest are just a waste.  With the exception of my lvl 3 Crat - all of my characters have at least 3 vehicles that will never be used.  So I want to get something out of them!

Along the same lines I feel that Bracers should be tradable.  They aren't any different IMO from Rings or shoulder pads.  So why can't they be traded??

Fishtaco @ 3/16/2002 12:40:03 AM (14710):
If the mission crashes/resets just place all members in the startup room, that way even if they where forced to Start over in the mission i.e. re kill all the mobs it would be whole lot better than being DEAD  and thats what this thread is about in the first place.

Damnit I wrote a longish post.

In short.

Actually, the description for rage nanos states that they attempt to remove "combat debuffs" not "hostile nano programs".


Combat debuffs are Hostile nano "debuffs"  since they are to , make the person lose skills in something, debuff, bad = hostile.

:P

Zaal @ 3/16/2002 5:13:22 PM (14710):
Yeah cause it happened to me again last night - camping Neleb with my pet - one that I cant cast by myself and I need a trader or MP to cast (yes - its an acceptable OE pet =P) - and the mission just resets.  Drops us all out to the desktop.  Course, If I, the pet class can make it back in fast enough my pet will still be there and I'll have no worries.  

OF COURSE I FAIL TO REALIZE THAT THIS IS A SERVER RESET AND THAT I'M ABOUT TO GET $&*($#$ UP THE #$%!  

Whenever a server resets the missions anyone is in it causes several problems, not the least of which is a chaotic dispersal of the team.  It is generally unknown how long its going to take a team to reorganize even if they are in a "safe" place.  In a persistent game world the mobs would respawn at their natural rate and that would be fine -  we worked our way up and killed what we needed to kill to get there.  

WHEN A MISSION RESETS IT KILLS EVERYONE - DESTROYING THE CONSISTENCY OF THE GAME - "EATING" PET CLASSES (ENGIES, CRATS, MPS) PETS, WHICH ARE IN MOST PET CLASSES CASES, THEIR ONLY REAL DEFENSE AGAINST MONSTERS AND NPCS IN ANARCHYONLINE.

This is my ***** now.  My NT retired due to the fact that no one wants to team with him cause he's a gimp, I now play an engineer, and I generally pay some other classes to buff me up, cause at level 100 or so with only ql 125 implants in my self cast pet sucks.  Its my level and not good.  So mission resets eat my cash flow as well, the next time getting online I have to pay for more buffs and then proceed to HOPE that I won't lose the pet that cost me credits in some random server reset.  But there are no guarantees in Funcom land.  

MY FIX SUGGESTION IS NOW TO LINK ALL PETS TO THEIR CREATORS AND STORE THEM WITH THEM INDEFINITELY EVEN AFTER A PET CLASS LOGS OFF OR AS PER THEIR TIME LIMIT MIGHT SUGGEST (crat - mp pets have timelimits).

This is a result of thought, why do we have to create our pets every time anyway.  Link them to us so that when we log off, that the pets go into the stasis world with us as well.  That way when we come back the pet is still there, if a mission resets I will personally have a better chance of surviving if I have my pet (not great but better than nothing).  I sometimes only have limited time to play too - so me getting buffed up to get a pet running that I'm just going to log and kill in two hours seems harsh and a waste of credits.  I try to keep my paid buff pets by going /afk a LOT.  Hmmmmm.  

MISSION RESETS WILL CAUSE ANOTHER MASS EXODUS OF PEOPLE FROM ANARCHY ONLINE.

People come here to enjoy themselves and lose themselves in an alternate online reality.  Not to get killed by a technical glitch in the server that forces an instadeath on everyone in a mission area.  Keep it up and this is gonna be another "12.6".

THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE YET TO SEE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM FUNCOM ON.

A GM refused to transport a character of mine out of a mission becuase he said it woudl "interfere with gameworld consistency"...  to this I say "?????" !  The gameworld consistency was already shot to hell when the mission reset, respawned all the dead mobs, ate my expensive pet, killing my team link, and causing me to log in blind to a hostile zone.  If the mission state could be maintained and the mobs still be dead then fine - I could MAYBE deal with losing my pet - at least with all the mobs dead still that we spent HOURS killing I would have a clear path out of the mission.  

Ya know the funny part.  The GM said soemthign about re-looting all the mobs that made me think their bigger concern was the fact that we were looting them for the crappy items they drop and ont credits.  He sounded very sure in his world of "You should die because you're going to get to loot them all again."  GM Be****, you know who you are.  

FIX IT - I KNOW IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO IS CANCELLING BECAUSE OF THIS.

I hate you Funcom; you make a game I have no choice but to LOVE and you let things in it happen that make me HATE that I love the game.  Please start doing things right.

I tried to put it on my back, but could not.

What am I missing, what does it matter if I cannot put it on my back? It grants nothing. Maybe it needs to be on your back to expand the amount of weight you can carry but I have a level 88 who has never worn a backpack, just kept them in the inventory. Never had any problem with too much weight.

T.I.M. resists *every* nano I cast 100% of the time, until T.I.M. heals back above ~50%, at which point it stops resisting and nanos work normally.  Fumbles also increase dramatically, from 0 fumbles when T.I.M. is above 50% health to about 1 in 5 when T.I.M. is below 50% health.

Expected Result:
Grey mobs should almost never resist any nano I cast; they certainly should not resist 100% of the time *ever*.

Additional information:
When T.I.M. is above ~50% health, it is like all grey mobs, in that it almost never resists any nano I cast (including Volcanic Eruption (130 Nano Resist)).

Nanos that I tried on T.I.M. which it resisted below 50% health include Discourage Involvement, Project Calm, Ball and Chain, Igzimmers Enveloping Flame, and Annihalating Hadron String.  These range from 85 Nano Resist to 120 Nano Resist.

I tried hitting the mob, using special attacks, moving around, jumping, etc. to change this "uber resistance".  Nothing made a difference until the mob had healed itself past ~50% health at which point my nanos worked again.

I have fought and killed T.I.M. in the past in a team of 2 people (me and a lvl 80 Crat), and did not start seeing 100% resists below 50%.

I'm guessing that something triggers the mob's nanoresist to increase by many times when damaged below 50%, which is why I'm seeing 100% resist and fumbles.  This does not occur on yellow or greater mobs.  [Maybe mobs that con lower than you (or your team) go full defensive after getting below 50% health and there's a bug where full defense results in a nano resist many times higher than it should be.]

hobbes @ 3/16/2002 8:43:45 PM (16043):
What is the difference? 

Why would I spend 70 more in adventuring to put his thing on my back. This backpack gives nothing but frees up 1 space. There are other backpacks which give skills, so I see the difference there. 

I expected the same rules to apply to backpacks, as to armour. Why would I need x strength and y stamina to wear pants? I can't figure out the mechanism? It is a game element, we all accept it. That is why we are all not wearing the highest level armour we can buy, we have to invest the appropriate IP.

Why would anyone ever buy a generic medium or small backpack, except the money issue. I only started looking at backpacks when my missions started to be outside of cities and I could not sell my items between them. Money was not an issue by then.

So, maybe they should remove adv. requirements on generic backpacks. Not a majot issue, but had I realized I could use the large for storage purposes, I would not have put any IP into adventuring.

Valen @ 3/16/2002 11:21:00 PM (Biomech first-aid and treatment stat boosts do not work. 16074):
I've been reporting this since probably September, but I haven't in awhile, so thought I would again to make sure it gets on Funcom's list (I've never seen mention that Funcom has identified it as a bug).

Biomech armor has stat boosts for first-aid and treatment.  These stat boosts work when you first put on the armor, but as soon as you zone, they are lost.  To complicate matters, when you take the armor back off, the code checks the boost amount, and deducts that from your current first-aid and treatment skills, which now that the boosts were lost, end up going negative to your base skill.

I ran a test today to confirm that this is an actual functionality bug, not just a visual display bug.  I took off all of my biomech armor, and attempted to use a QL 90 nano-recharger, which my base treatment skill (without biomech boosts) is above, and was denied because of the amount that treatment was reduced by from the removal of my biomech armor.  I zoned, and was then allowed to use my nano-chargers (after the first-aid and treatment skills reset from zoning).

I then put my biomech armor all back on, so that my first-aid and treatment were boosted by the armor stats.  I used a QL 80 speed stim with a requirement of 387 first-aid... I had 388 with the biomech first-aid boosts.  The stim worked successfully.  I then zoned, looked at my stats (first-aid went back down to 357), and tried another QL 80 speed stim, and was denied saying that I needed 387 skill in first-aid.  The screenshot of the text from my stim experiment can be found here.

I'd at least like to get confirmation from Funcom that they have identified this bug, so that it can eventually make it on the todo list.  This bug has existed since at least September (when I could first start wearing biomech), if not since day one, and I have yet to see any mention about it from Funcom.

Skob @ 3/17/2002 1:15:18 AM (15896):
I noticed on agentsector.com the other day that one of the developers had finally admitted that the loot tables were screwed up.  He pretty much said they didn't know why yet, but it was a high priority type thing and they may or may not get a fix in as part of the 14.0 patch.

It's too bad that 'high priority' for Funcom seems to be code for completely ignoring a problem and failing to acknowledge that it even exists for weeks or months at a time - so who knows when this will be fixed.  At least they finally admitted it was a bug.

Read the description at the bottom of the info window for Da Taunter, I think it's supposed to work that way. BTW the "healing" amount gets bigger than the "damage" and more often the higher the QL of the Da Taunter.

Ok, the description says it was invented by a Doctor that was tired of getting beat on, maybe he didn't get it quite right and sometimes the darn thing just heals.

I have dismissed this odd notion of mine until now (when the game crashed because of a bug and I died so I have nothing better to do than report all the bugs I can think of ), but it seems to me that nukes, on a rare occasion, can actually heal NPC's. As soon as the text box lists "monster attacked by nanobots for so and so damage", the bar of the monster i've seen happen numerous times with both my MP and Crat througout the levels, can jump up just a bit, seemingly by the amount it was listed to damage them for. Now, could it just be me imagining things, that maybe the NPC is programmed to use a first-aid kit or something after enough damage? Has anyone noticed anything odd like this?

Sometimes after a LD or getting out a mission, I loose control of my pet. This has been reported many times : the pet is here, following you around but doing nothing and not reporting.

You can then just cast a new pet and charm the lobotomized one to do your bidding.

I consider it's not an exploit since Crats are supposed to have a pet and charm 1-2 more, but still the loosing control part is always annoying.

I.E when you get out of range and come back to your team they all show with their UNBUFFED hp. This is so g.d annoying and sometimes makes it hard to know who to heal in a group or even when to heal!! 
Your whole team looks half dead if you get out of range and back.. until you target them that is.. VERY ANNOYING.

Same goes for damage. You cant really see whos taking damage before they are down to their BASE unbuffed hp.
This goes for PVP aswell. Your target is at full HP until you get it down to base HP..

Every 30-45 minutes, get your ENTIRE team out of the mission.  Wait a minute or two before going back in.  You'll lose your map, of course, but that's better than the alternative.  

I haven't had a crash/reset for two weeks while doing this.  However, I do know of people who've had a crash/reset within 10 minutes of entering the mission so this is not a cure-all.

It must be the wings stacking and still taking up space after i zone, but not being able to use it, the problem goes away after 30 mins which is when the wings nano stops. So i think your problem could be caused by the same problems.... needless to say this is a very annoying bug

Yeah I finally got a response from Geoff Higgins.  All he could do was sympathize with my "loss".  But at least he did agree with me that mission loot "sucks".  But I'm still stuck trying to overcome FunCom's latest "****".  

It really bothers me that I can do a mission that takes 2 hours +  and not come out with 1 bag full of loot!  It's so bad that I'm just about to quit.  Then the same thing happens to one of my Guidmates.... And she lost stuff the Guild just doesn't have in quantity (Nano Armor).  One of the questions she asked me was "how I recovered??"  All I could tell her was that I pulled stuff from other characters, which didn't help her at all because this is her first and only character.

I didn't stay on long enough to find out if they helped her.  But I'll bet that if it ever happens again she'll just quit.  Which is definately what I would do - if I hadn't already paid for a 6-month subscription recently.    FunCom just will not learn.

So someone actually admitted that the "loot tables" were screwed!?!   Well when I complained bitterly to an ARK last night - in my daily "Rant Petition".  He told me they were working on this for the next patch.  

The problem is that I don't want to wait for the Next patch.  Either I get almost nothing.  Or I wind up with a pack full of Maps.  (In one mission alone I picked up 28 total maps to Mort and Newland.)  Oh the other thing I get is lots and lots of "furniture".

i love when this bug hits and your fighting vets or mobs that hit for a nice amount of damage. its been happening on my 98 MA for a while now. "starting attack failed" starts spamming my screen then i get hit 1-5 times or so. The funniest part about this bug, even if you didnt have aggro (like if your in a team) this bug can still hit you. I've even see it hit more then 1 person at 1 time.

MuscularBeaver @ 3/19/2002 10:30:49 AM (Massive fight synchronization problem 16381):
This is a major variation on the problem where you get hit by a dead MOB.   

Until now, I only got hit once or twice at most by dead MOBs.  But last night I got WAY "out of sync".  Every time I attacked a new MOB, a long string of messages appeared all at once as if I hit the MOB 10-15 times in less than a second.  The MOB's HP bar goes way down immediately.   

At first that looks like a very cool bug, since the MOB gets a LOT of damage without the chance to hit back.  But after the MOB is finally dead, it keeps hitting me over and over again (delayed reaction due to being out of sync).   
Naturally, I can't hit back, since it's already "dead".  Fortunately, my first aid kit works in real time, so I can usually stay alive until the fight is officially over.  

I managed to sync back up after about 5 fights, but I don't know what I did that made it happen.

I have no weapons on, so it's making me hit the mob with my fists which does about 2 damage.

Ghidora @ 3/19/2002 1:40:23 PM (15607):
I have a 155 MP and this is a big problem that I have been seeing with my pets.  I think I have found the root cause of the problem - locked doors.  When the pets seem to run off by it-self I almost always find it trying to run though a locked door.  I think the pet pathing (which was suppose to be improved) needs adjustment. When I do missions I ALWAYS walk with the pets behind, but no matter what the pets sooner or later gets lost or takes off.

Imagine this happy scenario, you enter a long room with your pet behind you (in the same room as you) an ACE sees you and attacks - you issue an attack command, but instead of attacking the pet runs out of the room and goes 3 or 4 rooms away. If I live I will usually find him trying to run into a locked doorway.

Come on Funcom fix this!  Or at least make it so we can terminate our (MP) pets from any distance.

If you team you don't get that many tokens now either so for people that like to team it will take long time for the 1k board

Last night, my long and hard work at missions paid off and I finally got myself the twin sun 1000 token merit board. I don't know anyone else on RK2 who has one; maybe I'm the first 

w00t!

'Course, I wanted to show it off by clicking it and having the merit appear floating over my shoulders while walking the streets of Tir. When I click it to display, though, it just unequips to my inventory instead. I can only show people that I have it by dropping it into chat.

This is not a gamestopping issue, and it's certainly doesn't affect that many different characters, but what a damn letdown.

I notice this occurs most often when I am rooting.  Both chain rooting for the root n shoot and also rooting and then backing off to heal.  Most commonly when I root and move out of range of the mob to heal.  You are lucky that you can survive.  I generally find it deadly if I can't make it to the exit.

Semuta @ 3/19/2002 9:19:05 PM (Swimsuit display problems (warning -- partial nudity involved!) 16453):
If you generate a female Solitus character, tall, with medium build, and put one of the cheap swimsuits on her (the light blue one, costs 1500 or 2500, goes in the back slot, has criss-cross-style straps, is NOT one of the metal suits), the bottom part is actually hidden from view inside the character model, so it doesn't actually appear.

Point is, when you put one of these on, it makes your character look like they are wandering around without any sort of covering for the pubic area. Not very ladylike. :P

I have no idea whether the tall/medium build female solitus character model has display issues with any of the other swimsuits. I just bought a set of implants (the skill enhancing kind, not the bust-enhancing kind), so I'm short of cash at the moment to be spending it on social clothing.

Heheh, Most tokens I managed to get in 1 day is 130 I think, I did small caves in north BS for 15 hours, so going from 400-1k in 3 days are extremly hard and you have to be really lucky, the reason it take so long time is:

1) Getting those missions take pretty long time, often 30+ min to get 3 missions

2) 1/5 or something are to small to get token (less than 4 mobs usually don't give you a token)

3) 1/3 or something are "subway stations" so not small missions

So often MAX 1/3 are small caves(and just because it's the grey/white cave layout doesn't mean it have to be really small caves, sometimes they are huge), often less, so with all this you get max 2 missions done per hour, so 14 tokens, that's a very good hour.

A little tip is to do 40% missions in BS and only do those that DON'T have the small table/desk at left side in first room, those with something else there are often pretty small but also often enought mob so even if some are grey you can get token.

I finally got my 1k token board earlier today and I have been soloing missions since the "token patch" but I usually only got like 30 tokens every day cuz I sat down and chatted too much..

Graxxus @ 3/20/2002 2:01:21 AM (15140):
I have the losing macro problem occasionally but what is more prominent to me lately is the slow emptying of nanos from my favorites list.  Being an agent I have to be selective of the types of nanos I install mainly due to organizational problems inherent to the current system.  I used to use the favorites tab in conjunction with the shortcut menu but now I seemed to have reach a maximum number of nanos that I can keep in the favorites tab.  If I put more nanos in that field it stays for a while and then slowly they transfer over back to PSI or whatever nano type they are.  On one of my characters all of the nanos in favorites have dissappeared from that tab and are now found again in their  nano type fields.

I have a realy big problem with lag when opening a door inside a mission. I have goten my team slaughtered several times due to the lockup I get sometimes when a door slides open. What happens is I will be pulling, when I aproach a door it opens and i freeze, I cant move my cursor, cant do anything. Then after 4-5 secconds i am at 10% health and my team is dragging themselvs towards the exit on the brink of death. This sucks, wouldnt mind it so bad if it was just killing me, but its killing my team also. It makes me wana crawl into a hole and never come out. I hate that this happens, it makes me reluctant to join a team. Anyone else have or noticed this problem? Is there something I can do to solve the problem on my end.  Thanks

Change your mission sliders.  The Open-Hidden slider is the documented "get more locked chests" slider.  Move it all the way to open.  I think it's bugged a little because even if I have it just a bit away from full Open, say 10%, I still get over 1/2 locked chests.  But if I have it 100% Open, then I get very few.

Its a bug, not much you can really do accept deal with it until it is fixed

During that time when the mobs is still attacking you and your standing there, you are actually attacking (or at least the game thinks you are). You'll notice that your ammo wil go down, or if you are attacking a mobs with a damage shield that you'll still get hit by the shield.    When you goto attack the new mob, your computer decides to catch up and fire those shots for real.
 Personally I like that bug.  (so take your time FC fixing it) I'll attack the greener mobs first and if i notice they arn't dying i'll attack an orage/red next...  Hit fling and 5 regular shot instantly come out, add a burst and my next regular shot and you have one dead mob.

Seriously, though, if you want to get this bug fixed within the next month, we all have to say this:

That might make them fix it.

sbermunk @ 3/21/2002 3:51:22 AM (16500):
My theory with the "mission-door lag" is that it is related to loading of texture-maps. I have a pretty good system (AMD XP1600, 512M DDR, GF3Ti200), but I was having the same problem. After turning off texture compression and changing to 32-bit color mode instead of 16-bit color mode, the lag was much reduced, even though I am still using high-res textures. (My theory being that the texture-maps are in 32-bit color, and uncompressed by default - using 16-bit and compression causes the engine to convert and recompress the textures all the time, I believe.) Of course the client then sucks up WAY more ram... but luckily 512M is enough. I'm still fiddling with the graphics settings to try and reduce the "MDL" effect even further, but at this point I have it down to a controllable level...
The client seems to need a lot of redesign when it comes to the texture-handling... Dynamic loading of new textures shouldn't cause the entire client to come to a standstill while the texture is loaded from disk, for instance...

Tasslehoff @ 3/21/2002 5:02:52 AM (MoB's back from the dead... MADNESS!!! 16674):
Today, while spawn camping just outside of Tir, I had a new experience.

I found a nice red Bio X49 or whatever for my pet to go and slaughter.  My pet screamed BLOOD!!!! and proceeded to kick the Bio's arse.  When it was all said and done, I recieved the loot message, got the XP and went over to loot it.  It was still standing, and to be honest it didn't like me trying to rifle through his pockets.  This wasn't the only thing to surprise me though.  

It chased me, and it hit me and hit me and hit me!!!

I tried to fight back, but got the message "It's already dead!" 

That's not even the surprising part - this happens all too often with pets.  

The surprising part is that after a minute or two, while running and trying to heal from a fight with a dead guy, I was able to attack him again as though he were alive.  It took another three hits for it to finally go down since it was healing it's dead self all the while chasing me.  

Now I understand latency and synch problems to a point, but when dead guys get up, hack away at you and don't allow you to descrate there corpses, then they revive themselves and try to kill you again, I have to draw the line!  

Please fix this!  I'd be embarrassed if a corpse killed me!

Being fairly new to the game, I'm not sure if this has been mentioned as a solution or not, but it cant hurt to say something... can it?

When I first installed, I set the graphics options to use w buffering [because of the comment that you get better graphics]. Over the course of the next two days [play sessions] I crashed three or four times. After setting this checkbox to off, I haven't had a single crash in eight days of play [including 16 hrs on the weekend].

Koromir, that would be a client crash.  You would still be logged in when you came back.  A server crash/reset means you are no longer logged in even though you wouldn't have had time to timeout your connection yet.

A client crash would not produce the mission reset, only a mission server crash/reset would repopulate a mission.

After wasting 24k+ on three large backpacks, I discovered that I was dumb for
having done so.  Small backpacks cost one tenth the price but hold exactly
the same number of items.  The only difference between large and small, aside
from the graphic, is that large has a higher weight limit.  Weight limits are not
implemented.  Thus, there is no advantage at all to the buyer to purchase the
vastly more expensive large packs.

* They fix this zombie ****. Being hit for 120+ a hit by a target that is *already dead* (<-- message when you retarget and hit *q*)

* fix the stupid right click DEfunctionality. Thank fcuk I don't rely on health stims anymore. During a fight, and subsequently thereafter,  you cannot use anything requiring a right click action. Only fix that works apart from zoning is to target a door, target self, buff self (heal doesn't seem to work).

* Seems the activation of brawl is screwy again. Thx reintroduce OLD bugs!

* .....they seemed to have fixed the MOBs getting 10 attacks to yoru 1 problem.

..can't remember the rest but these don't even delve into the PVP, class balancing issues these are BASIC GAMEPLAY BUGS!

Guest @ 3/22/2002 5:51:00 AM (Can't ID anything in Shops! Plus another type of Crash.. 16832):
I have been away from AO since august, i have been in the beta 2 period and played for a couple months after this thing went commercial.  I have a good idea or at least did of how things work. Which i just started to play again this month.. anyway..

My main problem is when i'm in shops i'm not able to right click and bring up the menu of things to do with the items in the shops.  Which i'm not able to ID the items.. was this intentional? Or is it a game-play bug?

Also when i quit the game and then try and restart the game, it will cause my system to lockup, in other words crash... and i have to hit the ol' reset button, or turn my power off and back on again.  This is not good for my system.. so i'm definately not playing again unless these issues are fixed.

I'm currently running with:
Intel Motherboard and Chipset 
Windows Xp
PIII 1 Ghz
Geforce 3 Ti 500 64 mb (ver. 21.81a)
512 megs ram
Sound Blaster Audigy
Cable modem rated at 500 kb/Road Runner ISP

Currently have all hardware updated including Windows Xp.

If anyone can help, would be greatly appreciated.

MuscularBeaver @ 3/22/2002 6:21:14 AM (Crash workaround: Improve Server automated gameplay? 16837):
If the server is going to play my character to fight MOBs for me after a crash, I'd really appreciate it if you'd improve the server code to do a better job.  I'm getting really tired of the game crashing in the middle of a fight within a mission, only to find my character standing in front of a reclaim station when it finally lets me log back in.  

Can you have the server email me the results of the fight while I'm waiting to get back in?  That would cut down on the suspense a little.  On second thought, the outcome is always the same, so don't bother. 

By the way, aren't patches supposed to make a game MORE STABLE?

Amador @ 3/22/2002 6:55:00 AM (Viper Staff bug 16839):

When you are wielding the Viper Staff (MP 2hb summoned weapon) and the duration expires, the staff still appears to be in your hand (even though it's gone). If you go into attack mode, you will do the "martial arts" thing, where you have no weapon wielded.

RandaZ @ 3/22/2002 12:03:58 PM (Outdoor/Indoor Server Synching with Suggestion 16868):
This is a suggestion for Funcom's live code team.  Pass this on if you will Cz or Cosmik.

I've noticed a lot more problems in indoor missions lately.   Invisible mobs and mirror walls to name a few.  This is probably due to a more unstable network connection recently.  However, some changes to the client/server code might mitigate the problem.

First off, let's take a look at outdoor synching as a baseline (which is still working robust enough as is).  The dead reckoning currently used is working well the majority of the time.  However, when the client and server desynch, you generally have let the client win.  That is, unless the client somehow crossed outside the 9 active 40m squares.  In that case, the server wins (has to) and pulls the client back.  That's a good design, and given the 120m width of our active region, warping is kept to a minimum.  Someone's gotta be awful lagged or the network congested pretty badly for the client to traverse even half that distance.

Now, the problem is that with indoor missions, the active region is far less than 120m wide.  It looks like it's actually two adjoining rooms distance.  Considering that rooms can be quite small, and can be traversed quickly (especially those 4-door rooms, or L joints), it actually happens quite frequently that the client moves out of the active region.  The hall of mirrors is a classic effect.  In those cases, the only solution is to retrace your steps and hope that you get back into an active region.

But here's whats puzzling me.  Sometimes, if we haven't moved too far out of the active, the game resynch's itself.  Unlike the outdoor situation though, the client wins.  I understand the design choice here, as warping indoors is somewhat undesirable.  However, given the fact that the client needs certain information as it switches active rooms (i.e. mob descriptions), warping the server to the client's position has been causing more problems than it solves.  We're getting invisible mobs (the client missed getting the mob descriptor).  

What I'm suggesting now, is to just treat indoor desyncs the same way as you do outdoor.  That is, if it ever occurs, let the server win.  Warp the client back to where we SHOULD be.  That'll take care of the hall of mirrors.  And since the server has always been the one deciding what the client sees (i.e. mobs, chests, etc), there won't be any surprise disappearances.

If you're worried about users being jarred by the warping experience, it's still better than thinking everything's okay until you reach that mirror door barrier.  Not to mention that it's impossible to target an invisible mob as it currently is.  

I know this probably rolls back a lot of the code that you've placed in to make things theoretically smoother.  But network realities dictate otherwise.  Sometimes, simpler is better.

Prochyon @ 3/22/2002 1:42:29 PM (14710):
Hmm.. been reading the thread, and it's nice to see that misery loves company 
But seriously, I'm having the same frustrations as you guys. And I spent a lot of IP's in runspeed to avoid this. Only to find the door LOCKED on my way out? What is that ?
This has become a no-win situation. When I LD or crash, I just pray to God that just 1 of my teammates made it. 'Cause if noone did, there's no point in running. Just /terminate. Atleast it saves you a few seconds, as I know I'm gonna die anyway. It feels slightly better to die by your own hand than by those mobs... not much, just a wee bit 

I also wanted to add my 2 cents on the issues regarding re-entry spots and pets.

- I would like to have my re-entry point at my last save spot. Not in the 1st room. This because the door is usually locked anyway, and wouldn't serve any purpose to me as a re-entry spot. This has happened on too many occasions, so being locked inside in the 1st room and having to fight a loosing battle doesn't sound very appealing. Pulling alone as an Engi is kinda difficult. And I always get adds. So... I'm up for a re-entry at my last save point. Regardless of distance to my mission site or even where I was last hunting.

- Second is the eternal search for atleast masteries, so I can get my Guardbot. OE or no OE, Pulling out yellow bots is pathetic. Having Warmachines at L75 I can agree is OE/twinked, but Guards at L90 is quite acceptable. (And yes.. I'm 8 points short of a Semi-Sentient Guardbot. That's why I need masteries). What I'd like to see implemented is this:
If I'm logging, go LD or even crash, put my friggin bot back into my INV. So I can atleast call it up again if I still have my masteries. I'm not using Über-shotguns. Just these pee-shooters, so I'm pretty much a goner without my bot. I'm pretty much DoA if I manage to log back in after a crash anyways. And this thing that your bot is unique and that you can't have more than one in your INV at a time. This just make me run for the hills instead of summoning up a yellow bot. Which is not only timeconsuming and useless, buit you end up dead anyway. As we all know that nanocasting Engis in a fight, is a dead Engi 


Well... just something from my point of view and a little something to show my sympathy. I too have "been there, and done that". But my damn T-shirt hasn't arrived yet...


Cheers

Yes, blah blah, we know about the dot thing.

Point is, whether it worked as a result of the dot, or as intended (just plain killing off combat debuffs when running, regardless of the dot) it is now broken, whereas it was NOT before.

Why is it that you only see NTs, Soldiers, Traders and Docs in PvP zones?  Hmm....

I used to go there, but after last night I realized that since I have no way of ever breaking roots, if I get rooted, I'm going to sit there for 2:00 while someone kills me.  Doesn't sound like fun, does it?

Funcom we need this fixed, and we need an ETA NOW


"When it is possible for one class to consistently and completely destroy another class in PvP, without taking ANY damage themselves, the game is NOT balanced."

With things the way they are now, I basically get owned my Traders (duh), Agents, NTs, and Fixers, every time without fail, unless they are stupid enough to get close enough to me so I interrupt them.  What's in common?  Hmm...

Zaal @ 3/22/2002 8:15:53 PM (14710):
Proch this thread is more about server resets - not client crashes.  Easy to confuse really.

In a server reset - all team mates ARE kicked from a mission to the desktop getting a msg that there has been a problem with the server and to try logging in again.  When u log in again if you're player cahracter is still in the game you will see a countdown timer to log in using the character that is still inthe game.  VERY indicative of a server reset if you DON'T get this countdown timer.

In a client crash YOU WILL see the countdown timer and everyone who was there when u went LD or jsut plain old crashed will still be there waiting.

IN A SERVER reset, all the mobs RESPAWN.  In a client crash they do not.

BUMP!

did this yesterday walked in pulled one in to fight it, sicked my pet on it 7 mobs came running in. turned my aggro up put on my shot gun and there where mob bodies everywhere i had 10 health and my pet was dead. I was lucky that time. I knew i could run but i was just P'Oed. So i went to wailing on them. After that mission it hasn't happened to me since. lol.

Nepenthea @ 3/23/2002 8:55:32 PM (16500):
Greetings!

I'm just adding my "Me, too!" to this thread.

In shops and in missions, when a door is opened, I will freeze up completely for a few seconds. If I am moving before I freeze up, then after I am unfrozen, I'll be somewhere I wasn't just a few seconds before. My character appears to continue to move, yet my screen/system freezes up for a few seconds. Also, I hear a bit of static noise, a distortion or "hiccup" from the sound file that plays while doors are opened. I do experience the same door freezing problem on doors that make no noise, also (like the cave mission "vine" doors).

In shops, when people are zoning in and out, going to the Nano section and Trade section, I am constantly freezing up every few seconds. Quite frustrating.

In missions, by myself, I am able to approach a mission door between rooms and then make a complete stop when I am just at the door, let the door open up, let the freezing and jerking happen, then when that's done, then move forward in to the room. I do this while in sneak mode, so I have less chance of agroing a mob while my screen/system is frozen for a few seconds and I am unable to react/respond. Doing missions with anyone else is pure hell. Whenever someone else opens a door, I'm spun all over the place, ending up somewhere I wasn't expecting to go, completely disoriented and agroing a lot of mobs because my character is still moving while I am frozen. It's pretty disconcerting.

I've experienced this issue on two seperate systems. I've tried every "Visual" and graphic setting available. Nothing has improved the "door freezing" effect.

If anyone has any insight/resolution to this rather frustrating and often debilitating/dangerous issue, it'd be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks.

:-)

Also noticed a bug in the stats on a car I found ('The Mid') -- one of the stats was labeld '139MISSING = -200'.  Doh!

JFlack @ 3/23/2002 9:39:51 PM (15653):
I think there might be a 'few' *cough* different bugs that people are seeing.  Based on the title of the thread, I'll post what I've seen.

If my Agent successfully uses a 'Snipe' attack, then it is very likely (75%) that the MOB will continue hitting me after I've killed it -- my char stops shooting and stands there, the MOB keeps hitting and eventually falls down dead (5-20 secs later).  I can heal using a stim during that time, but can't sit/heal using a medkit.  The next MOB I attack, the 'buffered' attacks I had against the dead MOB occur. (ie, dead MOB hits me for 10 secs, and my weapon would normally fire 9 time during that period => My first shot against the next MOB results in 10 hits instantly!)

With the same character and a different gun (Fling shot instead of Snipe), this does NOT occur.

Maxburn @ 3/24/2002 1:52:18 AM (Only thing that surprises me... 17057):
Guys, I keep seeing sooooo many posts about bugs that are overwhelming all of us in this pathetically coded monstrosity of a game.  The only thing that surprises me is that anyone even bothers posting anymore (or letting funcom steal 14 dollars a month from them).  When was the last time anyone from Funcom actually responded to any of your complaints?  Or put anything in the news to give any of us any hope that will one day wake up?

Have any of you tried using the email link for funcom?  It doesnt even go the team, it goes to some moron who sends you an email saying there's nothing they can do.  Thats it!  One of my chars lost all his backpacks with all his eqp in them to a bank bug, a GM logged him and verified that is what happened and STILL said nothing we can do.  Said its a 'known' bug but there's nothing they can do about it.  Funcom does not now nor have they ever given a damn about their players.  They do not give players feedback or news on these problems simply because they are of the immature opinion that if you ignore a problem it will go away.  I heard recently that funcom bought asherons call, I feel so sorry for all those AC players who (before this buyout) had a pretty kewl game to play.

The only good news I can give you is that AC2 will be out sometime near the end of the year and so far its lookin pretty awesome and its Microsoft managing it, no matter u can say about microsoft when they release software it WORKS.  So hang in there and I'll see you on ac2 guys.

Gizzed @ 3/24/2002 3:02:18 AM (14710):
Yes, I agree, it is frustrating being in a mission and crashing and respawning. However it can be somewhat useful when you are in a room that had no NPC's when when respawn hits. Though of course it's still frustrating having to reclear all you've cleared previously, if you survive, it does mean more XP, and either case more cash from more kills.

My little atrox has had this happen a couple times. It's a shame Tokens aren't based on creatures killed.

After turning off texture compression and changing to 32-bit color mode instead of 16-bit color mode, the lag was much reduced, even though I am still using high-res textures. (My theory being that the texture-maps are in 32-bit color, and uncompressed by default - using 16-bit and compression causes the engine to convert and recompress the textures all the time, I believe.)
			
		
	
Yup, I'm already running this way (On a beefy system).  Actually, it doesn't matter whether the rest of the game is laggy or not on any particular day:  the doors are *always* laggy, no matter what.  "General lag" just makes them worse though...

Same with Graft, Organic and all the others, they spawn the same type of pieces of different QLs over and over.

This got broke after the patch that messed up the chests (which has been fixed) and added the Trader only shops.

Happens to me as well...

Sent a mail to support about it, and they said lower the graphics settings. I have GF 3, 1,33 Ghz, 512 mb ddr ram... and so on, so i should be good.

Did lower the settings... helped somewhat, but when it used to be lagless with high settings before ifs a pain to use those low settings.

MuscularBeaver @ 3/25/2002 6:00:57 AM (16674):
Yes. Not exactly the way you described, but yes, I've fought some dead guys.  Sometimes the fight gets so out of sync it would be hilarious if it weren't for the fact that my char could get killed by one of these zombies.

Checkbit @ 3/25/2002 7:01:22 AM (14677):
Yeah, I was wondering about that as well.  I've been going nuts trying to upgrade my chest piece and sleeves.  I've even taken to wearing cyber sleeves (God help me) because I can't find any steel ribbed.  The only way I have been able to find anything other than helmet/boots/gloves in that line of armor is through missions.  And I am not talking mission loot either. Just as a reward item.  *shrug*

Looks like a bug to me.

Checkbit @ 3/25/2002 7:03:51 AM (17153):
Well, I dont know if this would be considered a work around, per se. And it sure as heck is not a fix. But what I do is hit F8 twice. This will throw you into 1st person, then back to 3rd person. The angle will be the same, but the camera will zoom in on you really fast.  Seems faster than hitting the "+" key.


Hope this helps.

For those who realized I was temporarily insane and said "feel your, pain" and moved on, thanks. That is ALL the post was about.

Those who could not see that this was an irrational post and tried to tell me how it was my fault, you people are still idiots.

For those offended by my analogy, the analogy is perfectly valid. 

I said I was stuck zoning and killed, the response was that I should save my game. I replied that saving the game did not address the problem of the bug. The response to me was as absurd as someone telling a **** victim that her skirt was too short.

No, the problem is not with the victim at all, but the sickness of the perpetrator. So, I never claimed to be "raped" or even tried to compare the experience to it. The point was that the reponse to my post was as ridiculous as telling someone who is innocent that it was probably their fault.

If you can't grasp the analogy and think I am saying that I was "raped" or even something like that, then you totally missed the point. The analogy was to demonstrate faulty logic, period.

If you are still mad then you just want to be. Your issue, not mine.

Take home message:

I find it amazing that a three second rant can generate so many responses so quickly. Whereas, well thought out posts go almost un-noticed. A rant such as mine should generate 1 reply- "feel your pain- watch the profanity". 

If you can't recognize a rant (and what it means) when you see one, then you are probably a little dense.

Since last patch (20/03/02) a bug seems to have creeped in.

When i cast challenger to cyclops (the cheapest one), i don't do damage anymore except with brawls. that is, a lot of swinging and fast attacking, just no response in the text area and no damage being dealt. Brawl works fine. This continues until the nano lock is gone. Then everything reverts back to normal.

Did anyone else get this problem?

Also, it appears that since the same patch, i'm doing a hell of a lot LESS damage. (Doing 4 damage with a sword that has 4 as min. dam., but i'm also wearing 2 power rings +1 melee)

You will have to explain this repost to the others as they have put me on their "ignore" list, so I guess they won't see it. LOL

hehehe good comeback 

all i could see was people puring petrol onto a fire wondering why it was blowing up in their faces. 

true the profanity was perhaps not needed, but it is a good vent 

rants are rants. no need to add fuel to the flame 

I saw your analagy forwhat you meant, mebbe coulda used another one but I agree....

>>>I replied that saving the game did not address the problem of the bug.

As someone said in your other post, we all experience the same bugs and problems.....however, no need to aggravate it further with using petrol to piss on a fire 

Enjoy.

Taldrin @ 3/25/2002 11:34:41 AM (16381):
This can be a serious problem if the damage is done against you. Since FC decided to make runspeed determined client side , when a mob hits you for the first time the client spams a whole list of damage on you. Then your runspeed drops to an insanely low value because the client says you have 0 health, when in fact you will have near full. I've died before because of this, because I was too slow to escape.

You still made a poor choice in analogies but since you can't understand why it was offensive there's no point in arguing about it.

I would have been more likely to sympathize with you had it not been for that analogy and the profanity (particularly the KIND of profanity that you used).

Every time I try to delete a "No Item" from either my pack or bank. I get booted right out to windows as if I was never even playing AO. It gives me a form for submitting the "bug" but that appears to be bugged as well (bug report form froze). Not that this bug will effect me anymore. I have since gotten rid of all the no items I had.

hobbes @ 3/25/2002 7:49:07 PM (17182):
Laeni,

Honestly, I don't get what is wrong with the analogy. Maybe the subject matter is a bit controversial, but the point was to demonstate faulty logic, as you understand.

I do notice that you are sensitive to female issues such as the subject above and the slang I used for females, so maybe you might be a little likely to get unnecessarily offended by this topic. I'm just saying that we need to be aware of our own biases and realize we may snap at people unfairly. I think in this instance you were initially offended by the c-word and with this bias in place, you were very likely to read the analogy in a negative light.

If someone posts something that makes them seem like a total ass, I will often do a name search to look at some of their other posts. This will create more context into which you can interpret the current post. Sometimes an individual post will not be very representative of that person.
 
You would see that I am not stubborn and need to be right all the time. My reply here is an honest one. I think my analogy is valid. Any offense might reveal more about the reader than the poster. I refuse to avoid subjects to be PC, I dont play those games.

I explained why I left the profanity, but am not justifying it. It just feels so cathartic to get it out sometimes. 

I would have left the thread if others had not used profanity which I could not edit out. You would think I was the devil himself listening to those pepople work themselves to a froth, what a laugh. All in all I have no regrets or apologies for my rant, except for the noneditted profanity.

As a final note, look at people's signatures. Notice how incongruent my post was with my quote.

Detonate @ 3/25/2002 7:53:44 PM (17182):
If I remember correctly, you said you lost 2 days worth of work due to a server crash.

You have to admit, that is retarded on your part.

I think if you don't save in between 2 missions you are just begging to loose your XP.

You know the game, you know what happens, you have nobody to blame but yourself.

Why don't you just start writing a novel, and then when it storms at your house and you loose 300 pages of text cuss out God.

Of course, if your twinking a new char then that could be a prob.

Hobbes,

I was kinda shocked to see such a post coming from you, of all people.  And whatever I might think about that original post, I'm just glad you've taken a deep breath and have rejoined the world of the sane.  Welcome back 

So everyone, let's all hug and move right along.  Nothing to see here.  There's no point in dwelling on rant posts.  That much I've learned.

Almohada @ 3/25/2002 10:48:38 PM (Team members disappearing in missions 17292):
Recently, I've had the problem of while in a mission, your teammates will suddenly be invisible to you for no reason.  This makes you unable to heal them or otherwise assist them, even if you can still talk to them.  The fix is for one of you to zone.

I've noticed it happening a lot in the mission with the main corridor 6 branches layout, and in the cave mission with the big main room that has the fireplace in the back left corner you can walk through.

Has this happened to anyone else?  Does FC know about it?

Thanks.

-A

Almohada @ 3/25/2002 10:50:45 PM (16701):
I've had this happening a LOT in missions with Human mobs aggroing around corners and through SOLID WALLS.

I have lost so much XP because of this thing, and it is still happening.  I had it happen last night!

andthensome @ 3/25/2002 10:55:36 PM (Can't even play during prime time 17294):
I can't believe how crappy Funcom's servers/connections/programming is.  Whenever it gets close to prime time (around 4 pm - 10 pm central time U.S.) I constantly crash to dt whenever trying to zone into either 2OK or Broken Shores City of Home.  I thought they had made things more stable... and they did, for awhile; but then after 13.8 it seemed like load times were much slower and crashes were much more frequent.

I know this is nothing more than a rant, but Funcom really really needs to address this issue.

andthensome @ 3/25/2002 10:58:02 PM (17292):
yeah, the invisible bug is a known bug... by the players; don't know if it's known by funcom.  It sucks.

Pavaroso @ 3/25/2002 11:09:53 PM (17292):
It happens to my group all the time.   

Easy fix for us has been to have the invisible person run off by himself out of range (where the color of their name in the group window changes to show they are out of range) and then come right back.

Kuro @ 3/26/2002 12:11:31 AM (17294):
From experience visiting Broken Shores: don't go there 

Broken Shores is a graphically complex place to visit. My system. 1.2 ghz AMD Athlon with 1.5gigs of ram on a Gefore 2 MX 64mb of ram on a 1.5mbs cable modem, my frames per sec fluctuate about every 1/10th of a second. Some friends of mine on lower end systems time out when they get near large groups of people in BS. And the City of Home is a nightmare of chokepoints for groups congregating.

Tap, 

I cannot look you in the eyes now. I am not worthy.


Detonate,

There are two ways to approach a situation: to either be constructive or destructive. (Bug was not a server crash, but stuck on zone border). 

To say:

Really Hobbes, it is a shame about this bug, it is old and it is unacceptable for a commercial game, but if you are to be honest with yourself, you know that if you had saved more frequently the anger you experienced would have probably been avoided. Just a slight annoyance. Watch your language, thanks.

This would have both a sorry "about your loss", but as a community member you should control your language.


To say:

You are retarded for not saving, you know how this game is (you mean full of bugs and server instability-yes I do), you have no one to blame but yourself ( I didn't know I created that bug, maybe it wasn't ALL my fault, hmm) to someone who is angry to begin with is not helpful at all. (Saving btw doesn't fix this bug, it just helps with damage control)

So I think to myself, what is his motivation?
 Well seems to me by how you approach the situation you just want to add fuel to the fire. I find people like you to be a really frustrating part of this board.

Nietya @ 3/26/2002 1:27:15 AM (14677):
I'm typically not a cross-post referencing whore, but you know, in this case, this is all too valid.

You can get any kind of steel-ribbed from mission rewards.  Sleeves included, just an FYI...

It'd be nice if Funcom could do a little research into math randomization functions though.

...........

Same concept. Yes you can *safeguard* yourself against FCs bugs by continually saving. Doing, as Hobbes points out, does NOT fix the bugs!

You dear sire, are nothing but a pirhana. Nothing better to do than try and chew the **** out of others in the same pond.

At least Laeni had a *legitimate* complaint

Wow, now that is useful information. I thought that the large backpack was kind of unimpressive in size. Good post.

Did you get this information at Whatsamatta U. from Professors Rocky and Bullwinkle?

Ageny @ 3/26/2002 4:15:46 AM (17292):
Making the invis member run away a bit and return usually fixes the problem, yes. Annoying it is though, as you can't cast any nanos on a player you can't see, even if they can see you and stand beside you.

Shadowswan @ 3/26/2002 5:25:02 AM (Mysteriously disappearing skill pts 17346):
A strange thing seems to be happening periodically to my skill pts.
They go down a point or two.
The only reason I noticed is that I have exactly enough Treatment
and Time/Space pts to use my current nano-recharge and
treatment packs.   Three times so far it has happened that I
could suddenly no longer use those packs, because either my
Treatment skill or my Time/Space skill has DECREASED !!!
I don't think it's by a lot, perhaps a few pts each time, but
still, this is somewhat disconcerting.

Is it supposed to be that way?  If so, what triggers this behavior
(so that I can avoid those conditions in the future).  Or is this a
bug?  (if so, please fix ... soon)

thanx,
swan

Hextorr @ 3/26/2002 5:32:12 AM (17346):

Thx latest patch...breaking the once unbroken (or once fixed!)

Leumas @ 3/26/2002 9:23:16 AM (17294):
I think the problem lay in the increase of customer database and also the increase of player gathering around 20k whompa. Nows a day, I use to get 1 minute freeze and lag whenever I zone into 20k thou whompa in trade. Funcom definately have to rework their network coding to stop flooding the client side with large chunk of data. And the variety custom armor and weapon of player in AO suck. There is a reason why most mmorpg dun give so many custom player model. I dun think the original dev. take this into account.

Anyway, I doubt that this could ever be fixed. The only way to solve this is to upgrade your computer or lower your resolution and graphic settings.

Hello, please dont tell me off but I havnt emailed this thing I have found.

I used to hunt at the North East Mines near the Outpost at Harry's.  Everytime a Lifebleeder appears my robot automatically attacks it (which is handy) but if the Lifebleeder kills me I go back to the Outpost where I saved and my robot is already there, and it responds to commands, and acts like normal.

Perhaps it is just me, but this has happened three times now, and it always seems to be when I die at the radiation of a Lifebleeder.

This is very handy,  but I am sure its not meant to be.

Please dont tell me off for not emailing this but here it is.

Engineress @ 3/26/2002 5:32:04 PM (16043):
I thought the point of the backpacks was that when you wear it you get certain benefits from it.  I think you can carry and open any backpack inside the inventory.
As far as I know the only point to having the neccessary skill to wear the backpack is for the modifiers.

Arinia @ 3/26/2002 6:27:29 PM (13590):
Debuffs sorta work, except I tend to RESIST the debuff when rage is already running (which I try to keep running for extra init/speed).

Amazing that with 600 nano resist, I resist a QL5 general debuff nano about 40% of the time.

Working as intended?  Bah.

*calms self* OK, this thread is about Rage, Can we get a solid ETA (14.1, 14.2, etc, etc).  Numbers are good

It looks like this:  If you die in the same zone you scanned, your bot warps with you.  Otherwise, it becomes neutral, and stays where you died.

Even though you are mostly correct (Mostly? Yes, I have on occasion been unable to completely fill a small backpak fully due to weight, have always been able to completely fill a large one).

So if saving small change is important go for the small or medium pack.

Personally, I find the graphic to be the most important thing about the large ones.  I can find my stuff amongst my many packs that are on me and in the bank so much eaisier now!  I like saving the time, and the additional cost is small potatoes.  They say time is money, and that is true in this case as well.

If you use the graphic to distinguish types of backpacks, keep in mind that the unadorned large, medium and small packs are three more types.

For example, I do use small backpacks for my overflow loot (from missions, hunting, etc.) - stuff to be sorted thru later.  Medium backpacks for my "important stuff" that I want on me but don't want cluttering up individual inv slots.  Stuff like hackers tool, screwdriver, portable surgery clinic, health/nano refills, etc.

Cheers,
Martek

Skob @ 3/26/2002 9:01:47 PM (17346):
I noticed a similar thing the other day.  I was tweaking up a few attributes a few points in order to squeeze out an extra point in one of my skills (multi ranged), and after raising the appropriate attributes, I went back to the range page and it had gone DOWN a point instead of up.

I had already hit accept after moving up the main attributes, so I couldn't go back to play around with the numbers.  I'm almost positive I didn't have any buff son that could have worn off and affected this.

It was only 1 point I noticed, and was on my newbie twink engineer, so I didn't bother thinking about it too much or reporting it, but perhaps we do have a problem.

cryos1999 @ 3/26/2002 9:24:01 PM (16043):
Geeeeez am i the only one here that reads the  back pack discriptions.


 Most of ya are right about the large back pack but that is not the point.

 If ya have ever spent time and looked at the contents of the container machines  you would have noticed alot of diffrent looking symbols on the large back packs. It's not the size but the extra abilitie buffs some packs give ya. I have had a large pack of sprinting since lvl 25 and equiped it since lvl 35. It gives a +20 in your running skill. Some give pluses to other stats and for the most part they are just marked to keep all your stuff in a marked place. Hey once ya get 8 or 9 packs it does get a little confusing. 

  The requirements are placed onto the packs for you to wear and get the added benifits .

Didel @ 3/26/2002 9:42:30 PM (16043):
Actually those abilities have been there since the beninning of the game. 

The new ability enhancing backpacks on the other hand have only been around 2-3 patches. The biggest advantage I see for these is the ability to tell which pack holds what when you do have many of them.

Heya, 

This is my 3d char and hopefully my last that I am ever going to play due to these damn buggs!!!

I was stupid enough to belive u at Funcom actually fixed the tradeskills...So I took 50k IP and 1mill credits to make imps and maximise Weapon Smithing. To my surprise I only got to step 2!!
I bought books...yes all of them and tried to make melee weapons...then I bought all items needed for the weapons (Yes..all bought at Melee parts store and YES all the same ql even!!)..what happens..I follow the silly manual and only get to assemble the first part to the Construction Kit...When I try and add the next it says I cant..that the order is wrong or something.
I tried all weapons available for Melee weaponry...and none came past Step 2...NONE!!
I talked to an Ark that didnt know much about it..I checked every website for tradeskills there is...and this is a well known bugg.
Next maybe stupid question is this...WHY do u even implement Weapon bases when they cannot be used with any Construction kits or anything??..Yes...THEY DONT WORK...nor do your manuals say that u need them.
There is no way u are EVER going to give me back the 50k IP invested in a USELESS skill...all due too ur lack of fixing buggs...so Im not even going to ask for it.
I wrote this to hopefully try and make u aware that this doesnt work...I suggest u write a WARNING sign on all these kind of tradeskill shops...with the words "BUGGED..DONT INVEST IP ON THIS SKILL".
Im begging u...PLEASE make the tradeskills work...please...u have had MONTHS almost a WHOLE YEAR to fix it and u still havent done anything about it...PLEASE try and understand that this bugg is SUPERANOYING...FIX IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!

Haplo @ 3/27/2002 6:07:46 AM (Nano Critters attack you? 17526):
Every once in awhile, I run across nano critters.  they usually debuff the target like intelligence or something.  I try to use them on a MOB, but they get cast on me instead.  Anyone else ever have this problem?

Also, when i come to a new room, I usually get close enough to open the door and see the MOB in the next room to target them.  Occasionally, I cant target them, neither manually or by hitting tab.  This can get really annoying when i want to send my robo in when i use my engineer.  this way my pet will attack it and i can stay in other room, out of MOB's sight so it won't aggro me.

Another thing is when im flying around in my Yalm and i zone, they reset me to the ground.  Why is this?

mulps1 @ 3/27/2002 6:10:21 AM (17346):
OMG I'm not going mad afterall

This has happened to me on a couple of occassions lately, just the loss of a point or 2 that is only noticeable as i'v e been quite stretced for ip's recently and only allocateing enough to just use certain nano's etc.

I initially thought it was due to a buff or 2 not being in place but checked and realised they were all active, i even zoned and re cast them to make sure.

I'm going to save a screen shot of my stas when i get home an see if it happens again.

MuscularBeaver @ 3/27/2002 6:35:53 AM (17346):
Happened some months ago.  I even noticed for the same reason.  I had my treatment and first aid skills at exactly the level I needed for my kits, and suddenly the kits stopped working.  I check my skill points and they had dropped a few.

Angeleye @ 3/27/2002 8:50:39 AM (16424):
Yep, you can wear a 1k token board from lvl100 (the requirements are title level 4)...

And I have no problems activate and show my 1k token board...

Krneki @ 3/27/2002 9:17:38 AM (16424):
I can't show my 1000 board either. When I right click on it, it just unequips and appears in my inventory.

Chill @ 3/27/2002 10:30:14 AM (17346):
It also happens to me now and then but it goes back to the normal value when I zone.

Guido @ 3/27/2002 12:30:26 PM (14677):
Flowers armor seems fine. I bought my MA a pair of QL100 gloves and sleeves. And I saw pants, armor... but you know, I don't recall seeing a helmet. Hmm.

You won't either, they don't come up now..ever.

If you want there are tons of Graft and Organic helms but don't look for a Graft or Organic chests they never show up but Titan Plasteel Chests are abundant and so on, each set type has pieces that never show up.

There are absolutely no str/sta boots in the Superior shops I have to use Flowers (Agl)  or the Graft or Organic I get in quests that a 70 Atrox Enforcer can do, which means boots around my same level. Yeah they don't want OEing but won't provide low level stuff (under QL125) that we can buy to fit in self buffed.

Yeah I can buy in auction if I spend hours listening (RK-2) but that's not the point, I want to be self-sufficient at least till I outgrow the shop stuff.

It is so messed up.

Engineress @ 3/27/2002 1:29:30 PM (17518):
I have made weapons ok, but there again I made ranged weapons.  I could try making a melee tonight and tell you tomorow what I found.

Misophist @ 3/27/2002 5:21:34 PM (17445):
Are you serious? You're going to try and play with this character?

I guess you are.

Uh, your best bet would be to delete that character and start over. You ain't going to get very far if you can't raise your skills. And I'm sure not going to donate to the "keep the buggy avatar alive" fund. Sorry.

Greenhawk @ 3/27/2002 7:51:56 PM (16381):
I presume this is a lag-related problem, but it is getting MUCH worse.  Today had a case where a mob continued to hit me for a full minute after death... and eventually killed me through chain-healing from two members of my group, dishing out several thousand points of damage after death.  I received the exp for the kill on the mob after dying and resurrecting, while back in Omni-Trade (mission in Clon****).

Though you can (usually) run away and wait for the mob to realize it is dead, it is extremely frustrating.  It is a "known issue", but one that is progressively getting worse...

cryos1999 @ 3/27/2002 9:41:16 PM (16043):
Really?

 Welll slap my ass and call me susie...lmao I wasn't really aware the skill packs are that new.

  The only pack that gives any type of usefull skill buff is the sprinting. This is usefull to me, because i am mostley the PMD monster puller in my team.

  Beleive it or not a plus 20 in your run skill is really helpfull if ya haven't gotten the use of your yahm yet. Lets face it every little bit counts if ya have to run to all your missions.

I agree I still use Quickness at 124 if I have the NCUs available.

LeChuck79 @ 3/27/2002 11:19:46 PM (16674):
this happens to me all the time. it's actually getting really annoying. once, however, i died with 50 hp's left after the fight was already over... so, PC's can be zombies too!

LeChuck79 @ 3/27/2002 11:23:43 PM (943):
one more bug: the map disappears after i alt-tab out of AO and back. so, i usually have to relog. that's not a very pleasant thing to do...

Greenhawk @ 3/28/2002 12:05:59 AM (16674):
Bottom line, expect to see this a lot now.  It is a bad lag issue, and is worse than it used to be.  I've had mobs stay alive in excess of a minute kicking my ass after they're dead.  When you're fighting deep reds, that's not a good thing.

So far, I can chalk up over 1 million exp to this bug...

Yup, if the dead mob is still hitting me, I run for the exit. Kind of annoying because the map resets, but it's better than sitting at reclaim for 5 min because of a stupid bug.

Tetra @ 3/28/2002 12:11:05 AM (when zoning indoors qwings drops but NCU's dont recalculate properly. 17613):
When zoning from outdoors with qwings on it drops from NCU list and it's affect goes away but the actual NCU's dont get recalculated (the number changes client side but the 32NCU's qwings used are unusable).

Currently have 314 NCU and when buffed with 
Int boost (3ncu)
MC Expertise (4ncu)
TS Expertise(4ncu)
BM Expertise (4ncu)
PM Expertise (4ncu)
SI Expertise (4ncu)
Infuse BM (38ncu)
Infuse PM (42ncu)
Infuse SI (41ncu)
Odins eye (51ncu)
Mochams MC (51ncu)

drops me at 246/314NCU's but if i zone in with qwings I am unable to cast Mochams TS (50NCU) until i zone without qwings active.

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 12:59:15 AM (Toxic Substance bug/exploit. 17622):
If you kill a mob while it is standing in a toxic substance you get ZERO xp for the kill, the game assumes that the toxic substance is NPC damage. This seems to also be the case for PvP damage, if you stand in toxic substance when the killing blow lands, the opponent gets no credit for the kill. So those of you that get ganked coming out of mission areas in the political zone near Rhino Cockpit, head for the ole Rio Green river...

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 1:17:04 AM (15653):
I'm getting this crappy bug too, it sucks ass when you get killed AFTER you've already killed the mob and can't even attack it anymore. And of course we all know how helpful it is to summon one of Anarchy Online's doorgreeters, the ARKs... they'll read you the nice little post-it note they all get in the mail from Funcom the day after they answer the cute in-game trivia... "I'm unable to help you with this current issue, please submit an email to bugs@anarchy-online.com. Is there anything else I can help you with?"

Gizzed @ 3/28/2002 1:42:08 AM (14710):
I don't think there are as many system crashes now as Anarchy used to be at times.

If funcom is reading this, this should be the primary bug that should be fixed ASAP. Right now it's probably the biggest, most frustrating bug I know of, though it hasn't happened to me for a little while.

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 3:01:11 AM (INSANE regeneration on mobs. 17631):
Have any of you watched the health bar on mobs in missions lately, some of them are regenerating at an insane amount. I've been trying to pay a little closer attention to this over the past couple of days, it's been more of a problem since the latest round of bugs with 'dead' mobs still attacking. While a mob continues to regen at this insane amount, if you 'kill' it and it keeps regening, you cannot attack and yet it is getting healthier. If there is another mob in the room that starts 'insta/chain' healing it will actually 'revive' that dead mob and it will continue attacking you until either you zone or die because if you try to attack back it says 'this creature is alread dead'.

On top of all of this is another serious bug you should be very aware of... if there is a long pause in a battle where it appears that the mob has just stopped attacking for no reason, or your pet and the mob both have stopped attacking each other, DO NOT get aggroed!!! You will suddenly find that you are attacked with a series of 'stored up' attacks on the server side of the combat. Your screen will suddenly insta-spam with a dozen or more hits, usually resulting in you being quite dead.

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 3:06:18 AM (Auto-equipping the wrong crap. 17634):
What the hell is with sleeves auto-equipping to the wrong side?  If I try to equip something on the RIGHT arm why the hell does it equip to the LEFT side?! Yeah yeah, I know all about taking off the currently equipped sleeve before equipping the new one. But hell, this is like my third bug report just for today, seems like I've been submitting this bull**** for the past few weeks on a continuous basis.

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 3:46:29 AM (Damage Nanos sometimes HEAL mobs. 17638):
I've noticed that sometimes my damage nanos heal mobs when I cast it on them. Just today I was fighting a Rookie Martial Artist in a mission, I cast Mind scream on him and his health actually INCREASED. I didn't think anything of it until later when I was fighting another orange conning Martial Artist, this time the fight started going badly for me due to the mob chain casting heals and insta casting them until it was back to a little over half of its health. So, during this fight I start casting Mind scream and TWICE in a row as the damage pops up 78 pts each time to be exact, the mobs hit points actually went UP instead of down. There was no 'heal' graphic on the mob showing that it just insta healed itself again either. I strongly urge you all to start paying close attention to the mobs health bar in combats for a while, stop looking to at the message window to see how many 'points' it says your doing, look at the mob's health bar to see what your really doing...

Isaah @ 3/28/2002 4:55:51 AM (Vanishing mob corpses, and aggro from nowhere. 17641):
I've taken a few missions in Grimeyvault now, the one that has the look of tattered curtains for doors and torches on the walls. Anyhow, in these missions mobs will aggro from ALL over the mission area. I can be fighting a mob in the front hallway and have something four or five rooms removed aggro and come speeding into the room. And during several of these occassions the mob falls to the ground giving NO xp reward, or even message that you can loot the remains. As it is hitting the floor it is already starting to fade out even. The aggro issue is my prime concern, I've had this do a chain reaction of sorts a couple of times that results in 10 or more aggro message from different mobs...

Pie314 @ 3/28/2002 9:26:02 AM (17153):
sometimes repeatidly hitting "5" in the keypad will zoom you in fair chunks at a time. Usually takes around 5-6 quick presses to zoom you back.

SOMETIMES that is., sometimes it won't work, sometimes it will only zoom you in to the normal maximum distance, other times i will zoom into the normal distance but opposite angle like it is suppose to.

Bierbauch @ 3/28/2002 1:03:17 PM (17634):
I think we all hope this would be the most important bug in AO

Oberan @ 3/28/2002 2:42:05 PM (17613):
another thing i noticed thats similiar (parrot form)

If i zone indoors using parrot form. I loose about 1500hp. Thats all the hp i get from my token board and my mk2 armor

I dont know if it has something to do with hp being recalculated because parrot is -250 hp but i have noticed the same problem as you

Greenhawk @ 3/28/2002 4:56:22 PM (16674):
I definitely run for the hills when I realize it is happening.  Sadly, though, sometimes the mobs are either fast enough to prevent escape that way, or able to just hit you anyway with the "running into the wall double hit" bug.  I've had level 80 rollerrats blow me away this way from several rooms away.

This bug will be the death of AO if it gets much worse.  I already know two people who've quit because of this and other similar bugs that introduce frustration.  My hope is that it is on their radar and they will come up with a fix soon.

Hmm, I've seen that before. I 've  been killed by the MOB after he was dead & the corpse  looted. I was still getting wacked, and no it wasn't some DOT nano either. it was weapon damage.

Another thing that has happened. when I started a battle with a MOB i would use "fling" then "burst". but when I press the burst button. I get a message that I have to wait for the last "special attack to finish?? weird so I wait the fling button is ready to be used again. so I figure that the burst skill can go....NO way I get the same message again. so i press "fling" no problem it worked. why not the burst....so i pull down the 'action menu' press the burst button there and wha-la. it goes off. what the hell is that all about?

Greenhawk @ 3/28/2002 10:09:33 PM (17638):
Showed it to an ARK yesterday... it seems to happen when multiple damage sources come in at once.  If the nano or MA special attack hits last, it heals the mob instead.

Seen it with every MA special... and it is VERY repeatable.

celestialfury @ 3/29/2002 6:43:56 PM (16674):
I don't get it as bad as some of the others, but whenever I BARELY kill a mob, it stands there, and keeps blasting me. Then it would die as I'm frantically running away.

Of course, I don't get my hitpoints back, or I would die, then watch it die, then I'm looking at the reclaim terminal.

Only way I've been able to avoid it is when the mob is about 5% health left, I'd nuke it with my biggest NF/special/whathaveyou that I'll know will do 10% of its health.They seem to die and not wake back up.

Medwar @ 3/29/2002 8:31:53 PM (17518):
No offence intended....but FC has had more than a year to fix teammissions and tradeskills....they still got buggs everywhere and are only concerned with nerfing the few players that exists.
Furthermore Im hoping I wont be around for that long...till they decide to fix the tradeskills.My only hope is that Lucasarts finish SWG faster soI can change game pronto.
Less buggs, less lagg, listening to players= perfect game...FC doesnt fit to that description!

Virind @ 3/29/2002 8:50:21 PM (17518):
yeah, trade skills are almost totally useless in this game. They're far too compicated, badly thought out, expensive and the final result is almost never better than what you could just buy from a shop, or find in a mission. 

I tried to make a mausser partical streamer SMG the other day for a friend who's starting a fixer. Well, I couldn't even get to step ONE!!. I bought the parts, and followed teh manuel. I tried to put the explosive chamber into the smg kit .... NOTHING. Not even an error message. Just nothing. I spent all freaking day trying to figure it out. 

the only things worth making are the pharmatech stims and treatment kits (although they're hideiously expensive), implants, and high level rare nano crystals. 

Don't bother working on any other tradeskill for now. It's just not worth the headache

Oh, crap. And just signed back up last night, after getting sick of DAoC. I'd heard the bugs were much better, the gameplay much improved ... I shouldn't have believed it. Now they've suckered another $34 bucks out of me. Dammit!

I'm going to pretend I never read this, and just see what happens. If I still get this bug, though, I won't believe a word I read from Funcom ever again. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.

After spending an hour tonight shopping for my alt, I've decided that shop respawn is definitely carp... I mean, why do the same objects need to be in the shop for 2 hours or more?  Is it so that if I don't have the $ to buy the item, I can go do a mission to get it, then come back? Lol!!  That's not quite how it works...  By the time I went to get the $ I would've leveled past the item anyways, making the whole thing irrelevant...  And sorry, but the $ from 1 mission isn't enough to pay for a new weapon, so it isn't going to work..

BrontoCowboy @ 3/30/2002 12:24:32 PM (943):
This is a really small bug, of not much consequence, but it was odd so I thought I'd bring it up.

That's actually the response i've had from a GM :

http://www.websatya.com/petition.jpg

WTF is wrong with this game, and those GM's ???

You can move a char from a dimension to another, but you can't check a trade log to see if it's correct that i was trading when the server crashed ?


Hello,
 
the server of borealis crashed, on 30 march 2002, at 18h40 (approximatively),
 
my character was in trade, with angessombre, for 15 millions creds + a pillow ql 56, when logging back on neither she of me, had the money and item.
she (named angessombre) also lost some bags from her bank.
 
 
The answer we got from the GM was : 
 
[Sirmordred] : Hi this is a GM. We are very sorry, but we are still not able to reimburse. we are very sorry for this. (I can give you the screenshot of this)
 
Nothing else,
 
so i want you to CHECK MY TRADE LOGS, and give me my money back !!!
And giving such an answer is for me totally unacceptable !
 
If i have nothing done to help me, i will send this mail till I get some decent help.
 
Thank You

Yep... you notice that loot is bugged too? Lots and lots of Mort and Newland maps, plus certain items no longer respawn in shops such as Blessed with Thunder, MA attack. 

Is it just me, or does the AO code seem so intertwined that you change one thing in it, another changes? I can't wait for all of us to be standing on our heads when we log in.

Good grief. I still remember the PvP "fix" patch that made human mobs nearly god like...

He said "let me clarify" and killed me with one hit.

Isaah @ 3/31/2002 2:58:22 PM (Stored up pet attacks, bug or goood 'use'? 17991):
The other day me and an engineer friend of mine were hunting in the Varmint woods, we don't go too far in as we are in our 40s and 50s level wise. However after fighting in there for a little bit my and his pet started to attack for thousands of points of damage each time we hit the /pet attack macro. The screen would literally scroll with hits of 200, 150, 250, 175, etc...
We did this on a couple of mobs then thought we'd try a really hard one, and it worked on it too. The only drawback was that the mob didn't die right off, and we couldn't cast on it or attack it because it said that it was already dead. BUUUT, here's the really cool part, each time we did /pet follow, then /pet attack it RE-spammed all the attacks again. What this did for us is make the mob almost immoble it was moving so slowly. We knew a place where a Blaster Beetle hung out so we went over there and thought we'd try it on that since we could always run if things got bad, we knew the Blaster beetle would be moving like pond water and couldn't possibly catch us.

  Needless to say at my level which at the time was 47th I got 10% of my level in xp every single kill. Here's the only drawback to the whole thing, the blaster beetle didn't die right off, so we had to re-summon a couple of pets each and keep sending in to kill it. BUT when we picked up aggro on the beetle it followed US at suuuuper slow speed while the pets ate its ass from behind, kinda like old Everquest Kiting. The cost in Engineer pets was easily reimbursed when we looted that critter, it dropped about 4k in cash, plus we both got 10% of our level in xp. It took a bit of random fighting before the pet (my pet only this time) started 'storing up' the attacks, but after it did we decided it was time to visit the Blaster Beetle again. Much to our joy it was re-spawned and almost as easy to kill as last time. 

  I've been told there are a few other 'uses' for some of these new bugs...

WGMelchior @ 3/31/2002 4:49:50 PM (17991):
It is indeed a bug. It happened to me (my player character) yesterday. I even died of it, and couldn't move at all, but I was still attacking.

Lelou @ 3/31/2002 5:05:25 PM (17916):
Well, you aren't the first person this has happened to, and I'm sure you won't be the last!

/me was quite irritated when she lost two full bags of varying QL shotguns due to FC server crash.

Same story tho, sorry we don't reimburse items at this time.

So, is there ever going to be a  time that items will be reimbursed?

I havent cared much and still dont but it would still nice to have one that i can use. I got it when i was lvl 1 in the newbie area.

Now when i go back i cant get in anymore.
I dont want to delete my key, might cause even more trouble.

Anyone had this problem and solved it?

Guess what?  Last night I tried to sell an implant from my pack to the shop term, and it said "Can't trade from pack - yet."  Then, I picked up another implant from the same pack, and it worked just fine - straight from the pack to the shop term window...  This is definitely buggy.

Isaah @ 3/31/2002 8:43:28 PM (Crotalus poison bug. 18018):
When using the Crotalus staff mobs will sometimes interrupt the poison DoT that it procs, BUT here's the message you get, and this is what makes it odd...

 "Rock Blubbag's casting of 'poisoned' has been interrupted by Rock Blubbag"

It would seem to me that somehow the proc of this staff has been coded to make the mob think it is casting a hostile nano onto itself. This has happened about three times over the past 4 days, the thing that makes it odd is that I'm not being attacked so it isn't interrupting anything that I personally am doing, and it isn't a normal resist, that staff gets resisted 99% of the time and when it does you just don't get any messages at all, but when it procs you see "<target> has been poisoned for 20 points of damage".

Taldrin @ 3/31/2002 10:42:37 PM (17991):
This is a client side bug, which is why it does not die straight away even though it's health may seem to be 0. What seems to happen is if you don't register any of the damage from a previous fight, it stores that up until the pet hits the next mob once. Then you see a huge list of damage, when in fact the mob has only been hit once.

Now a side effect of this. If this effect happens to you, your runspeed will drop dramatically because funcom placed runspeed calculations client side. You seem to have 0 health, but keep fighting because you actually have only been hit once.

Isaah @ 4/1/2002 12:29:51 AM (17991):
When fighting mobs and dropping thier health to zero, they actually start moving very slowly also. It does of course work both ways, I've had my health do that and it made me run very slowly also. So mob's run speed calculation must be done server side and ours may be done client side (although I would think it very easy to hack the run speed of a player if any type of movement were done client side). Some of you old school EQ players may remember that 

...After talking with a GM about it in game I was told that it was some kind of Sync problem with the client and server, and that it was supposed to be a fix scheduled for the next patch. If the side effects of this bug are letting me kite mobs double my level or more with little to no risk... they can wait a patch or two..

This may be obvious but are you in the right newbie area? There are many of them and it's easy to enter the wrong backyard. Only the one you started in will work even though all the others look identical in each start town.

If the key is in a bag it won't work, it needs to be directly in your inventory. If that's not your case then I don't know.

Win Me (with latest MS updates)
1024 X 768 resolution
16 bit colour

Bug 1:  ALT+TAB out of the game to another app, and then ALT+TAB back into the game to find the geometry of the characters and some of the buildings incorrect (i.e. upside down and half buried in ground).  Must logout to correct.

Bug 2: Sometimes there is serious disparity between the time I kill a MOB and the MOB actually dying (i.e. I automatically stop firing because it's got no points left, but it's still up and attacking me.  I try to fight back but I get a message saying taget is already dead.  In some cases this situation lasts for 5 or 6 seconds).  Seems to get worse as I move through the mission.  

Bug 3: During a mission, I'm running from a MOB that uses a melee attack.  I use a speed stim.  I have two rooms distance between the MOB and I but it still manages to inflict damage on me.  

Bug 4: During a mission, sometimes the game slows to a crawl, somewhat like slow motion.  Opening up the area map will fix this in some cases.  

Opinion:  I see alot of things being worked on for the 14.0 patch (i.e. new colours for the text chat) but I read nothing about FC fixing some of the serious problems with basic gameplay functionality.  

Thanks,

Splinter

Tinaja @ 4/1/2002 6:35:04 PM (Losing tokens (overflow) with 2 bags open 18113):
You can reproduce this.

Complete a mission with full inventory.  When the overflow window opens, open your inventory, right click on a backpack to open it, so you can clear some inventory space, notice that it is full and open another one - the second backpack will overwrite the overflow window, with no way of recovering it.  I've lost several tokens this way, accidentally.

Please make the overflow window a separate window, or do an inventory check upon leaving the mission area.  If there is room in your inventory when you leave the mission, anything in overflow should automatically be put into inventory.  This might be the easiest way to solve this problem programmatically...

Tinaja @ 4/1/2002 6:47:57 PM (Biomech armor shortage? 18115):

Ill mail Funcom to see if they can fix me an apartment in Ent or Trade.

Greenhawk @ 4/1/2002 10:10:04 PM (17638):
It seems not to be only the damage from the nano attack that is healed... I had the misfortune of doing that "heal them" thing with a 1014pt Brawl... it healed the mob to full from nearly half damage.  Same situation... hit/special attack/2x nano attack all hitting at once (Blessed with Thunder, Da Taunter, Brawl, Punch x 2)... Brawl healed everything the rest did and then some.

AnotherFixer @ 4/1/2002 10:16:37 PM (16424):
I just got my 1000 board today and just like the others, I cannot display it.  It unequips when I right click it.  Not only that, but when you put it back on, you're minus the 700 HP that it gives and have to heal back up.

Another wonderful bug.

Miriandel @ 4/1/2002 11:02:16 PM (16424):
neither.

Definately a bug, but not worth fixing it IMHO

Miriandel @ 4/1/2002 11:06:12 PM (17638):
but a server sync problem.

When the server gets out of sync, which happens very often (who sait TCP is not a concern ?), mobs don't seem to die, we all know that.
They just stand as zombies, you can't attack them anymore, and you still take damage.

When you fight the next mob, for some odd reason, the damage you "should" have made to the zombie is immediately substracted from the fresh mob HPs, which is a glitch.

To "resync" some professions can cast HPs nanos, like the trader drain-life line, and it resets the problem.

dislocator @ 4/2/2002 1:37:13 AM (broken beams and funcoms fix 18170):
hi all,

i had a long battle with equiping beams over hte last three months. my enf is lvl124 and i was having big time problems gettin my ql199 beam on. i wrangle and did challenger and had all the requirments but i would always get u need 1008 2hblunt to equip. now of coarse i had well over the reqirment, 1024 2hblunt outta do it. so many times i spoke to gms in game and sent bugs all the while being crippled using a (ack no) ql200 hammer or most of hte time i used a ql146 beam. So to say the least i was bummed to be denied my dream beam. So most of the time i figured it was the beam itself, and went on a search to find a ql200. last friday i recieved my ql200 beam and found a wrangle but noooo! same error. ugh! I felt the gms were gonna just say send report bug and that would be that. i really wasnt looking forward to the repetiton of this problem. So i submitted on sunday and after waiting it out i was hooked up with a gm who asked me about my problem. after explaining all that had happen he asked if he could check my character and the beams. i logged out and he logged in as me, after an hour (wow i was really impressed that support would spent this amount of time). soon i saw he was logged out and i went back in. my character was the same and the gm looged abit later and said he'd found sum problem with my character. I always felt that it must be the character and all the patching and old items and such. After finding a wrangle i cast challenger and zoned (just in case) and b000000m! it equip'd. It was maddeing to say the least, but now after goin through the channels of reporting and repetitioning to the final solution i can say thank you funcom for all the support. cya at the eye camp baby!

Wiwaxia @ 4/2/2002 5:13:49 AM (14710):

Kill and back to mission

Nobody from FC reads these boards anyway. Send an email to FC instead. Do you really think anyone cares about this bug when there are problems like the massive sync-bugs ?

Haxaw @ 4/2/2002 11:34:18 AM (943):
You can't sell the "Pick-Up"-Items of the Missions directly from the Bags. I guess this was implementet, because it was able to rightclick the "Retrieve"-Items on the Missionterminal and keep them, if they where in your Bag. (long ago)

Some Bugs:

- Bugged doors in missions (I've experienced mostly if I'm running through missions while MOBs are chasing me) . You are stucked in a room. If you are not in a fight, just relog. If you are fighting and you can't see the MOB, you are dead because the MOB shoots double as fast as normal.

- MOBs wont die. (Allready mentioned here somewhere but still a prob). Sometimes it displays ~10 hits with the first hit I make. A MA Specialmove can sync the healthbar of the MOB again.

- Healthbars on the Teamdisplay are bugged. (Not showing damage taken and stays at 100%, even if I'm nearly dead)

- MOBs hit while casting (programming) Nanos. Once the NF ist castet, it shows me a doublehit on the Chat, that I've allready taken while the MOB is casting (check healthbar when the MOB starts casting).

- Nanos hit your NCU just when the MOB is starting to cast the NF, doesnt matter what attacktime the NF needs. No chance to interrupt the Caster.

- MOBs are off for a walk now . Sometimes the MOBs are wandering arround. Yesterday I've found 5 MOBs in small room. No time to make a screenshot. 

- MOBs stuck in walls. Especially if you are running away. They disapear and hit you wherever your are.

- MOBs and parry. Was it intended that even yellow NPC-NTs have a Parry skill, that is far and beyond my level? (had that allready with level 80 while wearing a full set of of ql 125 Implants).

- Money sometimes disapears if the trade (with other player) is cancled. (zoning does NOT help! The Credits are gone!)

- Flower of Life is bugged. You suffer damage if you use it instead of healing you.

- The Pathing of the MOBs is crap. Some MOBs just start running arround and into other rooms and pull some more MOBs to you if you don't stop hitting them (while they are in another room).

- Ahh yeah, the Physical Init for MAs is bugged btw...

I beleive people from Funcom DO read these boards, they may not take action on every single topic they see, and they may not even read all of the threads (or even half of them for that matter). And to answer your question as to whether or not I think anyone cares about this bug in the face of the current 'sync' bug, I say yes. If no one cared, do you think there would have even been a post on the issue? Now, do you think that trolling posts on the 'little' bugs will garner you any more recognition for the greater bugs in the game? And if you truly believe no one from Funcom reads these boards why post here, more specifically why start threads with such titles as "Fix the Server!"?

If taking the initiative and starting threads on bugs (big or small) isn't your cup of tea, then why not just stay out of them, or at the very least not post unless you have something to actually contribute to the subject. I've gone back and read a great many of the threads that you've posted on, and I'm absolutely certain you can keep your hands full, and post count up by debating with the naysayers on Enforcer/Atrox issues.

Bierbauch @ 4/2/2002 2:45:58 PM (17634):
Well sure its important to care for every bug in this game. But as I mentioned better write an email to Funcom. Btw my answer wasnt meant as trolling. Think about it again ... wouldnt AO be an awefull game if the described bug was the most important bug to care about ?

Greystar @ 4/2/2002 3:36:10 PM (18113):
Similar thing happens when you don't close the overflow window.

While making implants the result often goes into overflow. When I take the implant out of there and put in a new cluster the implant doesnt go into the still open overflow window, it just vanishes.

Kuro @ 4/2/2002 4:16:08 PM (18113):
I've noticed for a long time now you can only have 2 containers open at the same time, regardless of what kind of container they are. So if you have a chest and a bag open, the next time you open a new container (another bag, the overflow window pops, ect.) the first container you opened will automatically close.

Neylana @ 4/2/2002 5:48:39 PM (Token Board Def. Add? 18241):
Ok Ive done a search on this and I cant find this possible bug anywhere on the forums.

I first noticed that with the 120 board it say that it adds 1 to def. but in taking it off and putting it back on I saw no diffrence in my AC's or evades.  I thought oh well it just must be me and Im not seeing something right and it was just one point.

Now I have my 250 board and it is doing the same thing.  It adds the one point to my offense but not the 3 points to my defense. 

So is this a bug or am I missing something,  Ive checked my evades and my AC's before and after putting on the token board and see no diffrence.  So if someone else could check this out and let me know it would be very helpfull

Krneki @ 4/2/2002 6:03:02 PM (18241):
It adds to your DMS, which is not displayed like AMS.

Arinia @ 4/2/2002 6:08:17 PM (17634):
Make sure your multi melee or multi ranged is correct.  That will cause this.

Never equip by right clicking on the item, always drag to and from the slot.

I used to have this problem taking off and putting on my pillow in my left hand while buffing, now that I'm a little more careful everything is fine.

He then told me to, "Turn 1/4". In about as much time as it took me to say WTF??? he then whacked me. One hit and I was dead. Who and what the hell is Metalomania?

Aeriala @ 4/2/2002 7:58:09 PM (17916):
No they do not reimburse and sending them 50 emails or harrassing the GM's will NOT help they will just threaten to ban you from the game completely.
  I know this for a fact as it happened to my husband.
Do you know why they can't reimburse you?  Because they do NOT keep logs.
  That must suck though to lose 15 million credits.  Ouch!

Miriandel @ 4/2/2002 8:14:50 PM (What's this new lag in towns ? 18256):
Upon zoning in most crowded areas, characters are unable to do anything but chat.

It's not a connection issue, otherwise we wouldn't be able to talk (different servers), but for 1 to 3 minutes, it's impossible to use the scaner, zone in a shop, or even open a bag.

It's as bas as in last June, it seems the internet coding of AO is completely screwed up !

Two containers (bank/backpack/overflow/chest/critter loot) other than the inventory window.

Anyone else having mission mobs go through the cute little death animation after you kill them and then instantly 'green out' like you've looted them, AND give you no xp? I've been having this occurr more frequently of late, and the way over popularized 'door greeters' known as ARKs give the same reply each time... "Sorry, there is nothing we can do for you at this time. However that is a known issue and we are working on it."

Forth @ 4/2/2002 9:50:48 PM (18262):
Yep, seen that a few times.  Was the critter DoT'ed, by any chance?  

If it dies to the DoT (or at least, it used to), then since the killing blow wasn't from a PC, but some_unknown_damage , then you won't get xp or loot and the corpse will vanish.

Along the lines of the toxic waste getting the last attack in; and same thing happening.


First time that happened to me I thought my pet had decided to start looting corpses.

Wierd.

Khayne @ 4/3/2002 12:18:29 AM (18170):
I dont think you quite got the point here Yme. The point is that his char was bugged and they got it fixed. They did not help him overequip (he managed that nicely on his own), they just "debugged" his character so he could do the same as every other player can.

Isaah @ 4/3/2002 12:36:21 AM (18262):
Nah, no DoTs or anything. And the few times they vanished like that it has been on 'non toxic' ground. That is pretty funny about the pets looting... <glares sternly at his Wrath Incarnation>

When he needs to reload clip (using novaflow) and the inv. is empty (cause its all in reclaim..) he deequips the gun, and starts using fists. Ive written about this in the soldier forum and alot of soldiers are experiencing the same problems.. Ive sent bugreports and petitioned, will we ever see this fixed!?

NightShade @ 4/3/2002 5:39:00 AM (18262):
I had something kind of similar happen to me yesterday.  I killed the thing but it didn't give me any experience (and I'm not talking about a grey, even though those give you 1 point).  The body didn't disappear, and I got credits from looting it.  I just didn't get any experience.  Kind of strange.

Edit:  By the way, I'm an adventurer and the last hit was a melee blow, so there was no DoT damage; I'm pretty sure my damage shield isn't what delivered the killing blow, unless I got a hit in while he was falling.  At any rate, I would think that if that was the case, the my damage shield kept me from getting experience, it would have happened sometime previously in the past seven months.

Ialos @ 4/3/2002 5:58:50 AM (dual wield pistol and 1he bug 18319):
i just started AO recently, and i thot it would be cool to dual wield these weapons with my solitus adventurer, however i have encountered a strange problem...

i equipped a pistol in my right hand, and a squibber(?) that requires brawl and dimach skills in my left hand, but neither attacks would incur damage against mobs. both attacks would still become available after the recycle time, and i also noticed that braw/dimach would appear over head in a dull yellow/brown/gold color...even tho no actual damage was done.

after awhile, i was able to buy a better pistol, and lo and behold! all my special attacks were now incurring damage! and the brawl/dimach word above my head was then the appropriate green color. 

then, i was given the adv only bbi pistol(it rocks!), but now i am back to brawl/dimach having no effect again. they still need a recycle time and the words still appear overhead, but no damage! 

please help! my adv cannot hit for much damage, so i need every hit!

thanks!

Merkreus @ 4/3/2002 6:07:13 AM (18317):
Same thing, funny thing is, it started later in the day and I have been playing all day.  I was on with my main and was zoning into the basic store in athens when it locked up.  Had to use alt f4.  Happened with my other chars as well.  Didnt seem to effect everyone but I do know it effected many folks.  Was also able to un freeze my char but couldnt sit down and within 1 min, it locked up again.  Needless to say, if this continues, it might be time to look at other games

megaram @ 4/3/2002 6:36:46 AM (18314):
now it happened when i came out of whompa from trade to omni ent..

someone read this and fix!!!

severe game stopper, especially in missions, and i bet even worse if hunting.

Team members have a tendency to turn invisible to some/all others after some time when in a mission area / dungeon.

2 known workarounds :

1) Move 3 rooms away and come back
2) Zone

I was talking about a server-reset, because I almost always return with a possé ready and waiting for my timely return. What I was adding to the discussion was that when I tried to make a run for it, and IF I actually made it as far as to the exit, that the door/exit didn't allow me to zone out. As if the key didn't fit anymore or wasn't valid. 
What I'm praying for is that I just had a general LD, which by the way, hasn't occured so frequently these past few weeks 

But.. I suppose this is old news by now

FireC @ 4/3/2002 2:56:03 PM (17292):
This has happened to me to many times as well but am I the only one who's also actually lost pets for this bug? It manifests it self different ways - sometimes I can tab one but I can not see it or get it to report, sometimes I can not see one or tab it but I can get it to report (and the report tells me it's where my other pet is as well, which would be right next to me). It's very annoying and time wasting.

Poweredge|vault @ 4/3/2002 3:04:27 PM (14710):
Badda-bump

Happened to my housemate the other night... bada$$ mob whacked him, just because he was unlucky enough to be the first person back in the team after a crash.

What's worse still is that the mission sync problem is getting severe. I've had several occasions where the mob has stayed standing for more than 1 minute. Not only does it have the nerve to hit me, but for some reason I take shield damage from the mobs also.

spaztic @ 4/3/2002 3:33:52 PM (Dead MOBs still thumping on me?? 18363):
OK, now in the past few days in missions several of the mobs will technicaly be DEAD. my attack buttom goes grey the mob is still smacking me for damage. I can't retarget the dead mob for obvious reasons. but if i step away form it, or move out of line of sight. it fallows me real slowly. and eventually dies (sometimes roaming around for over 60 seconds). what the hell is with that? last night I was nearly killed by a dead mob. this is getting out of hand!

Merkreus @ 4/3/2002 5:06:02 PM (18317):
Ummm, yes I do Miriandel  but I do believe it is you that should carefully read these posts.  You talk about still being able to chat.  We are talking not able to use keyboard functions at all.  There is a big difference as this isnt a lag isue nor is it a slight disabling of your avatar.  You are completely locked up, cannot move, cannot chat, cant use any functions that require keyboard input.  Hence, your only recourse is to use alt f4 in order to get out of the game.

And BTW,  logged in just now and FunCom is taking down the servers for 30 mins.  If this was a lag issue,  servers wouldnt be coming down.

Poweredge|vault @ 4/3/2002 5:12:14 PM (Severe Zoning Issues Everywhere 18377):
Ok, I log in. I usually log out in the shop each evening, so I appear in the shop. A good start.

Head out the door, and pick up people on the scanner just outside HR8 in Trade, then the fun begins. I go to the bank, and it won't let me open my bank. Try the save terminal, same thing... nothing.

So I fly to the grid, in the theory that I may be able to go somewhere quiter. Get to the grid, and my bank window opens, and stays open. Odd. I click the grid. Nothing. Crash.

I wait for my char to log out properly and log back in. I'm in the grid. I move toward the teleport to the next floor, but it won't let me go up. Move around a little, then decide to beat the game to it, and I /quit. Wait a while for the logout, then try again.

Try to log in four times... no luck. It just sits at the AO logo screen, no music nothing, then crashes out totally.

This seems to be happening more and more since the last patch, and along with the horrific mission sync problem it's doing my proverbial tit in.

At the moment, I'm going through the fifth... now sixth attempt to get back in, but AO's server don't want to talk to me. Oh... now I'm on the little teleporter pad, no quick bar icons, no movement, nothing... I may actually call this "progress".... nope. Crashed back to DT.

Ahhh... an explaination. Posted at 15:59:48 that servers will be down at 4pm GMT (now 17:13 GMT). This message appeared at roughly between 17:08 and 17:13 first of all, and through the lack of any proxy at any point throughout my connection, this means that the upload of any status message wasn't until after the fact. Very helpful..

Firstly FC. When things go wrong, post up a message that work is to take place PRIOR to it happening. Secondly, if you are going to work on the server at 4pm GMT, then stop the possibility of logging in under the times that you state. For all I know, my char could be lost in the wilderness, black-holed, god-knows-what, due to the fact that I could log in at least 4:10pm GMT.

Just in case you are wondering all you UK'ers. GMT and BST means that 5pm BST = 4pm GMT.

Come on FC.... GET SHARP! :/

Dyspare @ 4/3/2002 5:13:38 PM (18377):
Just got an ingame message they they're taking the servers down on RK2 for 30 minutes. I'm hoping it's to fix the zoning problem. We should be able to check in 4 hours. /me grins.

your not supposed to be able to dual weild them together. Its a bug.  (ie your not spending the ip in dual weild that you are supposed to because of a bug)

WhistlinJoe @ 4/3/2002 6:28:50 PM (18317):

Jeamus @ 4/3/2002 6:56:15 PM (18262):
I have had the no exp. mob problem as well.  Only for me, it seems to often happen when I use my AoE nanos.  If I have 3 mobs I usually will only get exp. credit for 2 of them if the AoE is the killing blow.  However I am still able to loot all three.  The strange thing is if I use the AoE and then finish the mobs off with a DD or weapons damage I get exp from all three.

YolandaVI @ 4/3/2002 8:16:56 PM (18317):
Time is 21:15 CET and everthing is still Fubar.

Graxxus @ 4/3/2002 8:34:51 PM (18317):
Yep same thing has been happening to me.  I got stuck in broken shores and couldn't move let alone sit down and log out so i just minimized AO and just ctrl alt del. I logged for the night because of that.  Was playing earlier today and the same thing happened every time I attempted to grid into galway. Ended up having to ctrl alt del again.  Relogged and after waiting 2 min...no joke... I was finally able to type but I couldn't sit down. Tried gridding and it didn't work so I tried sitting down ...nothing.  I finally get discoed I reboot and relog in.  Now I'm in the grid again sitting down.  Arrrghhh.  Try gridding out to galway again out of synch again...what a surprise.  Relog and I'm finally in synch.  Its frustrating when ya spend about half an hour just trying to get the game to work properly.

Charlie @ 4/3/2002 8:41:15 PM (18317):
This has been happening now to me for about 2-3 days now. Same problem. Sometimes might see others chat, people moving and I freeze up and cant type or move. Other times my things are mission just like the others said. I am sooo aggravated it isn't worth the aggravation. This isn't just a 3 or 4 time accurance either it is happening quite regularily. The only way to fix it is to restart and sometimes I have to do that a couple of times.  I have waited up to 5 MINUTES thinking it would go away but to no avail.
PLEASE FIX THIS
PLEASE REPLY

Merkreus @ 4/3/2002 9:05:18 PM (18317):
Well, an update for everyone as I received an answer from a GM finally.

GM stated that they(FunCom) are aware of the problem and that it is happening to alot of folks.  They dont know what the problem is but are working on a patch to fix the problem.  They are very sorry for any problems that this might have on everyone.

Now, my 2 cents

Ive played Eq for 3 years.  I know about crappy customer service and patches or buggy code put in place.  Something was added since this has just started happening within a few days.  At present, playing AO is next to impossible since even if you do get out of the zone bug loop(GM words again), your char is so out of sync that you still cant play properly.

Just wanted to let everyone know what Ive found out

Oh good, so this means it should be fixed sometime after 14.2 patch rolls in.

Schnulle @ 4/3/2002 9:35:01 PM (18317):
same thing here.

I did a petition and an ark show uped quite soon. He/She said that it is a known problem and even some arks have that problem . Dev Team is working on a fix ...

Lets see how long it takes

Isaah @ 4/3/2002 9:36:09 PM (18262):
I don't have an AoE nanos so I don't come across that aspect of it, my damage comes primarily from pets. I wonder if it is some kind of bug counting our 'secondary' damage as NPC damage or something...

Valis @ 4/3/2002 9:45:38 PM (18262):
Well from my experience with this, I think if the killing damage comes from an unassociated source, DoT or DS, then since the PC didn't deliver the killing blow, no xp is awarded, but I can still loot.  I notice that this happens most often with Doctor mobs if I kill them as they are casting.  Since I don't know a lot about Dr.  DoTs and nano's, is there one that might reduce the casters HP to do damage? or convert to nano?  Anyway I think it is just a case of the final blow coming from a source that is not directly tied to PC damage dealing.

Dyspare @ 4/3/2002 9:45:42 PM (18317):
Now that's funny.

I can just imagine the arks having to go through the same **** a lot of us have in the past three days. That really tickles my funny bone.

Now if it could only happen to a dev, then maybe it would be fixed posthaste.

Valis @ 4/3/2002 10:01:47 PM (17991):
This is a side effect of the zombie mobs.  I noticed the longer it takes for a mob to die after getting the mob died msg, the more shots you will get on the first attack on the next mob.   Also contrary to what someone else posted, it looks to me that all the damage done counts.   I have actually gone and added up the damage done on mobs and can say that the damage done on the initial extra shots does count.  I tend to figure out how many HP different conning mob types have.  If you zone it will clear any acumulated shots.   Now this is not to say that part of the zombie issue is that these shots are not being counted on the server side, but I don't think so.

Taldrin @ 4/3/2002 10:18:22 PM (17991):
This was happening looong before zombies first appeared, it has nothing to do with them at all.

NiGHTS @ 4/3/2002 10:39:47 PM (keyboard bugs out on me... 18433):
Keyboard Bug?:

I recently went through my first bug experience with AO. Yesterday, I zoned in Omni Entertainment to do a mission. All of a sudden the keyboard stops working. I try restarting my computer, and it works a bit, so I move to Omni Trade. It happens again. Now, whenever I zone the keyboard stops working and I have to try relogging. Even that isn't 100% sure. Sometimes relogging will work, sometimes it won't. Has this happened to anyone else?

NiGHTS @ 4/3/2002 10:49:15 PM (18433):
I'm going to try reinstalling the game. Wish me luck!

NiGHTS @ 4/4/2002 12:01:23 AM (18433):

Firemaker @ 4/4/2002 1:33:02 AM (What is this for crap! 18453):
I bought this game like 2 mounth after the release, and WOW what a game! was playing it day and night!! Under my time here it have been wery mucho buggs, server probls.. bad lagg...

I tought that I coudl live with it because it was a new game and muliplayer games have buggs and stuff like that. But time went on and I got more and more Pissed Off!!  Did get to my lvl 128 and att this time lvl 128 was big. Was in BS and did missions. Every one that know BS knows that is is HUGE lagg and the LD is around the corner.

Come to a time when I got tired of it and I stoped playing it more and more often and then desided to take a break from AO. I was gone 4 mounth. One day I deside to pay and play again because I thougt funcom had fix most of the problems. but but but, 30 min later I was a LD. The laggin Is not better and after one  weak now playing I dunno how manny LD, Server crashes I have been in to. 

Plz funcom. You have to fix this LD and Lagg problems. I have a High end comp (GeForce 4) 1 gig ram ...... and so on, Im sitting on a Fibre Optic 10MBit Line!! 

If something donte happen soon I know manny high lvl that I have been playing with from the start will cancel theres account and that includes me.

This needs to be fixed.... can't play for 5 min before losing sync and then nothing working ..i zone and gotta wait 5-10 minutes before it fixes itself... this includes relogging and even trying to wait it out. The issue is not affected by relogging. The server is for some reason seriouly backed up and you simply gotta wait.

Well, here are the answers i've got from the support :

---------------------

I can understand the frustration. Problem is he is right. There is a
total unbendable no reimbursal policy. I am just hoping we catch
something in the logs to help you out. The dev team knows that some
people lose there stuff on crash and are working to remedy it.

-------------------

I will see if operations can help you. I have to warn you we do have a
no reimbursal policy currently, so if the logs do not pick it up, there
is nothing we can do. Hopefully operations will be able to get to the
bottom of it.

DArgh!  This happens to me too... happened twice in a row tonight, while zoning through 2 zones...

Does anyone know if the "lost" IP goes back into your allocatable IP pool?  Or do we just lose it forever... That would be say...

mulps1 @ 4/4/2002 11:19:27 AM (17346):
hmm i was thinking it maybe implant related as if they lost points somehow as it only happened after i but in my 90's too.  

i will check to see if my base stats plus what implants say adds up to the total i have when i put them back in, then keep track of points i add as i don't really want to take 'em out every time it happens <shudders at the though>, then will see if it is base points or implant related. 

<crosses fingers it is the latter>

maybe some of you guys could do the same as an ip leak would be a nasty bug

There is no difference: it's a  connectivity problem.
Your client may lock up when the AO logo displays, or a bit later when the town's textures are loading, or a bit later when you are finally free to move and use your mouse.


The problem is the servers lose connection with you.
Their whole engine is bugged, we'll never get out of that crap, my 2c

I would think that if the items could have been put into the players main inventory then the Overflow window wouldn't have appeared.  So some player intervention is required.

Drabin @ 4/4/2002 4:38:02 PM (17346):
The reason this happens is you are training your skills while you are buffed with an ability enhancement.  Most of these issues happen when you have INT/PSY/STR/STA/AGI/SEN or Iron Circle, Feline Grace, Enhanced Senses, Any type of Essence, etc. buffed on you when you train.

When any of those buffs disappear the point totals will go down by a point or two or even three.

If you think very hard about it, you will find that you had a similar type of buff on when you trained initially.

The reason why zoning fixes part of this problem if you are having a different type of incident (it even works with your health and nano) is that when you zone the server checks the client for the correct amount and then fixes the correction visually on your screen.

Nietya @ 4/4/2002 9:53:28 PM (10016):
This is positively absurd.

Not true.
 I had this same thing happon to me. I had the exact minimum IP of treatment & first aid to use med packs and stims. I had just logged on (I had logged off with 1/2 health) so while sitting I tried to heal up. I got the message that my skill had to be XXX to ise this item. 
*shrugs* 
so i check my skill I have lost 1 point in both first-aid & treatment. luckely I had extra IP to spair. so i put 1 back into each. I had no buffs running nor' any defuffs on. I had zero nanos active. 

Now wait the story getts better.....
After collecting a few missions & completeing them I gained a level. so I check my skills to see what to do....and low & behold I now have 1 IP extra in both treatment & first-aid.

Xoch @ 4/4/2002 10:34:27 PM (17292):
Happened to me and a friend only one time in a mission a couple of weeks ago. It was solved when I relogged and I think I posted a bug report for it.

Thyrra @ 4/4/2002 10:42:16 PM (17346):
nice reasonalbe explanation drabin.  too bad nice and reasonable doesn't work in ao.  it has happened to me when i spent ip with and without buffs on.

this has been happening to me since release.  i notice it periodically on skills that are near the req to use some item.  it sucks finding this bug in the middle of a battle.

YolandaVI @ 4/4/2002 11:21:45 PM (18317):
I played some AO at work today. Worked fine no zonening problems at all. Keyboard working fine.

When i got home, hoped for the best, started AO
ended up with a ping above 188.000 ms. (hmmmm, that's a long time?), dead keyboard, no map in Ent. and no choosen profession
if you click the skill button and so on.


After several tries, kicked every time with an average ping of 20 sec i decided to reinstall AO. What keept me from doing it is all the 44MB patches.

It's working for me know, no problems accept for the usual ones.

What i've done prior to all these problems are
installing the new Nvidia drivers and Lucas Art's Jedi Play Star Wars Jedi Knight II Jedi Outcast.

----
Try reinstall, dont repair. Uninstall and remove all
files left over from the uninstaller by your self.

If your lucky, it will work.

Taking the patches through FTP is alot more faster than the autopathcer.

...and probably will still be happening six months from now.

workaround is, as has been mentioned, run far away and then come back.  just make sure you run far away down *known* corridors

Not true!!  The ONLY buffs I have on during "training" are never for stats such as INT, PSY, AGIL, etc.  So, I always have my "shotgun proficiency" (for my lower character) on.  100% of the time that I'm playing I have this buff on.  If it wears off, I cast it again immediately.  Other than that, I keep absolutely NO other buffs that affect my stats on, the only ones I have going are AC buffs and deflection shields (minor combat barrier, etc.).

Im really tired to die so much because of pets sometimes run off out of room. 
I understand that the pet is trying to get to my atackers and that there are sometimes bugs on pathing in most games even online games. Heck even EQ had their problem like this before ..though not as bad and was used as exploits ...
back to main issues...Funcom Please Please Please fix this pathing problem. I know  you may be busy with other issues but at least let us know that you're working on this and dont put it out aside as not-so-important issues. 

Let see. In AO there are ...3 classes that use pets?...Though i havent played other classes much but i know eng really dependant on their robot 80% of times since our other combat skills and defense skills suck as dodges or weapon skills can't match the dmg to mobs at higher lv due to lack of ip investment in those area. I dont know how many eng out there increase their combat abilit and try to make them fight as a soldier or enforcer but i want to believe that most eng will want to invest on the 2 prime attribute MatCre and TimeSpace to get much better pet and red  ones. so this shows how eng majority will depend on the pets

You're description toward the proffesion also stated that we, Eng creates robots to do the hardwork or dirtywork...so the biggest problem for eng profession is pathing.

Whoa hillbilly.  Keep your spurs on and tighten up the reigns a bit.   What I stated was what has happened to me in multiple forms many times.  If you checked what I said and it didn't pertain to you then IT DIDN"T PERTAIN TO YOU.  

I don't assume anyone is stupid because stupid is as stupid does.  You cleared that up for yourself partner.

Next time you want to vent some steam try rationalizing instead of berating and keep that big boat hat on top of your metalic iron head.

Sael @ 4/5/2002 9:39:27 AM (Possible EXPLOIT 18628):
Yes I thought that would catch your eyes.

I did report this bug about 6 months ago before I quit the first time.

I have encountered a bug that allows the wrong person to control ones pet. Unfortunately I have not been able to isolate exactly what causes it but the symptoms simply are that the commands you send to your pet, somehow starts controlling someone elses pet, or viceversa.

It seems both people involved need to have a pet going in order for the bug to appear.
This has happened to me numerous times so I am certain that the bug exist and is not simply a figment of my imagination.

Some examples of situations where it occured:

Me (engineer) and a friend (also engineer) was hunting out in the wild. We were grouped.
We both renamed our pets to silly names to easilly tell them apart. We stood there chatting for a while and I´m getting kinda bored so I give my pet the /hunt command.
My pet does absolutely nothing.. just stands there, my friends pet on the other hand goes hunting, and he cant control it anymore. And this was easilly verifyable since we were sitting in the same room, and we know each other irl. From that point on I had a pet not obeying me, however still guarding me with the /guard command on, and an extra pet under my control, his pet.

another example..

I am sitting down using some treatment kits and nanorechargers. An mp spurts by with some monsters chasing him and suddenly my pets goes right after them. My pet kills the monsters and the mp comes over thanking me cause I saved his life.. the problem is, I never even had the time to react, the pet went by itself and I never gave it the order. And even better, the pet kept following him from that point on, and obeying his orders.

This bug keep popping up every now and then and from a programmers point of view I think its a pointerbug. Somehow a pointer gets misaligned or mangled so that it sometimes get messed up who the owner is. Could be some memcopy or stringcopy operation on something that is exactly the same size of some kind of limit in the game and thereby owerwriting or not writing enough.

Ex:

if (var >= 0) 

is often mistakenly written as 

if (var > 0)

thereby leaving a "logic gap" on exactly 0 where it isn´t clearly defined what is going to happend.

....


Got a suggestion about those meory leaks too..
I know there are some, its eating away memory like crazy when I´m not even doing something.

try using __LINE__ and __FILE__ directive to the precompiler and wrap the malloc and the new command, then put every call to malloc in a table using the __FILE__ and __LINE__ to identify them. Wrap free and delete in a similar manner and let them identify the pointer in the database and delete it there too.
When the program,server or game ends, have it write whatever is left in the table in a textfile. That way you get a textfile with every single little malloc that never gets freed and you even get the file and linenumber they are on. This works GREAT on finding most types of memory leaks. (I assume FunCom use Visual C++, not sure about other compilers but I think they ought to have something similar to __FILE__ and __LINE__ if not the same syntax.)

Greenhawk @ 4/5/2002 6:39:18 PM (17638):
If this were true, Miriandel, wouldn't it harm the next mob, rather than heal it?  Also, if this were merely a sync issue, why would you see it more than once in a single fight (which I have many times)...

spaztic @ 4/5/2002 7:55:45 PM (16674):
this doesn't only happen with pets. it happens with all classes. I see this walking dead thing with at least 25% of the MOBs in mission dungeons. luckily they walk real slowly when chasing you. They allways die evventually eventhough you can't attack them, and their corpse is not usually where you see them fall. sometimes its 2 rooms back from where you came from.

the real bummer is: even though you got the kill message & the XP, you can't sit down to heal. you can only use the stims. because fir some strage reason your being attacked by the corpse & can't use a med pack while fighting....*stupid dead guy*

Oberan @ 4/5/2002 8:49:23 PM (18319):
Heres the deal

Brawl and dimach are dynamically created weapons. like the martial artists fists. Their damage is dependant on skill and not weapon rating. They also have a hidden thing which only allows it to be used with certain weapons

kinda like the fixer special attacks and the bow special attacks etc

my guess is that that gun sets a flag which makes the brawl think your not weilding the specific type of weapon (no weapon is a fist weapon). Somehow this is bypassed when you have a melee weapon with brawl. But i think that having a non melee weapon equipped is disabling the weapons ability to use brawl and dimach

ITs a bug to weild em both at the same time right now anyways. So dont bother too much

And it doesn't seem to matter whether it's cave or office or sewer type maps.

MrBunny @ 4/6/2002 3:39:45 AM (16701):
I havent really had this problem of 7 coming after me, but I have noticed that sometimes, in the main room, mobs will walk in and out of it from the adjacent rooms.

Its not unusual anymore to see, three seasoned enforcers in the main room, and then when your trying to figure out how to approach the situation, a seasoned scout and a seasoned crat walk into the main room from the other rooms.

Funcom you sh!ts, if this is how you wanted it, why do team missions when you need a team just to take the first room in an individual mission. Now it doesnt happen that often, but it happens at the worst times, like the mission item is in a small room, and there are three mobs bunched up in the closet room of the mission.

NightShade @ 4/6/2002 6:35:28 AM (18262):
Did any of you notice this happening anytime before March?  

Because I've been using damage shields since I was on level 6 way back in September and I have never before encountered this problem until the past couple of weeks, where it has happened twice.

MuscularBeaver @ 4/6/2002 8:20:58 AM (MOB health bounces back (lag) 18750):
Another variation on the zombie MOB fighting you after they're dead.

The game gets out of sync.  The next time I attack a MOB, I hit it up to 10-15 times INSTANTLY, and watch the MOB's health bar sink to half or less.  

Now one of two things can happen:

1.  I can keep fighting with the gun.  If so, then I may kill the MOB, but the zombie hits me continually for a minute or two (or even longer) after it's dead.

2.  I do something that causes it to resync (sort of) like cast a nano, I think.  

Then the MOB's health bar jumps up to nearly full.  I assume all my previous hits were cancelled out.  At this point I don't know whether it returned to a fair fight or a fight in the MOB's favor, but it sure seems to go in the MOB's favor because I'm still down on ammo as if I hit the MOB and down on nano points that I used. 

What moron added this bogus sync code in the latest patches?

BrontoCowboy @ 4/6/2002 9:11:48 AM (18750):
I have experience this bug as well...  I hit instantly for enough points to drain the mobs' HP completely, but then all of a suden it just jumps back to full health...  Dang!  Wish I could be Uber like the AO mobs who cheat and exploit their way through the game. lol..

runey @ 4/6/2002 10:14:58 AM (18475):
I crashed to desktop 4 times today in as many hours. It is most definitely not fixed.

Mose @ 4/6/2002 10:51:12 PM (18750):
Zombie mobs are real nice, I had one stay 'alive' for a couple minutes, happily beating my ass as I ran.

Monster health has one cool side effect though, they give more xp when you do kill them. Apparantly mobs that get beat to like -50% then recoup health double in xp when killed. Got a 100K kill in a group last night that way.

But my favorite has become invisible mobs. The ones somewhere on the map hammering on you, but you don't see them at all. Only solution I have found is sending my pet on them and following him as he knows where they are.

Oh, another fav, the new uber strengthed mobs. I stopped to whack a static mob on my way along, only to find he now hit for 5k instead of his previous 1k, and also my gun was doing like 1/4 the damage it normally did. I don't twink, so of course I died. I am not sure if this is a 'fix' for the over-equippping issue, but it screwed all non-twinkers. My Fixer now cannot, I repeat CAN NOT do solo missions at my own damn level! Mob's that are yellow are now hitting for huge amounts and taking little damage, and I am left running and getting NO XP.

FUNCOM, your game is slipping back into new release ****. I suspended my account for 3 monthes not long after release from your bugs, and I honestly think it's almost as bad as it was before. I'm not paying for aggrevation, I'm paying to have fun. Somewhere in the last couple weeks you have made the game into utter ****, fix it.

Fryxx @ 4/7/2002 12:17:29 AM (Door BUG in cave type missions 18811):
I don't think I saw this anywhere else on the board- excuse me if I missed it.

This bug has been around for ages and no one seems to complain about it...

In the indoor cave-type missions, the doors that are actually vines that open like curtains do NOT allow targeting through them. EVEN WHEN THEY ARE WIDE OPEN. This is a serious issue. 

I know the portal engine probably sees them as closed because you're just tweaking the maps, not really opening them. This is pretty and all, but as an NT, the way I stay alive is by targeting a mob before it knows I'm there and hitting it with a 500 point nuke that takes 8 or more seconds. The second I cross the portal (even in sneak mode) the mob becomes aware of my presence, ruining my attack. The sneak attack is the only way to level the playing field enough to win against yellows (sometimes greens) NT's are not physical fighters - we can't just pounce in and start pounding mobs (especially when root in a small room is useless)

As an artist, I appreciate the asthetic value of the doors, but this is hurting the actual FUNCTION of the doors for an effect. 

That's wrong.

MrBunny @ 4/7/2002 5:24:30 AM (Aomd 18823):
Funcom I congratulate you on making the game even less interesting than usual. With an ingenius move on your part, you managed to make it so that AOMD no longer is workable for people who use it. It's absolutely brilliant funcom, because now people who don't use AOMD can sit at the terminal some more and click like trained monkeys for hours on end.

Its not bad enough that your information windows are so freaking small that sometimes the carriage return on the text, creates funky words from other cut off words, or that some missions just don't have a description of the area to look in, or giving mission rewards for ql 1 mort maps, but hey, with the increased lag and the inability to use AOMD, It just means more time for people to stand around the Mission Terminal doing nothing but clicking and running to the next mission.

Come on funcom what would you rather have ? A terminal that just puts together a mission from scratch or a terminal that is a database of red flag missions that must be completed ? Of course that is a rhetorical question considering Funcom's apparent level of creativeness.

I did not pay your monthly fees only to spend 1/10t of my time camping,scrolling,and clicking for mission rewards. At the very least with your genius workforce of norweigans, come up with a substitute for AOMD.

Maybe this is related to the 'network issue' but frankly, many people now DEPEND on aomd to get by, since the mission system loot is 99% crap, even WITH aomd you can blow half an hour trying to get the nano you need.

I would swear (did, verbally, and slammed my fist against the table), but it would just be deleted from this forum, so I won't bother.

Point: This would be the MOST AWESOME F-ING GAME EVER PRODUCED if NOT FOR THE G-DAMNED BUGS!!!

I came back after 6 months away. I left because of the mission bugs. I am cancelling my account now because of the mission bugs. I might still play from time to time, but I am going back to Dark Age of Camelot.

I absolutely hate playing DAoC when it in "night-time" in the game, because it is so hard to see, and so easy to be jumped my mobs you can't see ...

... but at least I'm not losing 3/4 of a level to bugs.

Point: I will not be renewing my account, so don't bother fixing the bugs. I certainly won't waste my time describing them.

nafalnafal @ 4/7/2002 9:42:48 AM (18823):
..bumpo to let FC know they broke a third party program that reduced unnecessary tedium from their half-assed mission generation system..

RandaZ @ 4/7/2002 9:51:50 AM (18823):
I find it funny that you're blaming Funcom for a hack not working.  I love AOMD and think wonders of it's author, but comon'... this is getting silly.  AOMD works by looking for byte strings that seem to be constant in all packets that have to do with mission terminals.  But there's no guarantee that those segments AOMD is picking out have to be constant.  

Cut FC some slack on this one.  This is not their baby..  they don't have to support hacked programs.  They don't have to give us coders the packet documents, etc.  I believe there are other real issues that FC deserves blame for, and that this definately isn't one of them.

With that said, here's what you can do to fix AOMD:

1.  Grab the v14 source code, and open functions.cpp
2.  Look for the lines (at the top of the file)

	Code:
	#define LEN_MDATAID 0x4
static BYTE a_xMissionDataID[LEN_MDATAID] = {0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB, 0xAB};
and replace it with 

	Code:
	#define LEN_MDATAID 0x8
static BYTE a_xMissionDataID[LEN_MDATAID] = {0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x05};
static int MissionDataIDOffset = LEN_MDATAID + 0x4;
3.  In the OnPacket function, approx line 523, you'll see:

	Code:
		for (lLoop = 0; lLoop < AO_MISSION_MAX; lLoop += 1)
	{
		/* Find mission data marker */
		lPos = FindStr(a_xMisData, lDataRem, a_xMissionDataID, LEN_MDATAID);
		if (lPos < 0)
			break;
		a_xMisData += lPos;
		lDataRem -= lPos;
Right after that, add the following:


	Code:
			/* Offset */
		a_xMisData += MissionDataIDOffset;
		lDataRem -= MissionDataIDOffset;

Like the original AOMD, this isn't guaranteed to work 100%.  The replacement byte string I'm checking for now 'seems' to be constant.. but like before, I don't really understand what those bytes may be reserved for so it may change in the future.  

I'm sorry to those that don't have VC++ for not repacking an exe with this, but I think most people would prefer to alter their own source-code than download an unknown exe.

If someone wants to repackage it, by all means do so but like all things on the net, download at your own risk.

P.S. I threw this one together quickly and works both in Rome and Omni-Ent.  So if you find that it doesn't work at a specific terminal somewhere, or specific mission type, please let me know.

nafalnafal @ 4/7/2002 10:07:15 AM (18823):
Tappert,

The issue, to me anyway, is not the fact that they altered what they were sending downstream in a packet, thus rendering a third party program impotent.  The issue to me was that they developed a dreadfully unintuitive mission generator, where finding a specific item/location was incredibly tedious for the average user.  

Of course they don't have to support the program, but to break compatibility with a program which has, time and time again, made up for the horrid design of mission generation, is somewhat bothersome.

Though I do thank you for posting your findings regarding a fix.  Very helpful. 

Cheers.

RandaZ @ 4/7/2002 10:23:56 AM (18823):
Nafal,

Ya, I know where you're coming from.  God knows the UI could have been better.  Anyways, I personally don't like to come down on FC too hard on this one because all third-party coders are technically breaking their EULAs.  

If people complain too much about it, I'm just worried they might decide that they have to "clamp down" on it all and do it internally to avoid being blamed in the future .  Coders are already walking a fine line.

And also considering that their programmers already have a lot to do instead of working on these little programs like AOMD and the chat bots, chances are nothing will come out for quite some time.  

In any case, if something goes (inevitably) wrong with AOMD in the future, I suggest just posting a nice request about it in here.  There's bound to be someone who knows how to fix it lurking about.  Scolding remarks and misplaced blame just pisses off the project team and I think we might all agree that's the last thing we want here.  Peace.

Spacegipsy @ 4/7/2002 1:37:53 PM (18823):
I'd be *very* grateful if someone could post an *.exe of the above solution for AOMD.

when zoning with a biomech cloak on, after you zone, the biomech cloak graphic can no longer be seen, all the armor bonuses are still the same, but you can only see what you have on underneath.

Also Biomech cloaks do not look like "cloaks", they just look like normal armor with pants and all. 

Well ok the last one might not be a bug, but is should be!

Do us a favor.. if you do leave, don't let the door hit you on the way out.


I cannot believe that you are whining because a THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, and a program that borders on a hack/cheat, does not work anymore.  I could be wrong, but I doubt that Funcom's intention was to let us roll missions with no effort at all.

I have an idea.. maybe Funcom can install ATM machines near the banks.. then, you wouldn't have to even do missions.. wait.. or better yet, they can just make everything the shops sell free, and boost the QL levels in the shops to 200.. Yeah.. then we wouldn't have to do any work at all.

You're right... what was Funcom thinking.. They should just let everyone have everything.  Then we can all sit around the Bronto Burger and tell stories.  No need for hunting!

If you're unhappy.. LEAVE.  This forum contains 99% whiners.. and that's all you are.. WHINERS.  

Contrary to the belief on this board, developing and maintaing a game the size of AO is not easy.  Thousands upon thousands of people excercise the software.. No matter how big and long a beta test is, you will NOT find all the bugs.

Grow up, quit whining, and enjoy the game.  If you choose not to, complain in a constructive way. I guarantee that not one is going to take you seriously if all you do insult them all day long.

Sorry bout that, I was pretty miffed when I visited this thread, and I'm tired of being patronized by players.  After all, that's FC's job.   But thanks for the interestingly-put anti-rant post, I'll try to stay in the saddle next time.

I remmber a while back you use to simply be able to delete the Mission Key or Wait for the mission to time out and Log in and you would appear out side the mission.

Not sure if it was a bug or a feature, but i'd sure as hell rather be able to delete the mission key and then relog and be outside the mission.

The Credit for Fixing AOMD goes to Tappert

NOT myself i just simply put the changes though and changed the Version Number and compiled it.

BTW if anyone has a problem with me changing the Version number read the disclaimer

I cannot believe that you are whining because a THIRD PARTY PROGRAM, and a program that borders on a hack/cheat, does not work anymore.  I could be wrong, but I doubt that Funcom's intention was to let us roll missions with no effort at all.

I have an idea.. maybe Funcom can install ATM machines near the banks.. then, you wouldn't have to even do missions.. wait.. or better yet, they can just make everything the shops sell free, and boost the QL levels in the shops to 200.. Yeah.. then we wouldn't have to do any work at all.

You're right... what was Funcom thinking.. They should just let everyone have everything.  Then we can all sit around the Bronto Burger and tell stories.  No need for hunting!

If you're unhappy.. LEAVE.  This forum contains 99% whiners.. and that's all you are.. WHINERS.  

Contrary to the belief on this board, developing and maintaing a game the size of AO is not easy.  Thousands upon thousands of people excercise the software.. No matter how big and long a beta test is, you will NOT find all the bugs.

Grow up, quit whining, and enjoy the game.  If you choose not to, complain in a constructive way. I guarantee that not one is going to take you seriously if all you do insult them all day long.

haha just cause your on a dial up and cant get AOMD working on your own doesnt mean you gotta flame people who want it working. I cant see how your so upset about AOMD except the possible reasons.
1.) You cant get it working cause your on AOL.
2.) Your too dumb to get it working on your own. Which would then go to say, how dumb you really are if you enjoy standing around a terminal clicking on end for hours. But hey if that is your kind of game, I have to say that you could save yourself 12 bucks a month and play pinball. Lol!
3.) Or cause I gave your mom a good f*ck last night. But dont worry I be back later. ^^

and

There is already an AOMD 1.5 a much improved version of Muz's 1.4.

Better menu, support for making it small so you don't have to open and close it all the time. http://homepage.ntlworld.com/chris.wallbank/

Note on versioning for another time, when you fork, change something else than the version number so you don't run into the conflict with the other AOMD 1.5. Fx. AOMD 1.5-Tap (Honoring the hacker) or something similar.

Peggoty @ 4/8/2002 8:16:30 AM (ALT-TABing confuses the health/nano regenerating 18941):
I don't know if this has been documented yet (4 pages of threads get a bit much to read)

It seems that when you are waiting to regen health and nano and you ALT-TAB the game (minizing it) your health and nano regenerate a lot faster.

I tested it out with one doctor character and in about 10 seconds I gained 4 health normally while sitting.  When I ALT-TABed and waited for about 10 seconds before maximizing I found that I had gained 40 health while the game was minimized!

I just tried it 10 mins ago with nano regen and the same thing happends, but not as fast.  It took about 29 seconds for 5 nano points to regen normally.  After minimizing for 29 seconds I only gained 35 nano points.

I thought it was an exploit, but it seems that it's just my client getting confused.  I tried to run nano progs after a supposed "quick nano gain" and it wouldn't let me even though by nano bar had enough points.  Also, with the doctor I noticed my health dropped for no reason after the "quick health gain" about 5-10 minutes after I minimized.  I guess it synced with the servers after a time.

Not a major problem, but if someone's resting in a mission and goes off to check the web for some info and comes back to find an erroneous full health bar...

Oh well, thought you might like to know.

Krneki @ 4/8/2002 8:20:20 AM (18916):
Rule of One is quite nasty, with it's high min and 3.2k max dmg. It doesn't matter what your AC is, it matters what you nano resist is to get hit for lower dmg. One good thing is that Crat mobs have close to zero ac, so they go down a ton faster then anything else.

You forgot the chris wallbank version (Don't remember the url, it's the one which use a text file as a list of watched items to get around the problem with watch in muzzleflash version working only under NT/2000/XP)

Unfortunately, all the people who made enhanced versions of AOMD didn't release their sources, so the only version that has been fixed is the original one.

I think that anyone doing a customized version of AOMD should both: name it something else than AOMD (to avoid to have several different 1.5 versions floating around), and release the damn sources (so that it can be fixed without waiting for their authors to do it when it gets broken)

DaveDread @ 4/8/2002 10:05:48 AM (17346):
I think this has to do with how AO "rounds off" ability bonuses. I've had 1 skill point lost a few times. Made me all nervous, then I calmed down. Next time, try raising an ability affecting that skill by 1 point and see if your Bio Met or whatever pops back up. Example: Ability bonus +12.5 rounded up to +13. When zoning, AO recalculates and rounds +12.5 to +12. 

This seems to work for me:
Increase an ability, point by point, until a particular skill goes up 1 point.
Zone.
Sometimes that skill will lose 1 point.
Add another point to the ability. 
Zone.
The skill will stay at its value.

Just my thoughts.
/DaveDread

Seid @ 4/8/2002 11:23:28 AM (18587):
Common problem in zones with a lot of people.

To get it fixed, log on with an alt and do :

/petition stuck My character XXXX cannot log on in XXXX

When the word "stuck" is the first word in the petition, they are usually quite quick to respond and move you to somewhere you can log in.

Basher Tarr @ 4/8/2002 12:10:15 PM (18941):
Hmm, it would be interessting to test if the hp/nano gain you see is "real" or if its just a visual glitch on the client...

Tyndel @ 4/8/2002 12:50:44 PM (various bugs with mission mobs. 18965):
1: mobs who die in acid/toxic pools sometimes doesnt give xp(they die of the acid i think and the silly game assumes they were killed by an npc)

2: Invisible mobs starts hitting you, and you cant see them.
This is a server/client glitch i guess.. but its DAMN annoying to have a invis mob hitting you, and you cant tab to see it, cant use any specials on it, cant cast nanoformulas on it.  Have died too many times to such mobs now.. FIX IT!

3: mobs dont die when they reach 0% health. they just keep on shooting you.. 

4: mobs with melee weapons have unlimited range.  When you try to run from a melee npc in a mission.. he wont stop hitting you until you zone.. no matter how fast you run, no matter how many rooms you put between you and him.. this is ANNOYING!

5: when you calm the silly mob in a mission, he doesnt stop his current attack, so if you got any type of damage or reflect shield running.. this is what happens: You calm successfully, mob does his last attack.. reflect shield hits mob.. the mob aggs again.
This also happens if the mob is standing in acid or toxic pools, or if the mob casts a nano on himself.

6: mobs seems to hit twice as fast if you move and they cant see you for a second.. I.e if the mob have to run to catch up to you.. they suddenly start to hit at twice the speed as before. This especially happens when the mob gets stuck for a while, i.e client shows the mob trying to run into a wall or something, then the mob shoots/hits 2 hits simultaneusly.

7: line of sight in missions reallly really needs a workover.. a 10 cm high fireplace in the middle of the room really shouldnt be enough to keep you from having a line of sight to a mob. Especially not when the mob is happily shooting at you from the same location

After a mob is apparently dead, no health left and your characters stops attacking, you can still get hit, several times or MORE! Just happend to me the other day with an A500 bot. I have seen this more and more recently. DOnt think its a local issue. Any thoughts....

It started out pretty well... lightinh and shadows was much improved, and performance was not bad at all...

But then things started turning trippy...

Buildings moved...I gained X-Ray vision and could see thru walls now and then... and then, walking towards the grid in West Athen things REALLY started to get freaky...

A part of the building along the street "fell down" and moved around, building walls were shuffling, and the rain turned black !

And no, I was sober, I dont do drugs and didnt have too much caffeine 

So my conclusion is that the game client needs to lay off those illegal substances...and maybe get some debugging

This is a problem with richedit and win98/ME. I had a look at it when I was messing with AOMD and never figured why it doesn't work (you input your watch stuff in the richedit control and AOMD doesn't get it)

It works only under NT, 2000, and XP as far as I know. The AOMD version of chris wallbank (1.5.0.0, don't remember the url) worked around this problem by using a text file for the watch item list. However I don't know if it has been updated with the recent fix...

Amen and amen.  I REALLY hate that, especially when my char dies a few feet from the exit.  There's NO WAY the MOB should have been able to keep hitting me through walls and beyond the range of the weapon (especially when the weapon is a melee weapon like a club and the MOB is 3 rooms away!).

Does anyone know what the difference between the two different 1.5 versions are?  I believe I have the one Miravlix is talking about, think I got it off of AOstratics.

Also, can anyone explain how you use the search functions in AOMD?  I read through the stuff I got when I downloaded it but, it was written like I would already know how.  I know there has to be some way to set up a list of stuff you are looking for in missions because, I get the visual and sound que on some items, although I have not set anything to pick them.

Also, is there a faster way to generate a new mission set than moving the slider bars back and forth to reset the generate missions button?  That retains the position of the sliders I have set?

Merengue @ 4/9/2002 3:51:29 AM (While you are fixing the Biomech Cloaks... 19088):
...don't forget the Omni-Tek armor.  It suffers from the same bug.

It equips initially, but the visual disappears when you zone.  To see it again, you have to unequip and equip it again.  This is annoying.

However!  The Biomech Cloak situation is 100 times more annoying as I had to install 3 implants to get the thing on.

Me before cloak: "Need 400 NP to make 3 implants!"

Me not having enough strength for one of them: "Need 300 NP!"

Me after spending a ton of cash and finally getting the helmet and cloak on: "Hooray!!!!!!"

Me 30 seconds later after walking out of the store: "NOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!"

If I actually want to "see" the cloak, I can't zone after equipping it unless there is an outside surgery boot, and then it will still be a major pain in the rear.

What a let down!  I can't believe this bug has been left for so long.  Why is it scheduled for 14.2?  Why not 14.0?  It's not like it's new.

Cayana @ 4/9/2002 8:20:25 AM (18972):
This has happened to me as well, several times now.  The mob has 0 health, my character stops attacking, but the mob is still standing up and hitting me.

I now one, adress my problems directly to the ARKs that are for me representative of the customer service.

They won't be able to help really, but they are nice people and this way Dev Team will have better stats / logs of the live problems. The forum is a very biased report tool you see. Five persons could endlessly bump something, while it's no important matter.

Live petitions are treated in an entirely different way.

Enno @ 4/9/2002 11:44:06 AM (18852):
It seems that the fact AOMD stopped working was either caused by the hardware changes we did on the site (and AOMD being unable to reorder packets that came out of order) or a fix in our code that stopped a possible exploit in the client-server protocol. 

Either way, as many have on this board have pointed out, we cannot test all third party tools before making changes, nor are we likely to do this in the future. We cannot announce these kinds of changes beforehand either, since they do not affect the client or the people using it in the way it was intended. The additional overhead of checking that for any change we make, no third-party tool will break would be an extra strain on our QA department that they neither see as their obligation, nor have the time to perform. We actually have a policy of not using them, or any other potential trojans inhouse.

That said, the AOMD team and other third-party tool developers should probably test 14.0 before it goes live (it's been on the Test servers for a long time now), and make sure your tools will not unexpectedly break again.

And a final note: We reserve the right to block out any tools that will cause a degradation of the performance of our product. While AOMD doesn't generate a lot of network traffic as of now, generating a lot of missions creates a strain on our CPU resources. We'll be watching the situation.

I've had this happen in office missions, also.  It does seem to mainly happen with doctor humanoids for me, though, although I'm having a difficult time identifying what specifically is causing the problem.  For the most part, the last thing they do before dying is DoT me, so there is still the same type of smaller, more frequent damage than weapon damage element to the phenomena, as is the case with acid.  Whatever is causing this, though, it does need to be fixed.

Orderangel @ 4/9/2002 2:05:09 PM (Actually, v1.5 is a bit drastic. here's the recompile i supplied on the same day. 19143):
Thanx to Tappert's coding i recompiled it and gave it to everyone.

1.5 is a bit drastic. I named it 1.41f because it was just a matter of identify new bits in the mission packets. This is not really an upgrade, just a bug fix.

Otakette @ 4/9/2002 3:30:07 PM (Attacked by friendly guards? 19161):
I'm an omni-aligned engineer.  Went to Lush Hills Resort for a mission, came back out and headed to the insurance term.  The guards decided to attack me for no apparent reason.

My bot was on /pet follow at the time.
I was not in any sort of attack mode, nor had I even targeted anything since leaving the mission.
These same guards (Male and Female sergeants I believe) have always been friendly before, and have been friendly ever since.

In my chat I just got the message of them saying they were tired of me and they attacked.  I did at least make it to hit insure just before they fired, so I didn't loose anything.  It also meant I kept my bot since I popped right back there.  I checked the guards and they liked me just fine as usual.

There's obviously some bug here, but with just my one incident I'm afraid it's not a lot to debug with.  Anything like it happened to anyone else?  If so, please add your experience so the Testing/Dev team has more info to work with

Odaen @ 4/9/2002 4:04:19 PM (18852):
Ok so there are two different 1.5 versions, a 2.0 version and a 3.0 version.  I think 1.5 is a fix for 1.4 to work in Newland.  2.0 has the autobuy feature which sounds great.  Is 3.0 based on 2.0 or 1.4?  If not then whats the difference between 3.0 and 1.5?  Also since 2.0 seems to be based on 1.33, the watch function does not work on Windows ME.  Was wondering if the author of 2.0 can fix it for Windows ME or make the source available.

I just tested AOMD3.0 on test (14.05) and it seems to work. Sometimes it would only register three of the five missions, but generally it worked fine.

Given the immense popularity of AOMD, is there any chance that you guys will take the hint and provide similar mission readouts without the need for a third-party tool?

And while I'm on the subject, please get somebody there to consider promoting Shopbot to level 51. That player-created bot brings shopping in AO up from the 17th century system that is provided in the game.

3.0 does NOT have the autobuy feature (and I'd be surprised if that feature didn't spell the end of aomd, it is pretty obviously the kind of bot that Funcom has said they won't tolerate). It seems in most ways similar to 1.4, a little cleaner. The big added feature is a 'describe' button for each of the missions where you can pull up a screen with the mission description that doesn't require all the scrolling that looking at a mission does. Though the description is only the main text and not the reward.

How did this get on the second page? 


And Epsilon Purge is "supposedly" going to be fixed soon, I wonder if rage will also work as "intended" (i.e. remove COMBAT DEBUFFS not just ROOTS).

This has been going on forever.. 
I have posted this at least once a month for the past 5 months or so and have NEVER recieved acknowledgement from anyone FUncom side.. 

Green mobs was my main issue.. When green mobs and greys for that matter, get below 50%, they start resisting nanos like CRAZY.. i counted 8 resists in a row the other day on a green mob that was at 10% health.. Also my guns fired at least 20 times and never hit once.. Only Fling/Burst would hit, and yes i moved around alot too and still..

This NEVER happens on mobs even con or higher.. I count maybe 1 resist in 50 casts against even con or higher, but against greens and lower, sheesh about 10 nukes out of 15 will be resisted..

I doubt we will get a responce from FUncom.. They just dont even look at these boards much at all..

You're right about the life %.  I failed to mention that in my first post, because I thought that it might have been giving me a false readout.

Serena @ 4/9/2002 7:25:20 PM (18823):
Well you know, I think the solution is this. Since the program is freeware basically the original author has abandoned it and left the source code for anyone to alter at their wim. Funcom should take this program and integrate it into AO endong all issues on the subject.

Serena @ 4/9/2002 7:30:28 PM (18852):
autobuy?

You put the x-y locations for the start, switch, and endpoint for the sliders, then put the x-y for the request mission button.  It then starts purchasing missions until it finds something in the watch field.

I do see how this can eat up bandwidth and cpu cycles, but to make a concession, there can be a timer put on how long it waits to get the next mission.  It would still be a useful tool, even if it takes a little while longer to search for it.

Nietya @ 4/9/2002 8:29:13 PM (18978):
Ah, reality, but does the hardware T&L give you any noticeable improvements?

Anglais @ 4/9/2002 10:23:24 PM (Duplicate Unique items in Chests 19207):
Ok - not as important as, say, IP loss - but there you have it.  Two unique items in a chest have to be checked for.  They both become '?' blobs.  The item resolves itself upon zone/logging, but technically it should happen.

I experienced something like this a while back, Chicano my trader Alt, used mind swap on a reet and I mas messing around having it kill leets... 

well... I headedback to omni ent, from omni forest and when i got to around the playpen, I got some some wierd music and saw the "attacked by  -NONE-" message. I stopped and looked around and saw nothing and my map was clear too. I proceeded to the omni ent entrance... and right away the guard attacked me. Of course at lvl20 or so it was instakill... but after res'n I came back they were nice to me again?!?  

Bug? heck if I know...

Oh yeah, known bug.  At least by players.

Something with pets and them changing their alignment to 'monster'.

Not specific to someone zoning with pet, or not zoning with your pet.

Not specific to a specific pet class.

Not specific to the person even being a pet class (documented case of an enforcer suddenly getting jumped by his own guards...i think there was an MP heal pet on him, tho)

Cayana @ 4/10/2002 5:55:04 AM (19109):
Ya, I most certainly think it is a bug.  If I do 90% of the damage to the mob, I should get the exp, not the toxic waste.

Dyspare @ 4/10/2002 6:00:25 AM (19109):
The important question is, does the acid level? :>

Maybe the toxic waste is doing more damage than we do.  If the mob stands on it for a long time, the toxic waste is actually doing a lot of damage.  Just that the hp regeneration of mobs is high enough to compensate it.

Obergeist @ 4/10/2002 8:26:18 AM (19109):
Nope, pull the mob off the acid, and you'll get exp.

The timer tool is a great idea!  Hehe... go have a cup of coffee, come back, and tada! "Your mission awaits, sir."

Hehe resourse wise i think funcom would rather have the autobuy AOMD then the normal one  I can roll 3-4 missions in the time it the autobuy to roll 1 but then again of course i have to pay attention and on occasion accidently miss the item i was looking for

Seid @ 4/10/2002 9:19:16 AM (18978):
It gave me noticeable improvement in light / shading ( fireplaces etc )

Using reference driver 23.11 on a GF2 MX in Win2K

Too bad it didnt last... maybe I should reinstall the driver or change it.

Downsizr @ 4/10/2002 10:18:14 AM (18978):
I put my GeForce 3 in HAL instead of TAL yesterday and push up the resolution to 1600x1200.

Nice improvement, no loss of performance and the graphics are just slightly duller.

Any feedback on this ?

Doctorkain @ 4/10/2002 12:04:32 PM (16059):
Did you all know that mobs will modify their own AGG/DEF? Ie, if they're green/grey to you, they go uber defensive, and if they're super red they go aggro. That's why red mobs hit you at an insane rate of speed for some unrecognizable reason - they're going full aggro.

I'm wagering those greens are going further Def after 50% hp. Yay FunCom, attempting to purposely drag out fights.

Vydas @ 4/10/2002 4:31:08 PM (19109):
not just the acid.  As I mentioned, I do office missions, virtually exclusively.  There is no acid.  But I still have this problem.

cold @ 4/10/2002 4:47:05 PM (18978):
You bet it does improve performance. Framerate feels twice as smooth (can't check, ctrl-alt-f don't work for me for some reason).

A few patches ago it was reset to non-T&L. I was wondering for a few days why it ran so slow

This time, MKII hood.

I spent a week getting it.
I have every Corona part.
MKI + MKII.


Just now not the hood.

One, whole, ****ing week!
I am very disapointed.
Damn server crashed.
It was in my damn backpack.

I am thinking about leaving becuase of this.
A whole week.
I sent HOURS, ****ING Hours in that place looking for a whole set.



Now I am told by people and a ark that the spawn has been greatly inscreased, so good bye MKII HOOD.

I really did hate helmet and I only got the suit on yesterday.
1 day of fun and happyness.
All gone.
Back to ugy omnipol, nope i refuse to wear it.

I'm splitting as soon as SWG comes out. In the meantime, I'll play AO. But with crap like this, my resolve to keep playing is weakening.

Dyspare @ 4/10/2002 8:19:35 PM (14710):
Well, I'm not sure if this happened to anyone else...but last night, I'm going through a mission, clearing rooms as I go, and I'm at the end of a 6 room series. Straight line, no turn offs, or side rooms. So, I have 6 empty rooms behind me.

I'm in a small room, standing about 3 feet from the doorway, while my bot is beating up the bad guy. Then, out of nowhere, a mob spawns in the room behind me, and roots me, and starts shooting me, of course, not breaking the root.

Bot kills the badguy, turns around, and decides to run into the wall. I sent 30 attack commands, and the damn thing wouldn't side step to the right, 3 feet to attack the mob.

Needless to say, I died. Thankfully I levelled 120k xp earlier, but this isn't the first time this has happened where mobs will spawn/appear behind me, in rooms I know was cleared.

Cosmik @ 4/10/2002 8:24:07 PM (14710):
We are working on this issue as I type this. I know we've gotten a number of reports since the patch about team missions crashing, and am using the information I read here before hand to help. Just in case I missed it, is anyone experiencing this in single missions? (ie you without a team).

Steward @ 4/10/2002 8:52:08 PM (14710):
Thanks for reading & responding cosmik!!

I have had this happen to me several times in single missions.

I haven't played 14.0 yet but I would say it has happened to me off & on ever since 13.90+

The worst is when you're in a big tricky mission, because when you pop up deep in it with no map, there's no chance of finding the door before you get mowed down.

Happened to me twice today.

Once in a new "team" mission.  The entire team got booted and all came back in random rooms.  We all, of course, died.

I agree with a suggestion in another post.  At least bring us back in the first room of the mission.

But Why my MKII hood, My prized peace of armor...ANYTHING but the hood! I am even willing to swap a sleeve for this hood 

Okay I only lose what 60hp and 3 NCU but I LIKE THEY WAY THE HOOD LOOKS.

Now Im toally refusing to wear anythinh except shades or Social Hoods that look almost the same 

This is coming from a Person who can never get special Items, Never get to do quests or see specials people.
A person who sees people get every single item and more.

I have spent the last 5 hours attempting to log into AO. My char just sits there with 'transfer' stated in the credits, inv is empty etc.., exact same issue with all my charecters.

Problems started this morning, where I experienced an untold number of crashes when I tried to zone, from the Grid, to Tir, Athen, Bliss - I was stuck in a mission entrance for about 2 hours.

Is it just me or are there other prople also having problems ?

(In fact it tooks me about 3 hours attempting to get onto the forums, just to log this). I know the problem is not at my end, as I have a laptop also connected to the Internet over the same line and I'm not having any other connectivity problems, only problems with the AO sites.

Please help....

I can recreate a crash at will, just login, wait (about 1 minutes) and it will crash, I now cant get pass the 'AO is loading' screen.

What ever change you made FC, you had best undo it.

I've never had a problem in the past and I could never understand plp complaining in the forums, but now I'm victim of this madness.

Complete and utter madness and is totally unnecessary.

(I've also just tried to download the latest patch for my laptop, 12 hours ! for the download - FC I think you are having some serious problems there) - Please advise with an update to what is going on an a ET for a resolve.

Seid @ 4/11/2002 2:19:57 PM (Appetizer Glass x 65535 19711):

Almost every one I know is having this problem now, before this patch it was a bit more rare but now some of my characters just can't be logged in at all.

JLucy @ 4/11/2002 2:25:16 PM (19699):
I'm glad to hear that - I know I'm not loosing my mind.

I dont understand why it's taken FC 6 hours to figure out there is a problem.

Seid @ 4/11/2002 2:34:32 PM (19159):
Yep. But Wastelayer Beetles and Torrith the Ancient are much bigger bugs

Darkbane @ 4/11/2002 2:36:26 PM (14710):
Yep, ran one solo mission last night and got twice the loot and twice the xp thanks to 2 resets. Noticed that the token counter doesn't get reset if the mission does so was at 100% long before clearing the mission (again). That's probably for the best, mind you...

[EDIT: And somewhat offtopic, as the item in a find or return mission can now spawn anywhere a chest does, do check the 'secret' rooms...]

Seid @ 4/11/2002 2:36:55 PM (19692):
Sure there are. You are confusing them with spoons.

Oberan @ 4/11/2002 3:47:00 PM (19711):
probably some kind of anti bug code.

I doubt you were supposed to get 65k glasses because that would be massive credits. There was a bug with buying from vendors on test that did that before too. They probably implemented the inability to do that to prevent bugs.

Not like your missing much with glasses though

Oberan @ 4/11/2002 4:49:24 PM (Several Bugs & Stuff on live 19756):
Good thing about cut and paste. My login timed out between the time i started the post and finished writing it

1.
DeCranum's Corona MK II: Gloves
http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?&cmd=view&id=157765
and
DeCranum's Corona MK II: Pants
http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?&cmd=view&id=157764

Have no energy AC but rather have 2 melee AC entries. Rather nice for melee AC but its a bug non the less

2.
Deimos' Bio-Enhanced Feedback Rifle
http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?&cmd=view&id=153981

Checks verses the opponents Assault rifle skill and not projectile AC. Very unfair for non assault rifle professions because it doesn't matter how high your evades are


3. Title level requirement items
Any Bracer ring etc above level 180ish require title level 6 (ie 190) to use. The required title level to use should match the title level equivlent of the items quality

4.  Reflect bracers not working properly against all damage
This is a weird one. I have a 13% reflect bracer (max reflected damage 13) and used a 13% soldier reflect shield kill (max reflected damage +7). I attacked a frightened rollerrat and i got 2 different reflect damage values. Rollerrats do 2 melee attacks. Note that both attacks deal about 350 damage per a hit. HOWEVER. the first attack said reflected 7 points of damage the 2nd attack said reflected 20. It seems as though the first attack did not take into account my bracers reflect bonus but the 2nd did.

5. Zoning with parrot. No this is not the smugs den thing. I wear a full set of mk2 armor as well as a 700hp token board. Whenever i zone from an outdoor to an indoor zone when parrot drops my hit points go from about 6100 to about 4500. It seems that the hp from my equipped non implant items is being subtracted from my maximum when the 250 points from parrot is returned to my maximum hp (status is its annoying but not fatal with my amount of hp)

6. Unable to land in pit lizard (its a big bug and pit lizard is our class defining nano as an adventurer. Yet noone wants it because outdoors its useless (and PLEASE allow us to fit through whoompas again if you arent flying (tested by having it cast on me when i was sitting which negated the flying aspect)

7. Damage shields in morphs. Simply put they blind you when in a morph. In normal form your head does not have a damage shield visual effect on it but in a morph it does (very annoying)

8. Show other effects and blinds. If you turn off show other effects blind nanos do not effect your visual abilities.

9. Doctor npcs chain complete healing. Not really a bug but i dont know how the doctor npc manages to cast a 1200 nano point nano about 8-10 times in a fight and amazingly still have enough nano to cast wrack & ruin as well as a huge init debuff (mind you this complete heal is instant as well)

10. Damage shields not working verses dot's and nanos. This was reported about 8 months ago when it was broken but it still hasn't been fixed. Dot's already do 400 to 500 points a tick and doctor ones are stackable. Yet this measly bonus still hasn't been fixed.

11. Moving can interrupt nanos cast upon you. Basically if you are moving proc effects can be interrupted (like blinds from traps). Also you have a chance to have things like stuns when you brawl from hits on opponents at certain times (also effects group heals/buffs)

12. Flowers pants do not have the correct fire ac (or was it cold) for all other flowers peices they are equal except flowers pants have lower fire ac.

13. The assault rifle skill states its for non energy weapons. However there are several weapons that require both ranged energy weapons AND assault rifle (which should not be possible)

14. Melee weapons that are heavier than riders do not require heavy weapons but riders do.

15. Using a Da Taunter! when not an atrox yields the message "Target must be Athrox" (didn't check post patch and no thats not a typo on my part)

16. Floating torches do not add any extra light when you use a morph.

17. Special items such as flurry of blows do not give a message when they wear off (they really should). In addition feedback when changing chat channels would be really nice

18. Grey engineers/mps with red conning pets (come on this has GOT to be a bug!!!)

19. First aid kits at various levels showing improper tags in shops (example is the q80 first aid kits in shops show themselves as unique, no drop and quality level special before you buy them)

20. Unable to stack treatment kits or nano chargers. 

21. Reet forms will not take hold on any player with an evade buff even if the evade buff is a lower level. It does not give the message better nanoprogram running. It takes nano and says successfull but no effect. In addition they will sometimes cast on people without the right amount of ncu free and get the same result.

22. Dark cave missions. Cave missions since the fix to help npc pathing (ie removal of slime pits etc) have become insanely dark in some areas) my video card displays dark and without a gamma or brightness ability in game some rooms are literally pitch black (i could adjust it outside of the game but then my windows looks strange outside the game (washed out colors etc)

23. Since 14.0 the numbers ingame are blocky. for instance on my shortcut bar i can barely read the count on the number of treatment kits i have left.

24.  No purchasable map of broken shores or holes in the wall (bet the gm's have em though)

25. Bugged npcs with flagged uber stats at insufficient level. Like the grey omni npc in wartorn valley (brjorn krax or something) cons grey but hits for 6k

26. Mobs spawning behind zone walls. (happens in wartorn valley to nuts & bolts and several others)

27. Ma fist damage nanos changing damage type of ma weapons too. (for instance you will get swords doing fire damage etc)

28. symbiographs/nano fingers/blister packs with general nanos on them. I mean seriously why would anyone want these? to lock a nano skill for an hour to cast a nano that costs 55 nano at level 180 is pathatic

29. invisible walls in tir. Since the barriers were added around the arena. Hidden invisible barriers have also appeared over many of the walls in tir. These walls make jumping over the walls impossible (because the walls go up to 225 z height.)

30. npc's casting nanos WAY above their level. Like those level 180 traders who cast a nano requiring 874 skill without first casting a lesser ransack. There is no way for them to have that much nano skill whatsoever at that level due to them having blue skills. Even with 200 implants without first casting a lesser nano its impossible. (not going to even get started on their nanos taking effect before they actually cast it)

Granted all these bugs and things are from my perspective as an adventurer. Some might be features or game balance issues. However several are definately bugs

Jinya @ 4/11/2002 5:31:24 PM (19756):
Grey MPs and Engineers having red pets isn't really a bug, with Mochams or Infuses, it's possible for a level 120ish MP to cast their final pet (cacodemon I think) and since Infuse and Mochams are castable on others, they can get engineers in pets a lot higher than normal.

While the first 1 or 2 we're an interesting novelty, I have found noone in game that wants to do team missions when they are looking for pure xp. Teams are turning back to doing solo missions with 6 team members instead, which aren't supposed to be any different than before the patch. 

I don't mind that, but the problem is I belong to a pet class and if there is a pet on the team, the mission behaves just like a team mission without the levels or the boss. 

I can't even do solo missions like they worked before cause of the super agg. I walk in the door...then half way across the first room i am attacked by 5 or 6 MOBs. 

So I can't solo and I won't even try to join a team 'cause I just screw things up for them. 

I am very sad...I don't want to leave this game...I like it, I thought things were getting better...i just can't believe this...I am very very sad... 

p.s. to the teams that I worked with the last to nights that got absolutely nowhere 'cause me and my pet were there, I apoligize. I just didn't know.

This has been going on forever. I have tried all the things I could think of this far to make them stay (saving, using them all, relogging etc.) but nothing works. It's also so random how they disappear, sometimes all go, sometimes only a few, sometimes all stay. I've even had some macros I have had for a while suddenly just not be there.

Same later in a QL136 team mission, we had Detain Suspect, Biotoxin MKI and Infected Wounds cast on various team members. These are level 30 or lower nanos being cast by Level 130+ MOBs.

Hmmm.....what gives there?

I think those are zone lines, not very realistic but they make it possible to have the map an easy square shape... I think that's one of the reasons for them. If you get the Omni skin from the http://www.kuren.org/ao that has the other map, *not* the Helpbot's map, you can see where the zonelines go easily when in the game as that one has them drawn on to it.

Yes yes, but did you actually read what post I replyed to? There is a difference between zone lines and those nasty little invisible things that appeared after the last patch, the person who I replyed to was quite clearly talking about zone lines.

Still just bumping thread!

Just that it is bad bad bad!You can barely stick your head into one doorway in a singleplayer mission (grouped with one other person) without half the mission aggroing you.Also another new one is zoning into first room of mission and getting 4 to 5 mobs aggro from first room and joining rooms.

I had auto-run on, and stopped several times tonight for no reason, running in place...

Zone border?  I sure hope not!  I was running between the newb shop and the less-newbie-more-uber shop in West Athens.  I sure hope they didn't put a zone between those two areas!!! lol 

As for coords, I don't remember, but it was just past the bank, and I remember that it was *exactly* where the ground texture changed from brick to grass.  I noticed I wasn't moving, yet I was running in place.  Yep, the game was animating me as running, yet I was going nowhere.  Didn't ever have this problem before the 14.0 patch.  Also, this happened at another place in/near town, but don't remember the other place, as I had thought it was lag at the time.  But, when I stopped in W. Athens, there was no lag.

Don't forget - aggro through zones!!  Yes that's right, and next we'll be upgraded to:  aggro through dimensions!  Yeah, then that level 180 can gank you all the way from rk1 lol! 

If monsters are gonna warp through the whole mission, then why shouldn't they be under the same runspeed rules as we are?  If they're all the way across the mission, even if walls are no impedence to them, shouldn't it at least take them a minute or two to reach the team?

BrontoCowboy @ 4/14/2002 9:04:34 AM (19855):
Okay, instead of just posting about it I decided to go back to the very same spot, and the wall was still there.  It occurs *exactly* along the border between the brick texture and the grass texture, so perhaps it has something to do with how textures are handled?  I don't know...  Anyway, the exact coords in W. Athens by the bank between the shops is:

Pos 396.1, 388.5 PF 545

This occurs from the wall of the shops to the edge of the texture border approacing the city wall.  (I'll also email a bug report on this.)  If you're in W. Athens try it out, it's really weird!!  Also, there are at least 2 "holes" where you can get through along that area...

Edit:  Bug report submitted w/screenshots of the area.

Update:  I did a little testing - after another log, it was still there, but I found that when I got stuck behind the wall, it was low enough to jump over...

BrontoCowboy @ 4/14/2002 9:41:24 AM (19855):
2nd invisible wall found in W. Athens near the first one:  Pos 396.1, 420.2 PF 545.  This one is near a column.  In the first instance, it only stops you if you're heading w., not the other way around - it appears to be a "one-way" invisible wall...

Edit:  3rd invisible wall found in W. Athens @ 312.0, 427.3 near the mountain next to the last shop, while heading east.

4th invisible wall found in W. Athens @ 343.2, 415.3 near a wall, while heading east.

The post I replied to talked about long invisible walls in the places where there is known zone lines, ok? Understood? Completely different from the ones you (and I and about everyone else) have encountered in the cities.

Jypsie @ 4/14/2002 8:45:48 PM (19932):
Yeah, everyone is staying quiet because they like this bug 

1st time I noticed, was when a Doc threw a dinky little dot on me, and my damage shield absorbs poison. Absorbtion usualy gets knocked off so fast I never notice it, but I kept seeing "You absorb 5 pts of poison damage" Was wondering what the heck was going on, then realized that the 100+ doc just thew a newbie dot on me.

Later on I got a good laugh when I came up on a advent mob, whose damage shields usually tear me up, and start seeing his damage shield hit me for 2pst of damage.

Cute, enjoy it while it lasts.

Note that packets capture and protocol handling is the same code as AOMD, so if AOMD doesn't work with your network setup, ClickSaver won't work either.

I actually fixed the "coudln't open capture" bug yesterday. I debugged the interface crash problem today on a win95 machine, so although I coudln't fuully test clicksaver on the win95 machine, I'm rather confident that it should work on win98/me now.

Dont know if this one has been talked about, cant find it listed.

There seems to be a problem with exiting missions, when you exit the game auto sends you back in, the first time this happened I was able to log out and then back in and the problem went away.

The last time I was in a fight and when I left the mission, I zoned right back in ( you can guess the end results there).

This is the first day this has happened after the patch, have run about 20 mission before these last two so dont have a clue what up.   

Good luck in fixing this little <grin> problem.

noticed that in several missions now(mostly pickup, but then again.. thats the missions i mostly go for) you dont get offered a mission reward.. i.e when you browse the mission terminal, you wont see a mission reward as a reward, there are only 6 "free" slots where you normally expect to see the reward.
This happened to me on several occations, trying to pull missions in that second highest setting(ql 157 for me) and it was with solo missions.
I dont know if you didnt actually get a mission reward or not, since i didnt bother doing these missions, but anyway. it was annoying.

Victrix @ 4/15/2002 6:12:48 PM (IEC Flashpoint Laser Rifle-reload bug 20355):
This weapon has a mind of its own when it comes to reloading..manually or automatically but especially manually. This weap holds 5 rounds and therefore most soldiers that use it, reload manually after each kill. The probem is that sometimes it wil reload and sometimes it wont. It will even show 5 rounds 5/5 loaded and when you go to use it, get the...weapon out of ammunition. The recharge on this is 8 secs so the reload time is horrid, you stand there like an idiot getting pounded. Sometimes you can manually reload ad it will say 0/5 or empty. Try agin and same thing but then you fire the weapon and it fires away.

This needs a fix as it has been like this a long time and it is a "death" bug as things like this will get you killed and im tired of dieing to it!

After a clean reboot, I can start up AO just fine.  The second time my monitor goes black for a moment, then it TURNS OFF.  It is a "green" monitor, so no signal causes a powerdown.  The monitor never powers back up.  

I can hear the theme music play in the background, but I cannot /camp and exit (typing blind of course).  

NOTES:
I run in windows mode only.  It looks like it is toggling to full screen, then toggling back, only it forgets to toggle back the 2nd time.  Since the game is actually running in a window, the fullscreen view is of course blank.

CTRL-TAB doesn't do anything

CTRL-ALT-Del doesn't do anything (2 reset the computer of course).

yes AOMD worked fine for me.  I still use v3.0.  when i load it(AOMD) it asks me to select one of 5 adaptors.  When i loaded up clicksaver it didn't give me any options and when i clicked okay without selecting anything it said could not open netowrk capture or somrthing like it.

MORB @ 4/15/2002 9:58:54 PM (20247):
Ok. I looked at it and maybe found the problem... Try the new version (0.9.1), it may work now.

Deimos @ 4/15/2002 11:26:47 PM (20279):
I have had the same thing happen to me in different missions. In fact, one of my missions was a "fetch item" and when I was exiting the mission, it would immediately zone me back in. This happened everytime I tried to exit the mission and finally I was able to exit when I put the mission key into my backpack and exited. 

Normally this problem does not happen with the "describe item" missions, so long as you have picked up the item, because the key disappears from your inventory as soon as you pick it up.

Now that I know how to work around this bug it will not be so bad for me, but for a newbie that does not know what is happening, they are pretty much SOL and stuck in the mission until...

A. Death
B. Suicide
C. Mission Expires

Deimos @ 4/15/2002 11:35:08 PM (Accept Mission Bug 20414):
Sometimes, when I accept a mission, it is not transferred to my mission list. This seems to be random but it happens maybe 1/20 times when acepting missions.

I realize this isn't that big of a deal but it sure seems to waste my time and try my patience. Spent about 30 minutes looking for a Nova Flow and when I finally accepted the mission it did not transfer. 

Just for the record, I have made sure that I am  doing everything correctly and it still happens. I have even waited 5 minutes(more than enough) for it to appear in the list because I know sometimes it takes a few seconds to be transferred. I am not sure what causes it, so far it seems to be random.

Still doesnt work in Win 98. 

1. I locate the AO dir in the FC folder, "target" it and click ok.

2. I am asked to Select net... PPP or 3Com, I click 3Com (same as I do with AOMD) then Ok.

3. I get the message: "Couldn't open network capture"


AOMD works, not this one, maybe some of the problem AOMD had with Win 98 in the beginning too?

Mercatura @ 4/16/2002 1:18:37 AM (Kill target missions giving same side 20430):
Every once in awhile, my target in assassinate missions is the same side as me! Full good/money slider gives 3 of these in the first row.

Its pretty rare, but I only saw this after 14.0. I took screenshots hehe 

Is this intended? Doesn't seem to fit if it is, a traitorous Omni should be clan or neutral, right?  At least I should get xp

OtakuCODE @ 4/16/2002 1:19:11 AM (List of bugs I've encountered in the past couple days 20431):
Some of these may have been reported before, but I didn't see them on the first page of posts here, so I figured I would share mine so other players can know of these bugs (since Funcom doesn't care):

If you pop up into the boss level on a team mission, then leave back to the floor before and no one there is to take the bosses aggro, it still registers you as being in a fight and you cannot heal.
This remains until someone else goes up and gets aggroed on by the boss.

After leaving the bosses level, you can still be hit.  This caused several deaths for my teammates last night... ended up having to leave to heal when only at half health because otherwise instant-deaths were too common.

Team mission rewards are bugged like solo ones used to be regarding rewards.  I took a mission for an Enforcer nano, ended up with an Engineer nano instead.

Kinda bug:
Bosses should yield *MUCH* more xp than they currently do.  As it is, its a frikkin waste of time to even bother with them.  20 minutes of fighting and you only get as much xp as you do for the mobs that go down in 2 or 3 rounds.  At least there are usually some items in there.

Mercatura @ 4/16/2002 1:27:12 AM (19932):
Darn, last week I was getting level 12ish mobs with 8 point damage shields and you guys get away with 2? Hehe

 Not a bug, its becuase you are still on the same "zone" as the mob and it kinda makes alot of sence.

Team mission rewards are given out randomly

Tho i agree with the last one, more XP! MUCH MORE!

512k RAM!?!!?!?!!?!?!? Ouch, you mean mb right? 



Does this happen ONLY in AO?

OtakuCODE @ 4/16/2002 2:23:49 AM (20431):
I know that team mission rewards are given out randomly... what I mean is that I took the mission which included 1 Enforcer nano, and 1 trimmer as rewards.  When the rewards were handed out, a trimmer went to my partner, and an Engineer nano went to me.

And it doesn't make any sense that if you teleport to a different location that the enemy can not reach that you should be prevented from healing, its just stupid.  I know its the same zone, but so what?  How can I be "in a fight" if I am also in a completely safe area in no danger or taking damage and no opportunity to deal it?

And I said the last point wasn't really  bug   I consider it a game design bug, not a code one... the "color" of the enemy is also not quite right.  Obviously, HP is not taken into account in any way at all, let alone damage shields... the first boss I fought on the night these team misions started was a green to me.. and I had to hit him for 5 minutes just to use up his damage absorption shield!  Then it took another 15 minute of standing there hitting, not even using first aid kits or leave, to get the amazing reward of 100 or so xp.  Woop.

P.S.  All vitriole in this post is aimed directly at Funcom

MuscularBeaver @ 4/16/2002 6:17:15 AM (Where am I?  Annoying location bug. 20453):
I'm running along when suddenly I zone out the exit of a mission area long before I actually make it to the exit door.  Likewise, I've been pre-zoning from one outdoor area to another.  

This sort of thing has happened to me before, but it's been happening a LOT since the latest patch.  

As an aside, I also noticed that Rome was REALLY screwed up last night.  Zone doors didn't work.  Areas were missing.  Could have been just my client and not the server - don't know.

Nice =)
What a like about this that is better then AOMD is that you can minimize it, resize it and have better menues in it.

POSITIVES:
- Minimizable
- Resizeable
- Better watch menu
- Coords
- Cooler looking 'graphics' 
- Red marking of text that is added in the 'check' box.

NEGATIVES:
- Program crashes when having 'Item watch message box' checked in options. (program has executed a illegal operation etc..)
- Should've been tested more (on other OS etc.)

I'm running winXP Professional.

Very nice job  I'm using this instead of AOMD from now - Even though the watch message doesn't work for me, I can see it marked as red text when the item im looking for appear.

Micheal: how the hell do i explain my problem?
Nabu: like you explained it to me

Maximilian @ 4/16/2002 8:01:50 AM (Tokens in short missions and some other 14.0 bugs 20463):
Hello to all (including Funcom).

First of all I would like to ask, if somebody can confirm my observations.

By (my) priority:
1) I do not longer get tokens for short missions! If this is intended, please inform me(us) or correct it. Would be a rather dirty move!
2) The content of the backpacks in my inventory still rearranges (gnomes?!)
3) Permanent Nano Crsytals - Some crystals still do not dissapear, after you uploaded them.

Background:
-> 1) I started a second char, an Omni Engineer (Vermeer). One of the facts I was interested in - the token board. So I started collecting them. I (almost) always try to clean the mission before completing the task - so I do get a token quite often. At level 46 I have got 99 (no farming - straight solo leveling). At my actual level 'normal' missions take me ~ 1hour, sometimes even longer, to finish. So I am always happy (and looking for) grey cave type missions, because they are usually smaller. Since 14.0 it happened at least three times to me, that I didn't get a token, although the whole area was cleaned including traps and chests (two grey cave missions and one subway style). What I recognized is the following: The percentage calculating mechanism (chance for success) starts only after the fourth or so kill (Vorlaufzeit). It 'looks' like you have to kill a minimum number of mobs to get a chance at all (guessing) - all missions I didn't get a token for did contain 3 MOBs!
This might be a bug or intended, either way, I would like to know.
-> 2) No big deal, but my Omni-Med boots always rearrange in my implant backpack.
-> 3) Bad for you guys (FC). It seems, that nano crystals derived as mission reward (and/or mission find item) do not dissapear after uploading.  - Perma crystals - Another detail. I uploaded them out of a bag (by accident).
I usually sell these to the shop after uploading and so far there where no really valuable among them, but right now I have a rather nice loot only Engi crystal (ql41 only - calm down) .... Just wanted to inform you. 

So long,

Max(imilian)

Adjuster @ 4/16/2002 8:20:49 AM (20463):
I noticed those crystals yesterday as well. After uploading the crystal is still in my inv, but it says it got zero charges left.
Think I sold the empty crystal for like 4 credits...   ooooohh. Im rich!

einexile @ 4/16/2002 8:52:25 AM (19855):
I have noticed this problem mostly in Last Ditch. It is quite apparent along the path into the central city from the whompa. It seems as though my feet are getting caught on the connections between the metal floor textures. I've been able to jump over them every time.

It's unfortunate that as they continue to weed out problems with this game, it seems they introduce new problems - both unintentionally and intentionally but in secret - with nearly every patch.

I was a leet with a helmet because of these people. I will not forget this. :(

RedSonja @ 4/16/2002 11:34:53 AM (20463):
You shouldn't get a token for a mission containing anything less than 5+ green+ mob's.

This has been in play for a long time, it was then promptly broken after the "wonderful devaluation of tokens" patch where walking into a 3 mob mission, all grey netted you a token - lots of 1000 boards earn't that weekend.

It has now been fixed again to how it was, missions with 3 mobs will never get tokens and I'd say 1 in every 5 missions with 4 mobs may net you one.

Odac @ 4/16/2002 12:04:47 PM (20461):
Nabu: did you die 
Micheal: yes but im not level 6... and 6 is when the penalties come into play ... 
			
		
	
When you die, whatever level, you respawn with lower stats for 5 or so minutes. This is so you can't just jump back into the same battle/mission/PvP fight. It's just a temporary penalty for dieing. The skills will rise gradually until you get a message saying something like 'you feel ok now' at which point they are at normal levels.

Level 6 is when you start to lose unsaved xp when you die, I think that's the only penalty.

If you knew this already and deem the above information useless, consider it a bump =)

Maximilian @ 4/16/2002 12:08:38 PM (20463):
Thanks, RedSonja.

I don't have any problems accepting this 'rule' (sounds really solid - minimum effort to get a token), but honestly I never heard about it in any official 'statement' (not disqualifying your's).

Due to the young age of Vermeer (3 weeks) and my lack of experience in the token business (Max is neutral) I might have missed it, but can anybody point me towards any 'official' word.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Forth @ 4/16/2002 5:13:22 PM (20341):
Saw one of those myself the other night -- reward was "Free".

Was trying to think positive and figure out whether this meant:

a free extra space in my bank
a free extra space in my inventory
one free month of gameplay
one 'get out of root/snare' free card
the ever elusive "Map of Broken Shores"
a free backpack

but then figured it'd probably delete something random off of my character and consider that to be "free"..


fix, please!

Forth @ 4/16/2002 5:20:24 PM (Cannot Drop Items in Missions 20524):
Since 14.0, my friends and I have been having problems dropping items in pickup missions (individual mission, not team).  

This is a problem when the item in question happens to be the MO.

First time: could not drop item.  Gave to another teammate.  They could not drop the MO.  Attempted decorating the mission wall with some spare ammo.  Could not do so.  Someone had to take item, zone, come back, and then could drop it.

Second time: same thing.

3rd time: same thing.

4th time: zoning and camping repeatedly -- could not drop MO.
Mission could not be completed.  The "found item" for this one was a nano crystal, which was different from the other times.  We also had a teammate disband, but those were the only differences I recall.

Forth @ 4/16/2002 5:22:16 PM (20109):
I've lost the XP to a teammate's DoT, if the DoT got the killing blow in.

Go figure.

RedSonja @ 4/16/2002 5:24:08 PM (20463):
I'm not sure you'll find an official word on it 
By trade my main character has done a lot of token runs, hence not being impressed when they devalued the 600 Tokens I had earn't at one token=one token, not four or five like it is now.

Because she has done a lot of missions she has worked this out totally by what experiences she has had.
Since a few patches ago I've never seen a 3 MOB mission give a token and only very rarely seen a 4 MOB mission do so.
5 MOB+, as long as they are all at least green, has certainly almost always given me a token, so long as I've cleared the whole place out.

Greenhawk @ 4/16/2002 6:40:54 PM (20463):
Just FYI, it appears that you only reach "100%" chance of a token after killing every mob in a mission.  Also, it appears that only killing mobs matters... uncovering the mission rooms is meaningless.

Txxx @ 4/16/2002 7:56:22 PM (20279):
I petitioned about this last night.  An ARK showed up an acknowledged that it is a bug.  He claimed that you could tell if the mission would have this problem by looking at the design of the mission entrance.  The ones with the problem have a cave look to them with a sort of rock platform before the entrance.  The mission location I had probs with is in Aegean Delirium, if you run missions there, you'll be familiar with it.  

He also stated that if you delete the mission key before exiting, you will be able to exit, which makes sense.  I imagine also if it is a mission that does not require the return of an item then you could also exit after completing the mission.

I just uploaded version 1.0.1 that (I hope) will at least fix this. The problem is that I have only WinXP pro at home and can't install win98 currently to test...
I had two différence with AOMD when opening network capture: I set it in non-promiscuous mode, and I added a filter to get only TCP packets. I now try to open network in promiscuous mode if onn promiscuous fails, and I removed the filter to receive only tcp packets (which is actually a bit useless)
I hope this will fix the problem with win98/ME.

I double checked the code, and I run under winxp professional too. I may have to build a special version with some debug logs and give it to you to find the problem...

Mercatura @ 4/16/2002 10:34:55 PM (20463):
It is possible to reach 100% chance of token and still have some mobs left. Usually this happens in large missions with 30+ mobs. I know because killing each one only bumps it 3% 

Often it happens with rats in chests count towards the percent, and assassinate targets seem to not count as part of the 'total' number of mobs, but do count for the %. Thankfully it adds them to your percent a few seconds before you get your reward 

However, I have gotten to 100% in pickup item missions with no rats, and theres still 2 or 3 mobs wandering around. So whatever determines the number of kills to hit 100% is not quite so cut and dry.

Mercatura @ 4/16/2002 10:42:48 PM (20463):
The nanos that use their charge and do not vanish are always the pickup item in "describe item" missions. In the past these were the 'master nanos' that were used by many people.

I heard about people somehow creating 'master' nanos of things like Grid Armor and Nullity Sphere, but since those are tradeskill only, I haven't the foggiest idea how they did it. Thats usually the case with cheaters, its not like they're going to come out and tell the world later 

I had someone give me half a dozen high-level depleted nanos, and they still sold well to the shops, about 400,000 credits or so. Guess those shop terminals aren't so smart?

Mercatura @ 4/16/2002 10:52:52 PM (20524):
Maybe this was a little hack of theirs to reduce the server crashing missions?

I can live with the "fix" if it means I am a lot less likely to get dropped inside a mission, and log back on with 3 very angry mobs killing me while I load. Even more so with team missions; 6 people logging back at slightly different times in slightly different locations getting the stuffing beaten out of them in a not-so-slight way by 6 slightly different mobs

OKay when i run clicksaver it opens and askes me which folder anarchy online is in.  Pick the folder everything is fine.  Then brings up list of adapters too choose from everything is fine.  Now the adapter is use for the AOMD is the last on the list so i click on the scroll bar to slide down to the bottem and my whole comp goes boom

the adapters all turn invisible in the list although i can still click on the indivdual adapters and see what it says.  After opening the entire interface turns black.  The title bar is overwritten by something along with the title bar of every program i have running (IE and anarchy) any folders open loose their title bars.  Windows desktop goes in skitz mode reqiuring complete system reboot to correct the problem.  Just got another fatal error while typing this not enough memory to create or display a graphic. on your webpage non the less.

As for the interface itself everything except small parts has turned black so i can't read what to do or actually test how it works.

Downloading debug version now will send results to you along.

Thanks guys and girl(s) for your input.

I indeed got a semi official answer from an ARK yesterday, where he stated exactly what you, RedSonja, already said: You have to kill 'a minimum' amount of MOBs to get a chance for a token 'at all'. So it seems, three is definitely not enough (fully accepted). I will have a look on this furtheron.

Concerning the nano crystals: I still have a 'interesting' one, that was the pick item in a mission. I assume it won't vanish after uploading (several levels -> IP), but I will check, if you can upload again afterwards.

So long,

Zerpentor @ 4/17/2002 8:53:29 AM (no token chance increase when... 20622):
when you kill a mob standing in ooze or lava your chance for a token will not increase, leaving you unable to reach 100% chance

(and we ALL know the it it say 98% you will definately hit the remaining 2% and not get a token for your efforts)

Zerpentor @ 4/17/2002 9:30:06 AM (My buglist, suggestions and requests 20625):
ok here goes... some of them might not be bugs. all these are based on my own experiences..

Mobs:
 still hit you through walls, shoots after reaching 0 HP, warp to you when you try to escape, chaincast (havent seen it since 14.0) 

Battlesuits: emotes are disabled when wearing battle suits, shrink/grow bracers are not wearable with suits, all battle suits are brown (eventhough they show up different on the icon), weapon does not show when wearing battle suit.

Yalmahas: scaling screws up when exiting your yalm. 

skills: Concealment (need i say more?), skills like Adventuring, perception, GRENADE, trap disarm, water vehicle, melee energy are more or less useless and definately not worth the IPs for any profession

nanos: 
Quantum wings should not terminate when going indoors, just be disabled and reactivate when going outside. Quantum wings should be castable indoors but not activated untill going outside. 
Several Doc nanos does not work (think it's the ones that cancel hostile nanos from your NCU so when you if this make SURE you can cast it at teammember's pets) 

Pets:
 PATHING!!! pets get stuck 2 out of 3 rooms, healpet responds only haft the time, pets doesnt zone with you sometimes, increase damage done by pets (enmity line does more damage than demons wtf??) pathing, pathing, pathing, pathing.

Tradeskills: 
we need stuff to build, almost all item constructions are broken. Only my guildie Lilbob has had luck with building some items like QL20ish fiddle rifle and a +11 sense shoulderpad.
Nano crystals cost insanely much to create so either remove the disks for shop nanos or reduce creation cost. Please explain how tutoring was meant to work, because 1 point.... come on...

Equipment and Nanos
give the Engineers some new nanos to play with... they have nothing compared to us MPs or Crats. 
make Nullity sphere and grid armor more common. 
give MPs a better looking healpet instead of that meatball/blowfish
more decent SMGs for fixers
reduce dual wield for pistols
add decent Grenade throwers
fix biomech armor and cloaks
add more clothing
add more furniture
increase apartment furniture allowed to atleast 20 (the apartment is huge compared to the 10 items allowed)
add nameable backpacks
add more vehicles

missions:
Please let us know what ALL the mission sliders does like... Hidden/Open
missions for Deep artery valley should NOT be offered to a lvl 12 char :PPP
let us sort out some rewards like nano critters, clothes, maps if we are looking for a nano crystal or weapon.

hunting: please add some viable hunting spots for lvl 100+ chars

this is all i can think of at the moment )

Lilbob @ 4/17/2002 10:57:20 AM (20625):
im gonna slap my list on now 
 most of this will be a re-itteration of what zerp just said
here goes:

first and formost why is it impossible for an soltius, opiflex and atrox to self cast any kind of slayer?
this i wouldnt exactly call fair in the aspect that eventually mps and crats can self buff theres and caco through tests has proven to be tougher than a slayer.

sentinel is broken 869 skill requirement but it asks for 874 to use it even though it blatantly shows 869 to use. would like to see this fixed soon.

Boss mobs in team missions are too hard, they crit for 60% and have disgusting hp they dont need guards to boot, makes it almost impossible to fight a boss, either lower the bosses crit % or remove the guard mobs.

Aggro first it was intended to be lowered, but what we get is it increased, i understand why in team missions, but if you take a single mission and get someone to help you the aggro is exactly the same as a team mission, if that person leaves it remains the same.

Virral eggs are stuidly rare, the den is hard enough to get into to get to the queen, only to find its rare drop and the queen is rare on spawn, this should be an everytime drop.

De-corona armor to avoid camping on it make it so every smuggler drops a piece much like the cyborg dungeon, rather than increasing there aggro making it impossible to get.

Tarasque has way too much of the rare loot on him distribute it from tarasque to other NPCs camelot is near damn impossible to get into due to gankers waiting on the door due to it being 25% not only that why is tarasque room 25%? hes hard enough without someone attacking you from behind.

Make the rare disks not so rare make em more common
nullity, grid armor and beacon warp team to mention a few definates
these are class specialist nanos why make them so hard to get?
grid armor is a must to be brought out of rare spawn most fixers become dependent on this at high level. you dont have to do them all just mk1 nullity, mk1 + 2 grid armor, team beacon and izzys lil nuke.

fix the trade skill manuals, they have been broke since day 1 and have never been looked into, i was fortunate enough as zerp mentioned to find a manual that worked.

i like the fact that we can build things like robot brains (sense shoulder modifier) and special weapons (pepper pistol)
why not give us some things like armor building? 
this could be a special type of armor that starts life as a form (like the crat suit)
you hack it send it  off, get the main part, add other parts and you get a special armor type.
add different parts for the robot brains to make them do different modifiers (int,phy etc)

mission booths should bring up more class related things, im sick of looking in a booth for something and getting an item pop up thats for a competely different class.

shrink, grow bracers should be more than just visual
shrink should increase concealment and growth increase max hp.

FIX pathing, its getting worse patch by patch, pets now have a terrible habit of roaming back 3-4 rooms and getting stuck or running straight into a wall rather than through a door.

make nano crystal building costs lower, if not the parts the tools its insane paying 2-3 mil for a set of tools to do it, i was lucky as i was helped out by my guildies on this *big hug to OI*

mobs still have the ability to heal all the way to full hp and do this everytime they drop to a certain ammount of hp, we get no extra xp for our time spent fighting them.

why do mobs never reload, recharge there nanos, follow casting time rules?

why does every other mob seem to have LMA running even the lower lvl ones?

you wanted the mobs to behave more like a human player so they should also follow casting time rules, not be able to crit so much, have to pause for a few seconds to reload, have a proper nano pool.

lower the skill needed to wear q200 implants as now there are classes that cannot put these in and this is not fair, i myself am a class that doesnt suffer from this but soldiers, enforcers, etc
do suffer from this and it makes life for them extremly difficult at lvl 150+

lower the required skill on a q200 shen
MAs cant use it at all no point in a q200 shen if it cant be used.

idea for mission item choosing:
allow a player to select what kind of reward they are after like a submenu of missions, sections like:
Item Type:
weapon
nano crystal
clothing/armor

it would make life much easier and ease conjestion around mission booths like the one in newland.

set a penalty to people that continusly gank and greive others, for instance loss of title, loss of creds, max xp needed for the lvl they are on is increased, etc

people are getting pretty anoyed with constant violators of this, who go out of there way to make other players games a misery, they shouldnt go unpunished, this rule should be if they are green no pentalty incurred, its basically even grounds, if they are a lvl below green a warning, do it again penalty, ganking someone 2 or more levels below teamable level, instant penalty.

this way pvp would be made much fairer as fighting would be placed at a more even ground.

more choice in weaponry and armor, it only drops to a select few types, make more weapons and armor that are good contenders then there will be much more variation in what people wear.

you could make it so each class has a few types of armor that only there class can wear, like MA suit should be MA only or special sneak suits (increases concealment) that are agent only.

increase the apartment item allowance.
add more furnature
add more clothing
add the ability to edit your appartment (long term goal but its possible as you can do this in AC)

more outdoor hunting areas NOT in 25% zones for 100+ players

more vehicles including team vehicles (must be teamed to use req) this could be a juggernaught for instance.

Let the MAs Kick, i know its in there but if an ma class it should not be rare in the random attack it should be once every say 4-5 attacks, not once every 1 billon attacks

add more static dungeons, these are great, but at least make it so:
the existing ones are not worthless to go to like they are now, due to mob aggro radiuses, rareity of items, 25% zones, etc.

new ones should not be caves, every static dungeon seems to be based round the bland and done to death cave, even camelot as its a cave under the castle, smugglers is a cave approach, and steps of madness is a cave from beginning to end.

I like TLR dungeon its different but low levels need apply same with the borg dungeon.
For high levels its should be a fortress strong hold, in the desert for clans (an omni forward desert stronghold) and in milky way for omnis (clan forward assault base). there should be a named NPC boss at the end like a high ranking officer who you must defeat, this boss should carry special items like special armor or special weapons with modifiers, or an affilation dependent item like a special type of ring of power that drops from the OT boss for the clans and a special Type of armor dropped from the Clan boss for OTs, its should be set so everyone fight bosses of either side and get and use these items much like TLR, but the general boss due to his rank should definatley have 2 guards to his room, and these should be hard due to them being supreme bodygaurds.
they should also drop something special either a special bracer or a shoulder slot special item.

Just a few bug mentions and ideas for ya there 
hopefully these will be taken into account and fixed or with the ideas implemented sometime in AOs future!

RedSonja @ 4/17/2002 11:06:15 AM (19697):
Yup, it makes things difficult for those with either too little time to do missions or not able to take part in team missions.

In theory everybody should be able to get a complete suit of the armour of their choice in QL125 from the shops.
I wouldn't even mind the flying from town to town and at different times IF I knew that there was a chance of a QL125 Graft chest spawning.

It's getting extremely fustrating, I've been stuck with the same QL105 Graft Chest for a long time and my base attributes without a single buff are a lot higher than the requirements.

Tyndel @ 4/17/2002 3:03:06 PM (Some annoying bugs in missions(again) 20670):
Ohh.. the joy of facing monster pathing in missions...

Was going through a mission here today, and walked into to a human mob(visbuilder i think) with a table in the room between us.  the mob sees me, aggs on me, and promptly runs out the door.. and diseappers off my radar.. i get that good old attacked by noone message.. ohwell i think.. he didnt want to die.. i dont care.. then i try to heal up.. UHoh.. im still in fight with the friggin mob I.e .. no healing. oki.. i go after him, try to calm my way to him to get him to stop fighting me. i find him in a room with 2 other mobs, and the second i step into room next to him, another mob opens the door, and all 3 mobs in there rush me, seems they all agged on me cause one of the mobs were "fighting" me(and no.. i have never landed a hit on the mob, i was calming my way through the dungeon, so i was defensive).
i give up this mission and delete it..  then move on to the next one.
this one also works well for a while. .get suitably far into the dungeon.. then suddenly one of the human mobs, (a clerk) aggs on me from a different room, through a open door.. he also has problems finding me.. so he runs into the wall, and stands there shooting at me. I cant target him, and when i try to run into another room to get away, well. .the mob goes invisible, but keeps shooting me.. not surprisingly .. i die again. 

So in conclucion.. i have this to say.. FIX THIS #¤&%#¤%#¤&#¤ PATHING OF MOBS!!!!!!!!!!!!! Im sick and tired of dying to mobs that cant find me, but still shoot me, mobs that go invisible, and keeps killing me. 

And while you are at it.. fix the syncing of mobs too.. when i calm a mob.. i dont expect him to keep shooting a last shot at me.. Im sick and tired of having a mob kill me with his last shot AFTER i calm him..!!!!!  This BUG also means that any form of deflect or damage shield, or item are worse than useless for any calmer. .as it breaks the calms as fast as i can cast them...

spaztic @ 4/17/2002 3:15:35 PM (OK this is a big bug. It seems as though I'm the only one with the problem 20674):
I've been trying to get a couple simple devices, a screwdriver, and a biotech-something-another. both used for making sellable & usable items from monster parts & robot junk. 

The problem is when I got to the terminals in the trade room that sell these items the terminals are empty. In the group of terminals that contain these items the only one I can see items in it the implant terminal. Also the terminals are all named "name missing". 

Now someone had suggested that I reinstall. I did that and it didn't help. in fact its worse. I was at least able to see the names of most of terminals before. Now I can't. 

Now I know that the terminals are the right ones for the items I'm looking for. As I had said in an earlier post that I was escorted there by a friend. This friend also purchased one of the items for me. then traded it to me. unfortunately, when he traded it to me (screwdriver) I was given nothing. I accepted a blank trade. but moments later I had a "no name" item in my inventory. 

So please someone help me. I feel that there is a lot in this game that I'm not able to enjoy because of this malfunction. 

Thank you 

Kallis, 
Omni soldier

MORB @ 4/17/2002 8:22:41 PM (20247):
Ok. I debugged my user interface library and the bug that it wasn't actually freeing gdi pens and brushes. It was rather harmless under 2k/xp (although it was probably causing a slow memory leak), but it was eating up all pens and brushes under win98/me so that it couldn't draw anything anymore...

There was also a bug with windows resizing that was showing up only under win98/me, fixed.

Since I got the interface working properly under win95 and my little fix yesterday fixed the "couldn't open capture" error, I think it should actualy work under win98/me this time :)

MORB @ 4/17/2002 11:43:54 PM (20624):
I had it on the 12.7 download when I started to play... But they removed it some versions later (maybe so that it stills fits on a single cd, with the etxras data they tossed in the patches since then)

The intro is on the funcom's ftp though:
ftp://ftp.funcom.com/cd/intro.exe

Just put it in the AO folder and it'll play it when you check the play intro box.

Ratty @ 4/18/2002 2:39:17 AM (20645):
And where would someone read "the news"?
I actually did do a search before posting, all I found was someone summarized all the bugs, but it looked like it was a player just noticing it, I was looking for an official response.
I heard there was some exploit related to it so they disabled it, but thats just rumors.

Meegor @ 4/18/2002 3:44:44 AM (My teamates keep disapearing from view, cant target 20757):
Lately in missions I have been freaked out when my whole team seems to disappear... I run around the room and my team says they are standing right next to me.  I cant target them.. dont see them in team window...very freaky when you are main puller..only to pull to what seems to be an empty room.

hobbes @ 4/18/2002 2:29:37 PM (20674):
Spaz, 

I had your same problem. Mine started with the inability to use the implant machines. I talked to GM Lucien and he determined that I needed to reinstall and repatch the game.

Since I had already download the 11.0-14.0 patch file(14.0 corrupt file problem), I thought I would just reinstall AO, then run the patcher.

After doing that, I re-entered the game. All my inventory was "No Name" and the newer machines like the bookstore were also "No Name", so apparently not all data had been reinstalled.

What I did then was to delete everything. First by using the "remove program", then by deleting the directory manually, deleting the downloaded patch fom my desktop, manually. Finally, I used find to search for any remaining "anarchy*.*" files. I found a few "anarchy.err" files, and erased them.

With this clean slate, I reinstalled the game, then re-downloaded the big patch file into my ao directory, then patched again. I think I used that AP.exe, (A file I had not noticed before).

Anyway, I may have done redundant steps as I am not a computer savvy person, but it worked. Good luck and I hope you have a cable modem.

........


now, since they are NOT reflect's, and that is established, lets move on.
they do damage to any attacking you. fine. you are saying that dot nanos are an attack. i for one agree, in principle...and should hit the guy with damage when he casts the nano. lets say...a doc or agent hitting you with a virus/poison.

ok, so when he hits ya, he should get the damage. yep. i agree. completely.

but after that, the bots are in your system. that mob could be DEAD and you'd still be attacked. if it was a player, they could zone, and you would still be hit buy those  (cencored) little bots.

i agree that the first one should be dealt with, and damage applied. but after that.....dig the lil buggers out, cause ya don't want that damage shield affecting things inside yer body.

No more master nanos, it will be '0 charges' after you upload it, but won't disspear. If you want to be a jack@ss, sell it to someone after using, j/k.

Avoid making bitter enemies and sell to the vendor. I unwittingly sold a 0 charge nano to someone after the patch that fixed them, and it nearly tainted me for good.

DieWolf @ 4/19/2002 6:43:58 AM (Mobs on Iceskates? 20953):
It seems everytime I fight a mission, the mobs instead of running to me to attack sorta slide or iceskate across the terrain instead. This makes most of my long range attacks useless since the mobs can skate over to me before i acn even get  a round off.....

MuscularBeaver @ 4/19/2002 6:51:35 AM (Anyone else losing skills? 20955):
I've lost 1 point here and there, but my trader seems to have lost a whole bunch of shotgun skill points recently.  

I distinctly remember some levels ago (about level 38) that I could pump up my shotgun skill to over 300 after casting shotgun expertise and then ransack skills (or deprive skills, or both - I forget which increases the shotgun skill).  

Suddenly I logged in one day and used the *same* nanos, but couldn't get the skill anywhere near 300.  Even at level 42 now, I can only get the skill up to 301.  

I don't care about the number itself. For all I know, the 301 number is the "fair" one and the previous one was the bug.  I'm just curious if this is happening to others out there.

runey @ 4/19/2002 7:42:51 AM (20885):
Aegean surrounds Wartorn Valley, the area that is just outside the east gate of Old Athen. So instead of heading, let's say, north out of that Old Athen gate, go south and then keep going until you zone.

You know I did read that article, but at the time i never heard of that quest so it didnt stick. Its like blah blah something youve never heard of doesnt work.
Wow nobody in game meantioned that article either while seeing people camped at alvin. I'd say hey quest is broken, and they are like oh you noticed it too.
geez, why dont they just make alvin say "go away im broken", how hard would that be to temporarily change, or just remove him altogether until its fixed? Oh wait but that would be removing dangling carrots, funcom doesnt believe in that (shop of fortune, bogus quest leads, team mission terms long before they worked, etc. ). Not that it takes the blame from my lack of RTFMing or anything...  But I just vent now and then, maybe i should try prozac.

Just gave a mission with this "free" reward slot, just to see what it was(and because the pickup item was a mochams )
And not surprisingly, the reward was....... Nothing. nada.. zip
So atleast. .you get what you were promised.. Still this is annoying.



And on another note, seen some times that when i accept a mission, it doesnt show up in my mission view, its not that i have too many missions or anything, it just doesnt show up, the mission popup screen goes away.. and the mission is lost.. but i dont get it..  This is somewhat annoying after having camped a terminal for hours looking for ncu missions

The Grenade launcher model is very short, yet still the toon uses the assault rifle hand position. The result is that the toons left hand is about a foot in front of the gun barrel holding nothing but air. It looks very bad. One way to fix this might be to extend the model out a bit. 

Also, why does a shotgun get so much higher crit numbers than a grenade? Is the grenade's explosion that weenie? Already if you want to use a grenade launcher you have to deal with the 1 round clip, why does the crit damage suck so bad? 

Thanks and this is meant to be constructive and not a flame of this interesting game. 

P.S. edit: I also wanted to add, how come the grenade ammo is so much more expensive than other ammo types? 840 for 25 shots? I mean its not uber or anything

Tricia50 @ 4/19/2002 6:28:00 PM (20955):
You're not the only one. Check out the thread referenced in my sig (same as the one above, actually, but  wanted to bump this. Think I'll bump the other, as well).

Garzu @ 4/19/2002 8:34:04 PM (20247):
Works on 98 now.   Team missions dont. get error and the program quits. Maybe I should read the read me file?

MORB @ 4/19/2002 8:58:54 PM (20247):
Team missions aren't supported yet, I don't even know what it does when you pull it while running clicksaver... Although someone told me on another forum that he's using clicksaver with team missions because of the location search.

I'm currently reinstalling 98 to test clicksaver and I hope find the last big bugs.

Jeamus @ 4/19/2002 9:14:51 PM (20247):
I installed Clicksaver last night but ran into a problem.  After installing the program and selecting my network card I closed Clicksaver since I had not started up AO yet.  After starting AO and getting to a mission terminal I minimized AO and double clicked on the Clicksaver shortcut on my desktop.  The little toolbar box in the bottom of the screen came up saying clicksaver but the program window was no where to be found.  I right clicked the toolbar box thinking it was minimized but there was no min/max option listed.  I right clicked and closed the program and tried starting it up from the orginal icon but I got the same thing, program listed in the toolbar box but the program window was no where to be found.  Any idea on what could be happening?

I got the program window after I installed the program but after closing it, I have not seen it since.

I am running Windows XP with a P4 1.7, Turtle Beach Sound Card, Geforce3, with a Kingston eithernet card.  (The card did appear in the setup screen and I did select the right one.)

sbermunk @ 4/19/2002 9:47:38 PM (20341):
That happened to me the other day, too: I accepted a mission I wanted a lot, and it didn't end up in my missions list.

Boinkin @ 4/19/2002 10:48:27 PM (20988):
Can you browse the internet when this happens? 

Make sure that you don't have naything else running and sucking up your bandwidth, like a virus, or sumtin. Try removing and resinstalling your TCP/IP stack if possible. 

I was getting this for a while and I think it was the DSL servers themselves.

just typed "/tell omnibot list" - a system message,
can not send the message,
receiver offline and inbox full ( no wonder )

grrr... i will have to get my the damn armor myself now...

Also since omnibot is down, it's difficult to sell everything...

Anyone know what is going on ?

Crain @ 4/19/2002 11:38:57 PM (collision detection 21091):
Has anyone been having troubles walking around the Last Ditch areas of Stret West Bank?  It seems that there are "invisible walls" at certain places such as south of the Whom-pah from Borealis and also the road west of the Whom-pah.  It's not a problem with slow loading graphics, but I think it has more to with collision detection.  I was just wondering if this problem is local to my computer or if other people are experiencing the same strange phenomena.

I just fixed it. It was another problem of non freed gdi objects. This time I reinstalled win98 and tested it myself, it seems to be as stable as on winxp now (at least for me ;))

Jeamus: well, it looks like a bug... I'll try to reproduce it.

Ceneria @ 4/20/2002 3:15:09 AM (This must be really old, but still annoying as hell 21111):
Hiya.

Did a team mission some hours ago.. everything was just perfect. cave mission. around 500 or 1k mobs on mission. We'd killed about 40% of them when I jump up above some water. I took 1k fall dmg. stands there and tellls my teammates about it. when trying to walk from there, inside wall/roof I fell and took 1k dmg about 60-70 times a row.

xenomorph @ 4/20/2002 4:14:08 AM (is it just me? 21117):
Has anyone noticed that since the last patch the server sync is way off? I can not count how many times in a mission that when I was fighting a mob my chr shoots his gun 10-15 times nothing happens but yet I'm takeing dmg and the mob isnt, then out of now where it floods my screeen (thats if I am still alive long enough). I have died 3 times tonight due to this F***ing bug!

What ever you did funcom to help lag issue's you made it worse!

speardancer2 @ 4/20/2002 8:16:55 AM (Found out what they did with the Low Light Scopes 21128):
Hey, I know why we're not getting any low light scopes anymore!!!

They gave them all to the mobs !!!

I swear, I just finished a mission where even the greens were criting every other hit, and the oranges EVERY TIME !!!!!!


WTF !!!!!!

AkodoReign @ 4/20/2002 8:18:00 AM (21128):

I don't twink, guess that's my problem

speardancer2 @ 4/20/2002 8:33:49 AM (Funcom, I don't twink, may I still play??? 21131):
Hey, Cosmic, Coz, whoever's out there !!!!!!!!

I'm one of these players out here who don't do any OE, don't twink... a matter of fact, can't, my char isn't high enough to support himself, much less another low level char.

Why is it so damn hard for me to play ??????

I get by, don't get me wrong.  not like I can't kill a green... well, ok, my 55 advent almost can't sometimes.   She looks at her pistols, and then at everyone else's shotguns, and just sort of wonders....

My NT is doing fine, for a casual player.   But I havn't updated some of my armor in weeks, because there's none to be had.  I'm a nano NT, so I'm looking for int/psi armor, or perhaps psi/stam as a backup.   Only cyber to be had in the shops is helmets and boots, and the occasional sleeve, which is way too damn low of a QL.  Energized is just as hard to find, except you find the gloves sometimes too.  Oh, and don't EVEN tell me to go look in missions, I see tons of str/sta armor there, but barely anything I can use... and when it is there, it's too low of a QL.

I'm really hoping for some balance to start creeping back into the game after 14.2......... if it gets worse, I might end up on that canceled account list.

AkodoReign @ 4/20/2002 9:10:53 AM (21128):

Baldie @ 4/20/2002 2:42:51 PM (20997):
If your under attack, you cant use your treatment labs, always been that way.  If you change levels in a dungeon, you dont change zones.  If you REALLY need to go and use those labs then you have to zone.  

In team missions, if you all bail from the boss zone, then at least some of you can use your labs.  If you let some ppl go in and take the "heat" , then you can use your labs and go in after them.  (The mobs will no longer be attacking you if they start kicking someone else in the teeth)

-Baldie

Baldie @ 4/20/2002 2:47:03 PM (21117):
Sync is bad for me too, I rarely ever see my teamate NT cast his Nanos, but i see the damage scrolling in the text.   And sometimes after the fight, I'd hear all the attack nano sounds after the thing is dead.  Like 5 or 6 shots in rapid succession, which were all the sounds I should have heard while the NT was casting.  Still never get the visuals though... not even when he's buffing.

-Baldie

Baldie @ 4/20/2002 3:31:58 PM (21037):
Greneade launcher, and hand grenades for that matter, were written off as "useless" minutes after they were first tried.  Why? 

For grenade launchers Damage is similar to some pistols, shotguns, and other assorted weapons.  If not less then some weapons of similar quality.  And even if the damage is slightly higher in some cases, the Fire-reload-fire-reload of the gren launcher makes killing a mob take forever.  Any other weapon actually holds more then one shot, so doing damage with a gren launcher becomes a bit unwise.  

Hand grenades....  pay loads of cash for 1 grenade.  And it doesnt do a whole lot of dmg for the money.  And if you want to even try to use them... Throw, equip, throw, equip, throw....

Grenades, Nice toy, thats about it.   Ya might as well try to beat them to death with a Reet doll.  

I wish they were worth using, I'd love for my Engineer to use them.  But Im rather fond of living through my battles. 

-Baldie

Baldie @ 4/20/2002 3:36:21 PM (20622):
Not a bug, a "feature".

You get no credit for killing a mob while it's in the ooze.  Which sucks when you come across those Plant things that dont move.  It's a fix to an old exploit that people would get credit for killing mobs that were stuck in the slime.  If you ever fight anything near that green slime, get them out of it before you kill them.  (if you can) 

-Baldie

Also no increase in the % when things go bad and I have to zone out and my pet stays in and finishes one or two mobs off while I'm not in the mission. Very serious design flaw for the pet professions, especially if you have decided to go the non combat way.

iceman69 @ 4/20/2002 8:01:19 PM (casting mp creation weapons 21195):
rite i know when these r cast they r suposed to take away health from the mp, fair enough.
initilay when i casted them it would apear that i had no health until i got healed or i lost health which would return my health to normal.
now when i cast them it apears that i have 0 health and i start doing that slow walking. but when healed my health doesn't change, i can still take hits, as a doc on my team once described it was like i had minus health. also when i move in that slow way when u got low health i watch my self running slow but i can walk into zones that are quite far away like the speed i should actualy be going is being projected or something.
to fix this i either have to zone, or like the other day i had to log when i was in the middle of pm. but beacause of this slow walking effect when i logged my pets were off miles fighting but i could cast new 1s. the fighting pets prevented me from rejoining my team i left whilst logging.
this is extremely frustraiting for me and people i team with seen as i only use mp creation weapons and because they have to b recast every 2 hours.

so Funcom,   whats the deal here??

There is a small rule that could be easilly applied :

YOU break it,   YOU pay for it!

since we all pay to play, some even pay minute-fees when online!

Maximilian @ 4/22/2002 4:02:04 PM (20463):
Thanks again for all the help and advice, just want to add my (final) observations:

- Tokens in short missions. It looks like you need to have at least 5 (five, please don't nail me that number) MOBs/NPCs in your mission, to get a chance on a token. Cleared two small grey cave missions with 7 and 8 MOBs in it, % counting started first after I killed the 5th MOB.

- Rearrangements in back packs. Happens often when I die, no real cause detected, so far.

- No Master Nanos - they stay but have 0 charges left. Nevertheless, they sell to the vendor (loot only ones especially good - got 10k for my empty ql40 crystal). I will try to manufacture some crystals in the future and will check these as well.

So long,

Max(imilian)

RedSonja @ 4/22/2002 5:05:30 PM (20463):
Am I right in assuming from that last post that you actually got a token for completing a mission containing nothing but grey MOBS?

Killrmeta @ 4/22/2002 5:05:53 PM (Fix PET PATHING!! 21512):
Since 14.0, I've gone from someone who can deal good dmg in a group to someone who just runs around the whole mission trying to find his pets that keep getting stuck. This issue really needs to be addressed.

Checkbit @ 4/22/2002 6:12:35 PM (21128):
Well, if I start taking small amounts of radiation damage every 6 seconds when fighting an Atrox mob (pssst, he's talking about Da Taunter)... I'm gonna be upset.  =P

Relarin @ 4/22/2002 6:40:12 PM (16701):
And I thought it was just me!   

I started playing just prior to 14.0 and almost NEVER had problems with the first room with 2-3 enemies.  I could always wait until they were widely spread, get the nearest to aggro on me and run it back to my bot.   Now, the second the initial enemy aggros, all others in the room aggro...and sometimes enemies in adjacent rooms as well.   Not unusual to end up with 4-5 attacking...and of course they IGNORE the bot hitting them for 50+ damage and run at me.    Even if I am hiding in another room along the wall enemies I have not seen from rooms I have not entered track me down...what amazing magical skills do they use to find me several rooms away that they didn't have prior to the patch?.

Solo missions are now unplayable on any but the easiest level, and XP isn't on those.

Also, Funcom, when I do survive the first room, what is with NEVER getting a mission token?   Unless my chance is at 100%, no token...haven't had a mission under 80-90% yet and no token in the last 10 runs).  This seems to have started with 14.0 patch.

FireC @ 4/22/2002 6:54:32 PM (New bug with MP summoned weapons/ possibly with DOTs in general? 21550):
I have had some occasions lately when I've killed a mob but not got any xp and no loot rights, it just disappears right away. Today my summoned weapon once again did cast a dot (yes they do that even if people say they never see it, at least mine does) on the mob and that dot was the last thing to hit the mob - I got not xp or no loot. I think that's what happened the previous times as well.

This has never happened to my other characters, but I know that one time I was doing a team mission with a doc who used to cast dots on the hardest mobs, and sometimes we got no xp from the kills. I wonder if it's always been like this, if it's been changed lately so that DOTs are seen the same as acid pools (outside damage) or if it's a bug.

Anyone else bumped into this problem?

Scorus @ 4/22/2002 10:00:46 PM (QL 109/119 nanocrystal bug 21599):
Here's an odd bug for you. When pulling missions, ql 119 nanocrystals pull up as ql 109 and ql 109 nanos don't come up at all. I sat at a mission terminal for a long time pulling up ql 109 missions. During this time I never saw one of the dozen or so ql 109 nanocrystals. But I pulled up several normally ql 119 nano crystals as ql 109. These included Executive-grade Secretary droid, Prolonged Interrogation, Brave Challenger to (something), etc. I even did a mission for the droid and got it. The ql on it is 109 yet the ql on the one in the shop is ql 119.

I checked several other nanos from 90-116 and all of them were correct. It seemed to only be the 119 and 109s that were affected.

All Mobs are green (yellow, actually) at least - no greys.

If I did raise the impression that I am going for missions with grey MOBs/NPCs I want to apologize and clarify some things.
I never did a mission below difficulty 1.1, what means that most to all MOBs are green or higher. As a (non-OE) Engi at level 50 with my lvl57 pet this is still no problem.

It still holds true, that greys reduce the chance to get a token (they add to the total number of kills you need, but are not counted in the end - own experience).

Closing in at the 120 token board. 

So long,

On pet pathing - there is a GAMEPLAY BUG in the Worm-type mission dungeons.. 

This isn't quite as severe for 'crat as MP's or Engies, but the pets don't make it through the mouth of the worm into the first room (less severe for crats, as we can mez and also nuke).

It strikes me that this is a *severe* problem for engies and MP's however..

Physical redesign of the mouth would do it.. make the lower lip sloped so pets can get thru on either side of the "tongue"

RedSonja @ 4/23/2002 11:53:11 AM (20463):
Hay, no problem 
It's just I thought maybe after the 14.1 patch they may have "accidently?" re-introduced the bug where a mission containing four or five grey MOBS netted you a token no matter what your level was - if that was the case I was going to go report it, but I obviously mis-read what you were saying.

If you are token chasing nothing is better than entering a mission to find only five "blobs" on the radar and them all being green.
If you are XP and/or item huinting then I can't think of anything more annoying

nah...

Just let the pets cheat.. - When a pet can't see whoever it's supposed to be following/healing/fighting, you can just warp it back into range (instantly).

A quick fix for this specific scenario is pointless when pet pathing sucks everywhere..

Bump......

Taronas @ 4/23/2002 10:31:30 PM (Mission trouble 21828):
I'm new in AO but this happened now twice to me:

I got those missions where you have to get an item , those little boxes on the ground ...

Now, in earlier missions I picket the box up (or the content of that box) and mission solved.

But with the last two of that kind I picket the box up and --- nothing (

i killed some more mob and left the mission area with that item in my backpack but the mission is still in my list.

Any help?

Sabkor @ 4/23/2002 10:42:26 PM (21828):
You probably inadvertantly got a item return mission (I think the icon looks like a U instead of the eye over the box). This means you have to return the item that you picked up to the mission terminal that you received the mission from. (This is also why no-one does these types of missions  )

Taronas @ 4/24/2002 8:21:24 AM (21828):
Oh great!! 

Now, at least I got some experience and money fro cleaning up the mob. And the Item I foud was quite worth keeping it anyway 

Thanks for the explanation.

And I'm going back to reading the tutorials again ...

Also, what's their value?

Many Thanks,

Cordus @ 4/24/2002 4:02:48 PM (Adventurer Damage shields :( 21970):
Okay, let me start by saying that I am fairly new here...

That being said, why does the Adv Jacket of Blades (or any other low level damage shield) abosorb damage with every hit on first fight and nothing after that? 

For instance I cast Jacket of Blades and start fight and routinly see, "You absorb 20 melee damage. Soft Enforcer hits you for 10 damage." 

The next fight against a soft torpedo I only get "hits you for xx damage."

What gives? I shouldn't have to recast a shield inbetween every fight.

Cloudeh @ 4/24/2002 5:18:35 PM (21970):
Hmmm , read.

This shield will also absorb the first 30 points of melee-based damage that would otherwise be inflicted upon the target. However, the damage absorbing mechanism used is known not to work well with other methods used for absorbing damage. 

As for higher Absorbs and Enf nanos, Once I am hit for the amount, even if it another person it wont absorb.

I have to recast for each mob when soloing, sucks ;/

andthensome @ 4/24/2002 9:26:57 PM (Mission generator - getting a 3rd mission 22024):
I cannot get a 3rd mission a lot of times for some reason.  I have played since retail release and know how to get missions, that's not the problem.  Ever since 14.0 a LOT of times it won't let me get a 3rd mission for some reason and it's ticking me off!  I hate how they introduce new bugs with each patch.

Also, this crap about getting more variety of missions each time you get one up to 3.  I liked it the old way where you set the mission sliders to a certain setting and then got what you wanted, now it takes away one of the types you want and replaces with a different type you don't want after the 1st mission you accept; and it does this until the 3rd mission you try to get you only have one selection of the type you want so you end up spending money and time trying to get the one you want.

Put it back the way it was and fix the bug I mentioned.

THEDEACON! @ 4/25/2002 1:45:39 AM (Important Message 22075):
This is a call to action.
This is a call to action going out to every profession on Rubi Ka, every player that has a shred of decency, every player with a heart.  Because when it all comes down to it, behind the fancy nano armor or the senpai coats, we're all people.  As awful as we are to each other both in game and in the real world, there lies a spark of divinity, the angel upon our shoulder, the conscience that gives us pause and calls us to help our fellow man in his time of need, whether it's clan, Omni or neutral.

For months I've silently watch the Anarchy Online message boards and read about the plight of the Fixer.  Personally I've never played as a fixer so much of what I have to say comes purely out of ignorance, but speaking from the heart, I feel awful for what fixers have had to go through.  I feel awful for every time I've overlooked a fixer in favor of another profession and I'm disgusted at myself for ever, EVER charging a fixer for any of my MP buffs.  I can sit here all day and tell you how much my Metaphysicist heart goes out to you or I can, for once in my selfish AO career, do something to help.

I've read many posts telling fixers to simply reroll as something like an MP and let the matter be done and to you all I shake my head in disgust.  "It's just a game" you say, "get over it" you say.  I'm here to tell you that it's not just a game.  The most precious gift we have to give in this world is time, because it's the one thing we can never get back.  When you give someone or something your time, you give them a peice of yourself, a piece of your life.  Folks spend 100s of hours playing Anarchy Online, meeting people, making new friends, acquiring equipment, etc.  To ask them to give that up simply because the game designers lack the sense to properly implement professions is the worst thing I've ever heard.  Our characters on Anarchy Online represent a considerable amount of time and money spent and pissing it all away is sometimes not an option to us, as we lose more than we ever gain.

A fixer's one hope for excelling is in a nano formula which we've all heard of called "Grid Armor".  While the instruction disc itself is rare enough, the requirements to put it on are absolutely ridiculous.  From what I gather speaking to other fixers, all nano skills are dark blue for our speedy friends, which makes wearing grid armor even once the crystal has been made, something of a task.  Funcom as we all know is not exactly brilliant in their choices.  While grid armor will be given a significant boost in the next patch, the requirements to wear it are still out of control and with the upcoming changes, fixers will no longer be able to store multiple GA pieces in the bank for later use, as their nano skills will be too low to wear the armor.  That, coupled with the fact that SMG guns are horribly underpowered is enough to make many of our fixer friends leave AO permanently. 

What can we do to help?  This next part goes out mainly to Metaphysicists, as we will soon be the crutch that many professions will depend on even more than now.  Our Mocham's Gift line of nano buffs gives +140 to any nano skill and lasts a full hour.  Normally a high lvl MP will "sell" these buffs for around 50-100k each.  I do feel this is a fair price, as it reflects our time and costs in acquiring these spells and the time and effort spent to lvl up enough to use them.  Engineers mainly want these buffs to bring out extremely big bots many times their own lvl.  I have no problem with that, as more time, effort and money spent SHOULD equal better results.  But the likes of Fixers, Nanotechnicians and Adventurers care less about being uber, they only want to survive.  They only want to be on equal playing ground with the rest of us, to be an asset to the team, to succeed!  Your cries to Funcom have been ignored or mishandled and they will be in the future as well.  Funcom is far too arrogant and incompetant to make decisions that will help one class without seriously damaging three other classes at the same time.  But we don't want to lose our fixers, adventurers and NTs, so heres what I propose (and I hope this will start a trend to the community):

All Metaphysicist buffs for fixers are now free for ALL fixers, Nanotechnicians and Adventurers, regardless of affiliation.  While I'm often unavailable or in a mission, I still encourage anyone in need of help to call on me when you need a hand with implants, buffs, etc.  You will never pay me a penny for anything, not even a grid armor or nullity sphere disc, and I absolutely mean this.  We all deserve to have fun in the world of Rubi Ka, despite the hand that has been dealt to us and we all deserve to be playable classes.  If we're ever to change anything in this game, we have to stop shouting at each other and make one big noise.  Together.

To Funcom, take this seriously, as together we can do alot to ruin your idiotic nerfs, leveling difficulties, etc.  Imagine my ql 189 heal pet on a lvl 13 fixer and you'll know what I'm talking about.  You want to make fixers' nano skills dark blue?  Fine, I'll buff them with expertise plus Mochams' gift for a quick +160 nano skills boost.  And that kind hearted Doctor and enforcer over there will hopefully boost their HP.  Perhaps the wealthy trader will perform a gratis wrangle for our fixer friends, but I understand that's a more difficult request, as there's a bit more time and effort that goes into casting a wrangle.  

While one person can't do a whole lot, I'm asking that we all come together and help these professions until a fix (if ever) comes about.  In the meantime, I invite you all, clan and omni, to ask anything of me if you ever meet me in a town, outpost or in the middle of nowhere.  You will all be treated as brothers, despite the position that Funcom puts us in.  I only hope that other will follow this idea and take 10 seconds of their time out to help as well.  

I bid you farewell and wish you all the best.

Sincerely,

TheDeacon
lvl 128 Metaphysicist, Rubi Ka 1

Well, it works like that without the timer.. Just do some searching for a battlesuit.. 

However, if they really are worried about the amount of bandwidth it takes to autobuy missions, because of the time it takes to open the mission, read through it, maybe look at the reward a bit, and then move on to the next.. I can completely understand.  However, that should be an easy fix, just put a delay(n) at the end of the if...then statement..

Melbringi @ 4/26/2002 5:45:21 AM (Wierd visual bugs 22312):
Sinse 13.8 i and several other players i know using GeForce cards have been getting really funky visuals.

In first person camera view pastel shaded polygons will flash across the screen while running through high count areas like cities or places like the avalon desert. Sometimes these shapes will totally block out everything from view.

In third person view most often when wearing tank armor though not restricted to tank the character model will attach points to points in the environment. so a point on the shoulder pad of medium tank will attach itself to a corner of a building streching out the polygons on the char modle sometimes obscuring view just as bad as the problems i have in 1rst person, probably acutally is the same thing.

sinse the 14.0 graphics changes i have started memory leaking much faster than i have, the problem has never been fixed per say its been slowed a great deal but now its gotten worse again, i can only zone  3 times across city areas before my frame rate begins to drop, before 14.0 i could zone 6-8 time depending on population in the zones before noticing any type of a problem.

im running a 1.4ghz pentium with 384 megs of ram and a 32meg AGP NVIDIA GeForce card, i shouldnt have to restart the game every 3 zones and be subject to stray polygons.

These type of bugs are the exact kind of bug that could be easily preventable if the test server population where reflective of the live servers. Make playing on test with copies of prime chars a reality so testing can really happen.

No lie... when I fire, sometimes I'll see the Parry float above their heads (you know.. the one players never get?), and my shot won't do damage.  Is this an adventurer nerf (hehe), or just an all-around mess up with ranged weapons?

Also, I've noticed that sometimes when right-clicking an item more than once, the game will drop me to desktop.  Very weird, and completely unpredictable.

A friend had that problem for some time, most of his bags turned to no name items and if he died he could not reclaim them. For him the fix was to reinstall AO once again and *not* use that one big patch that has quite a few of them put together but to download all the little patches and then use those. Seems there is a bug in that big patch and it creates serious graphics problems for at least some people. Not sure if this will help you at all...

Federot @ 4/26/2002 6:15:14 PM (20355):
Flashpoints are notorious for this.

The issue stems from using the weapon only for specials.  No one actually shoots a flashpoint, heh.

Try it with any low clip weapon that has a special.  Fire only specials until it is empty, and you can't manually reload it.

Ctrl-F8 cycles through 3 camera modes in 3rd person view. One is a floating camera, one is fixed at the same angle and range you set it. Can't remember what the 3rd is cause I never user it

Zyxlquith @ 4/28/2002 2:50:03 PM (yalm/yama bug? 22646):
I've bug-reported this and put a similar post on the trader boards already... 
Let me preface this post with the warning that I've been without internet the past month and only logged on to AO last night, but in that short time I think I've encountered a yalm bug...

This is an old bug , of course, the un-equip yalm but be stuck in the yalm bug. However, it seems to now *only* effect people who use yamatachi range increasing scopes.  (that assumption is based on asking folks who have the same problem if they use the scopes)

further observations:

when unequipping the yalm, whether i do so by equipping my yama (done when inv. is full) or by simply clicking on the yalm, it leaves the hud1 slot, but i am still in yalm. I can then equip my yama and see it in hud1 but am still in yalm. only zoning fixes this

unequipping the yama-scope before equipping the yalm seems to help the situation, but I have not tested this much yet. Is anyone else noticing this correlation between yama-scopes and the "help-i'm-stuck-in-my-yalm" bug?

I bug reported it a couple months ago Cos..

Maximilian @ 4/28/2002 9:14:08 PM (20463):
Thanks for the check Cosmik.

I can add some ingame info.

-> 1) Short missions.
I did some 'statistics' during my last sessions. I can confirm, that you (I) can get a token for a misssion with five MOBs in it. After I killed the 5th MOB, the counter jumped directly to 100% and I got my token. In a couple of other (short) missions, I could confirm, that the counting process (probability to get a token) starts with/after MOB number 5.

-> 2) Rearrangements. Every time I die (and I do this much to often  ) the content of my implant backpack (implants and med suit) rearranges happily -> unhappy Vermeer. No biggy.

To add to the queue.
4) Pet bug. I entered a static dungeon (not mission) in Clon**** mine and lost contact to my robot pet. It was present and followed, but did not respond to any commands. Had to log.

5) Very bad bug. Right after this incident, I got attacked by Omni guards (Vermeer is Omni). Lost 50k XP to this. Grrr. I once read about a pet bug, where you and your pet loose affiliation after some unclarified events - happened already twice to me. I don't like this one.

So long,

Windrunner @ 4/28/2002 11:51:55 PM (22319):
No no no... I didn't say that I parried with my pistols.

I said that mobs parried my bullets. 

Sorry... didn't mean to be confusing there.

I think it's really dumb, and should really be fixed... especially when I get that mob who parries 5 of my shots and really gives me a hard time. 

Besides, players can't parry bullets... (not like they parry anyway)

Ashuras @ 4/29/2002 3:56:53 AM (20463):
Max, I've done lots and lots of missions like RedSonja. Had 460 tokens (during the 1 mission = 1 token days).

My conclusion is.. minium to get token = 4 non-grey mobs. Even greens count.

Also, opening chests counts as mobs too.

I think the program counts the number of time u GAIN XP. It's probably a bug. But I've done missions with hardly anymobs, but with enuf locked chests.. I still get the tokens. (eg. 1 mob, 3 locked chests).

Haven't tried it on 14.0 yet, I haven't got small missions yet. (only one with ZERO mob and ZERO chest = no token and no xp.. it was a full xp mission... sigh.)

Ashuras @ 4/29/2002 4:02:53 AM (Mission BUg.. or Stealth Nerf ? 22718):
Anybody tried this ?

1) Get one missions for Reward "X" (X can be anything).

Try getting another mission for same reward "X". Click accept. 

U think u've got 2 mission ? Wrong... only the 1st one is there. 2nd one disappears.

2) Get a mission of type "Y" (any type)
 
Try getting another mission of the same type. Where there used to be 3 of the type "Y" available to choose from.. now there are only 2. 

Take another one, and u'll be left with ONE when u click on generate mission with exactly the same settings.

A typical example is everybody's favourite setting of MAX MONEY, MAX BAD (those observe item missions).

THe above 2 changes (or bugs) were not mentioned in the patch notes. Would like to know whether they are BUGs or just stealth nerfs (since not in patch notes).

Federot @ 4/29/2002 5:36:18 AM (Mission terminal bug 22728):
When getting missions from the terminals, I generally get my first mission I select and hit accept for.

While browsing for the 2nd or 3rd mission, when you hit accept sometimes you actually get the mission you chose, othertimes nothing happens. (Terminal window goes away just as if you had cancelled it instead of hitting accept).  No mission in missions window, and no confirmation message about receiving a new mission.

Has been occurring since 14.1

-Yense

Maximilian @ 4/29/2002 7:58:11 AM (22718):
-> 1) I will have an eye on the reward problem, that sounds like they've overdone it a bit (how to get 2 sleeves of the same type and ql now, my dear Developers? - no we won't go for the mission and come back afterwards, it's our time).

-> 2) Mission type. Although there is no official confirmation (to my knowledge), this is 'intended'. The exactly reasons never have been clarified or published (Funcom - could you?), but this was known from 'Test live' before 14.0.
For the get/watch-item-missions it works exactly as you describe. You pick one and get one less in the selection screen. In case you selected 2 you will get only one to choose from. I can confirm this only for get-item-missions.
Another detail: This mechanism looks only for the mission type - it doesn't matter, what slider settings you use.

Not much help, but some info.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Maximilian @ 4/29/2002 8:24:12 AM (20463):
Hi Ashuras, haven't seen you around for a while - nice to meet you again. 

(Un)fortunately I've done most of my missions with Max, my neutral Adv, so I didn't care about tokens. Since a while, he is parked (-> Adv patch ...) and so I started Vermeer, an OT Engi, in 13.6. As he is Homo nano, I am rather anxious to get the highest token board possible (-> HP), 120 by now. This means, I did mostly missions since then.

Talking about short missions and token reward. I am pretty sure, that before 14.0 (13.8), I did get a token, even if there were only three MOBs in the area. It didn't work for one or two, but three did fine.
As Engi I invested in Disarm as well, and all but 1 trapped chests/doors in Vermeer's life were disarmed succesfully (nice XP and going to be even higher after 14.2). 
According to all I have heared/read so far a couple of things changed with 14.0. Unlocking and Disarming no longer counts towards the chance to get a token (at least not visible). But the rats, you get from some traps do count, if you kill them -> you can get 100% without killing all MOBs in the area. And they reintroduced the lower boarder of 5(4?).
Since my level is above 50 now I do not get very small mission to often now (even grey cave missions have between 7-12 mobs).

I hope my observations hold true - open for discussion.

Looking forward to a statement from Cosmik - hope dies last. 

So long,

Max(imilian)

Heheh.. I got sick of AO for a while.. and went to play Dungeon Siege. 

That game's graphics is amazing... AO should adopt it for indoor areas 

I can't honestly speak for 14.0+, coz.. ehhe.. got my 1k board.. so now token is not a top priority.

Then again.. recently I've switched from doing Money missions to Full XP missions, and these require a Token in order for me to get my XP reward.. sigh... and I was so lucky to get a mission with NO mobs.. (those doing money or item runs would be damm happy for them).

I have Engineer Twink too. Level 42 I think. Got sick of watching the pet fight and sitting back. (ADV fight is close in and intense). So he's on hold for now. 

Nanomage Engineer.. hmm.. not sure if it's a good idea. Sometimes u need to fight or do pulling... especially if u solo and face rooms with multiple mobs. Sending your bot in = 2 others come for u. So u'll need the HP to survive.

Maximilian @ 4/29/2002 9:52:03 AM (20463):
Darn, you were again faster than me.  I just downloaded the Dungeon Siege Demo and want to install it at home - read a lot of good things about - how is your impression?

Oh, we are on an AO board, jaja, I come back to the topic. 

-> Missions and reward. To get your XP/token now, you have 'ensure' a minimum number (5?) of MOBs per mission area, otherwise nada. I too often encountered grey cave type mission with 3 or less MOBs in there and didn't get a token(XP) - sigh (at least the money matters at Vermeers level). Though I have to say, I like this rule. Would be nice to have some more knowledge about mission setup, but what we have is a start.

-> Engis: Cough, cough. Ya know, old brother, Max is neutral, I like to be neutral and so on. But, Omni-1 is a great place to go shopping and prices are, let's say, better for OT folks (it makes a difference, especially in the lower levels). And one thing, Max for sure can't do, is making implants and other use of the trade skill compartment. So, what came to my mind - an OT Engi. I wouldn't call him a Twink, he is well equipped - I seldomly equip something I can't put in on my own, but I am quite efficient in implant switching by now.  Nevertheless, got a trader and MP as friend ... .
Homo Nano. Actually, I thought the Nano Pool would be larger, I based my thougths on the old 4/3/3/2 rule, but wrong again. So far, no major problems. I wear 3 up to date HP implants plus board, not enough for a fight on my own (above con green) but my bot makes up for it. Trimmers are quite effective if used properly.

What puzzles me a lot, is that outdoor hunting is fun with Vermeer but almost impossible with my Adv - wrong world in my eyes. Just don't miss the right time point to leave the scene if things go wrong. Once my bot got aggro from 8(!) muddevil salamanders - man they stick together.

So long,

Max(imilian)

RedSonja @ 4/29/2002 10:21:25 AM (20463):
There were numerous rumours and confirmation that the number of locked chests and the number of rooms you visit in a mission also contribute to the % of getting a token.
This may have been the case, I found it difficult to confirm that as I always went the "kill all the mobs route".

However I'm more than convinced this isn't the case now.
If it was then in theory as I enter a new room my % count should go up.
Every time I unlock a chect my % count should go up.
Unfortunately it doesn't.

The only thing that increases that % is killing mobs.
An interesting note is that the rats found in some chests also count towards your %.
So, if you have a mission with a lot of rats in you can in fact reach 100% before all the mission mobs have been killed.

Ashuras @ 4/29/2002 10:30:39 AM (20463):
Referring to the rat example.

As I said.. I think there is a bug in the code.

Instead of counting actual mobs killed, they count number of times u get more than 1 XP, taking that as an indication of killing non grey mobs.

This is why opening locked chests (not sure about doors) counts towards getting token.

Replying to Max...
OT mode on:
-----
Dungeon Siege is a brainless and linear monster bashing fest. It's fun to a certainly extent.... and the eye candy certainly never cease to amaze me. U sould see all the different armor, flaming weapons, freezing opponents shattering upon death, beholders, dragons, castles, snow scapes, lush forest, deserts... etc.

Endless. It's the only thing out there that can compare to AO in terms of graphics now.

That is why I said AO should adopt it for indoors  and learn from DS in terms of camera control in 3rd person view. (AO's 3rd person view is a major headache in enclosed areas).

DS is a good side dish to complement AO when u get sick of all the mission running, static dungeon camping, etc.  Especially good when AO is down for reboot or patching

There are invisible walls in many places after 14.0.

Example : West Athen, just west of the bank.

Unless you hug the city wall you walk into an ivisible barrier when moving west.

There has always been annoying invisible barriers, esp in Tir when flying, or when flying over certain mountains...when you cross from "mountain" to "ground" it is frequently impassable.

But after 14.0 new invisible walls popped up where none used to be. And we're not talking zone borders but way inside zones on walkways etc.

Int/psy has always been scarce in shops. Your best bet is trying the shopping chats.

Also, while getting items should never be a reason to join a guild, keep in mind that one of the side benefits of being in a guild is sharing of items, of all descriptions and qualities, to those who need/can use them.

Most higher level int/psy users have several bags of int/psy armor but if they are like me they keep 95% of it in their guild, since it is hard to get in shops.

But your main reason for joining a guild should be wanting to be a part of a bunch of cool people who hunt/party/do events together

Mist0 @ 4/29/2002 12:27:11 PM (Pet pathing please : ( 22771):
I just want to know why at Funcom, despite of the thousands post about pet pathing, they haven't done anything.

But I dopn't want to be the one who complain only to complain, I offer solution :

1 - Making a /pet warp command which will teleport the pet in the area next to the player. I think it's the easiest thing to do and that will have no impact on the gameplay exept that it will make the pet class happy to play mission again

2 - Making the pet follow the master more closely and at the same distance in evry situation while using the /pet /follow command. The pets don't need any path finding, just set them to follow the master path like if they were blind. 

3 - Make the pet able to pass trough wall or at least trough table and stuffs.

I've given solutions, now what I expect is an answer, if those solutions are not suitable or you are not able to implement that for any reason please tell us WHY !!!
Else please tell us when one solution will be implemented !

Scorus @ 4/29/2002 2:32:01 PM (21303):
I make it a habit to mainly fight human mobs in missions, so my experiences have been mainly with that type of mob (OT and neutral). But several other crats have reported this problem on the boards and so I think it is a problem with the interaction of mez and charm. Ask on the crat boards for more specifics.

At this point the standard crat advice is to let your pet hit the mezzed mob first and then charm it. But while this work-around is sufficient in a lot of scenarios, a fix would be all the better!

ok if you have a room with 2 doors going onto the main room and both are locked, and you unlock one, you still can't go through that door, you have to go and unlock the other one as well !

RedSonja @ 4/29/2002 5:05:34 PM (20463):
"This is why opening locked chests (not sure about doors) counts towards getting token"

But that doesn't make sense.
If you open a locked door you also get more than 1xp, so that too should count.
At no point after opening a locked chest have I seen the message % increased of getting a token.
More so, opening chests should mean that you can get to 100% before killing all the mobs, this is only possible if you kill rats.

I'd love to see an official word on it, but as it currently stands I'm 99.99% sure that locked chests do not contribute towards the percentage chance of a token.

Checkbit @ 4/30/2002 4:57:52 AM (22728):
AHA!

I knew I was'nt seeing things.  Glad to see I'm not the only one having this happen.  It does'nt happen all the time, but always seems to happen when trying to pick up the second mission (for me anyway).

Checkbit @ 4/30/2002 5:01:34 AM (22802):
Along those same lines... I've had times where one door would open (not showing locked) and even fought a mob in the doorway.  However I could not cross the threshold of that door until I went and unlocked the other.

Checkbit @ 4/30/2002 5:13:24 AM (22319):
I've seen both of these bugs as well.  I decided to dust off my agent, roll into a mission, and see what havoc I could cause.  Imagine my suprise when that Hardened Bully  said "Parry" in big green letters to my rifle bullet.


Also, I have noticed on all my alts that when attempt to pick a stubborn chest that if I right click alot of times in rapid succession that my client will crash.

Cosmik, is this right click thing part of some safegaurd put in to squash the illegally stacked item/macro massive levels exploit?  If so, could you kindly go rattle the cages where you keep the codemonkeys (no offense ladies and gents, I'm one myself) and tell them to increase the allowed click count.  (Assuming that is what this is from, and that was the fix)



onrightclick kill -0
onlogin kill -9
onzone kill -0

(sorry, had to poke a little fun)    =)

Checkbit @ 4/30/2002 5:33:10 AM (21117):
Yeah Cosmik, I've seen it but not to an extreme.  About the only time I notice it is during team missions.  And then it usually maifests as my teammate running through doors without them opening.

On occasion though, especially when a mob runs out of targeting range (no longer appears on map) because of some AI pathing hiccup, I wont see any damage messages the rest of the fight.  However the very next mob I fight I'll see a flood of damage messages at the first hit.  This happens indoors and out.  And I am pretty sure I can reproduce that effect with some degree of success.  A good example is to go to the SE mines in the Mutant Domain.  Target a mutant that is up on top of the mine (the hillock surrounded by wooden beams) with a ranged shot.  Often it will run over the top and down the other side, killing line of sight and leaving your map display.  You will stay in combat, but you no longer see the recharge bar for your weapon.  After a few seconds (sometimes minutes) the mob will path back towards you.  At the moment it comes into range you will see a flood of damage messages on the mob (none to yourself) and combat will -usually- continue as normal.

You can also try this by standing as far west of the bronto drover (at Harrys) as you can and still target him. Fire a shot and run out of his range, yet staying close enough that you keep the "fence" in range.  After you snipe at him a time or two, he will head east back towards his "resting" spot.  He runs back and forth like that so long as you are not within range of his weapon.  Here's where it gets buggy...  You will stay in combat... but you will no longer continue to fire.  Even when you try to hit "Q" a couple times to reset combat.  Sometimes you can break that by sitting, then restarting combat.  This bug used to haunt my agent in missions.  I use Harrys Bronto pen as an example only because you can easily reproduce that bug.  This may have been fixxed since last I encountered it.  I've been -really- into the melee stuff lately so it's been a while.

Anywho, hope my 2 cents helps somewhat.

Checkbit @ 4/30/2002 5:39:11 AM (22646):
It happens with Kodiak cars as well.  I generally switch out of my car by equipping my range extender.  I say usually because it seems 90% of the time when I get attacked while driving to a mission, I can get out of my car.  I know you are not allowed to get -into- a vehicle while in a fight, but it apparently wont allow you to get out either.

However, it does make for some interesting game play.  The other day I was taking my enforcer out to the eastern part of Omni Forest.  I get "such-n-such is attacking you" and think that what the heck, it's grey anyway. I'll just deal with it.  Suprise, I cant get out of my car.  Eventually I killed it.  Actually, it would be more accurate to say it committed suicide against my damage shield.  Go figure.

Can anyone confirm that these mission are still bugged?  I wasted an hour on one this morning only to be attacked by the person I was sent to find.  The strange thing is that both myself and the "found person" are Omni.   I tried calming him and waited a good 10 minutes with both calmed and after-calm effect on the person, but the mission would never complete.

  If these missions are still bugged is Funcom gonna get around to fixing them some time soon?  I remember reading that they were bugged months ago on the boards but figured that they would have been fixed by now.  It is not fun wasting time heading to these mission only to find you cannot complete them.

Anyway, does anyone know if there is a work around to get these mission to work?

  Bloody thing cost my yam. fund about 70,000 credits between the cash reward and item I did not get.  I can only imagine how PO'ed someone would be if they were to take one of these missions into some of the more remote areas of the game or if they were to lose experience because a death.

if you are putting in a feet imp then you will have no problem, what they fixed was people were putting in high ql shineing treatment head imp to get thier treatment up to swap it with a head imp, which they didn't meet the reqs after the imp was swaped. they didn't make it were if you had a treatment head imp in and was putting in a feet that your treatment bonus wouldn't count from the head imp, if that is what you are thinking.

Well go buy a lockpick for heaven's sake! And if you don't have the money, kill some leets or rats or something until you do.

If you still absolutely can't do this, then delete the missions that have the first door locked. You do a right click on the mission icon then drag and drop on the red X to delete the mission.

The higher your break and entry skill is, the fewer attempts you will need to unlock something. But you still can unlock it eventually, you just need to be patient and just keep using the lockpick over and over until it works.

Not quite true, higher level you are less chance you have ever getting anything open if you've not raised the skill. My MP level 102 has the skill up to 200 (and then some, can't remember) and she's not able to open chests too easily in level 112 missions. Go a bit higher and she can't open them at all.

We were doing a team mission tonight and all was going smooth as silk.  Until we got to the Boss Room.  We were at 99%, and jumping in we only saw one target; the boss.  So the six of us start tearing into her, and I mongo (was the meatshield tonight) to keep her off the healers.  All of a sudden we start taking raditaion damage left and right from multiple Chaos Minions.  Huh??  The boss was the only mob on radar.  


Long story short, we enlisted some slayerbot handlers to deal with this, and once we were able to get back into the room (sans boss now) we see two chaos minions sitting there.  The mission owner grabs the item to complete the mission, and boom, both minions drop dead.  Apparently these things were -behind- the walls before, with no doors or other means of access to the room... and they were still wasting our team left and right.  To clarify, there were no other rooms either.  These things were attacking us from "the void" around the room.

Just curious if anyone else has run across this one yet.

RpTheHotrod @ 5/1/2002 6:59:06 AM (21512):
Okay.

pet's get stuck in corners, and every single door if going into it at an angle. They also get stuck on tables, and sometimes, if you have them follow you, they run AWAY from you, out a door, and go all though the map taking long routes just to enter the door you were heading into. In other words, if you kept running, you end up walking into your pet that went another way into the room ahead.

skybert @ 5/1/2002 1:09:57 PM (23009):
yes, treatmen implants is still usable.
You put one in, and it raises your treatment skill.

What you probably are talking about, is the treatment implant EXPLOIT they fixed not long ago.

I've also tried reinstalling.

I haven't gotten any response to the email I sent either.

The ARK was very friendly in game, but unable to help.

My vehicles are in there! And God knows what else, it's been so long...

Please help. Not that you care about my measley $12.00 a month, but this is the sort of thing that will cause me to reevaluate my subscription.

cold @ 5/1/2002 2:15:05 PM (16701):
What profession is everyone this is happening to ?

It happens a lot with my adventurer, but never seen it with my trader, fixer or doctor.

If I try to pull mobs to the first mission room it almost always goes wrong and others aggro me from several rooms away. This does not happen with my team members.

Also, often I get aggro for no reason. Other teammembers can already be in the room with the mob, I go near the door and the mob will attack me. Or sometimes, when team has already hit the mob, and I have done absolutely nothing yet, the mob will target me anyway. Especially trader mobs aggro me often. Weird. I'd like to know what's causing this. Is it a nano I'm running ? An item I have equipped ? Or just the fact that NPCs hate neutrals ?

megaram @ 5/1/2002 5:30:59 PM (23132):
I've noticed this a few times... but in regular mission (team & single player) rooms...

I get aggro don't see the mob but and am not able to attack back except for regular pistol attack. Specials don't work, nukes dont work (except for AoE). Team members can't help me either... if this is happenning to a team member AoE nukes do help If i get close to wall and cast on self.

My fix is to run for exit... and come back in and mob will be visible on map, usually between 2 rooms... either avoid that area or if you are daring try to pull the mob into a room from the void and then kill it. (works best with healer as bait)

"remove chairs and things pet get stuck on...."

You might wanna remove all walls, doors, shelves aswell ....
Since the pets are now totally useless when used inside.

Why not make a /warp command (or something ?
The command makes the pets pop up right beside you (and not run off like to usually do ....).
This command must work alwyas, with NO glitches .....

(What ? Did I hear the the pet pathing issue will be resolved when version 16.2 gets out ? .......)

I get a stuck in Yalmaha bug and I dont even know what a yama scope is.  So no, I dont have one and yes the bug is present without one.

I click the yalm the unequip bar rises to the top , disappears but I am still in the yalm.  If I try to unequip again then I get a message telling me I cannot do that while polymorphed and I have to zone to get out of the yalm.

Then when I have finally got out I am six inches tall.  But I expect you have all found that already.

There are plenty of other bugs with yalmahas like the one where it will not point upward and you can only fly along the ground unless you re-equip.

Besides, players can't parry bullets... (not like they parry anyway)  
			
		
	
I know you didn't say that. But if I can parry with my Krutt, there's no use in worrying about whether the mobs are parrying or not. I'm sure they can parry whatever evade your gun checks against, and vice versa. But mobs get superhigh parry and we don't

I have one of those in my bag. And have had since about 13.6 or so

Its got some stuff in there

Before the patch it was always a blue blob in the bank. But i could remove it and when it got into my inventory it would turn back into a bag

Since then whenever i try to remove it, it looks like it dissappears from the bank. But never appears in my inventory. And when i reopen my bank its still in there (as a blue ?)

Before the last patch:  After casting the creation nano, you were reduced to 1HP.  This was just like normal damage and had to be healed by using kits/nanos/heal pet.

Since the last patch:  After casting the creation nano, you *look* like you've been reduced to 1HP.  However, your actual HP has not changed.  Simply Shift-Click yourself (or target yourself and press "T")  to force the client to double check your HP, as it pulls up your character info from the server.

Same goes for anyone else in the vicinity or in your team.  Personally I don't mind this bug - I'd rather take imaginary damage than real damage any day!

When you cast your creation, press F8 and look at yourself. Then Shift-left click YOURSELF and your HP will return to normal.

Hope it works for you

Eh...bump!  The lack of official response from Funcom is quite disturbing on this, with Cosmik's response (thank you Cosmik!) the only thing we've heard back since in, um, January.

C'mon Funcom, can't ya just leek out where you guys are at with this?  I understand the hard work that went into getting this beastie up and running (yes, I was an orginial first-day subscriber who put it down for a while due to severe frustration with it and I've since come back).  However, maybe make the receipes and components 0 dollar items on the test server?  That way folks could try out the combo's and tell you where the broken ones are at (well okay, so imo they're probably 90% busted, heh).  The scuttlebutt has always been that Funcom is fixing this, but we never hear anything more than, uh, soon.

Anyway, it's 110% better from the first 6 months of launch, but I think this is some low hanging fruit you guys could snatch up easy like and make players even more happy with you.

I just wanted to bump this before I stopped reading this thread (I'm getting pissed again, couldn't get past page two ). It's really really sad that we have to resort to a tactic like this, surviving when a fvcking bug strikes, instead of *actually playing the goddamn game* and not having to worry about it.

Mist0 @ 5/3/2002 8:42:56 AM (22771):
Well, as many people quote, the /pet warp command could be an issue if it is exploited so, what I suggest is to enable this command only in missions and static dungeon. There is the only place where pets get stucked anyway.

I believe in you Funcom, I believe that you will make this game enjoyable even for the pet classes.

tiitii @ 5/3/2002 9:53:23 AM (22728):
yep, getting frustrated by this

also, have problem where pick up item, and location of mission changes

e.g. i chose mission in SAV with reward some nano, and pick up was omni-pol elite sleeves

press 'Accept'

now, mission says it is at Longest Road, reward is same useless nano, but pick-up item is no longer sleeves, but some useless cluster i dont want!!

if you're like me and u camp missions forever to get a battlesuit mission, or some piece of armor you really need, it pisses me off to hell when either a) i press accept and dont get the mission, or b) press accept and mission i receive (location, reward, or pick-up item) has changed from what it originally said in description

my gut feeling is funcom has been trying to prevent us from using AOMD to make our lives easier, and has instead added some bugs to the mission generating process

rant off

tiitii @ 5/3/2002 10:04:49 AM (20341):
frustrating...

tiitii @ 5/3/2002 10:19:22 AM (22024):
one solution for your second problem:

instead of clicking 'Cancel', change difficulty setting (slide it to max hard, let go of mouse, slide back to setting you want) 

it will let you request next mission, without having to reset sliders again, AND it wont change the type of missions

small time saver, hope that helps

e.g. choose med-hard difficulty, set sliders on max bad/max money, request mission

not mission you wanted?
DON'T PRESS CANCEL!!

simply move difficulty slider to different setting, let go of mouse, now you will see 'Request Mission' button again, set to difficulty you want and press Request to get 5 new missions of same type you originally chose

Bionitrous @ 5/3/2002 4:04:39 PM (22024):
I'd like to know what the bug is regarding the first point as well.  I've wasted upwards of 20 minutes twice surfing for my third mission only to accept it and have nothing happen.  

If I knew what the situation was that stopped me from getting the third mission, I'd avoid it or settle for two.

I relogged, and when I came back, all was back to normal again, and I could tank mobs again.

Very frustrating - I don't use AOMD and have to search manually to find a mission in the right place/with right reward (especially hard as I have no Yalm, so some zones are certain death) only to have the mission disappear completely.

Please funcom, you are in essence nerfing pet classes by NOT fixing this issue.
MP's, crat's and engineer's all agree that pet pething is horrendous.
It is in need of overhaul.
Some people say MP's and crat's are too powerful, well...not if they can't even control there own pet(s). mp's and eng's have fewer hp too, so we are not as great as tanks as other professions.
i have a 142 mp and will be taking matt met out to afford to pick up a weapon and not have to rely on my pets.
kinda sad huh? cant even use my own pets effectively.

hobbes @ 5/4/2002 9:13:47 PM (Playshift failure in Delirium 23763):
Strange I have only had this problem in Delirium, but it occurs almost every time.

You cannot exit the mission without putting your mission key in a backpack. Otherwise you are zoned out of the mission, then back in without ever being able to move or heal.

This is really a problem when you are fighting something tough in the first room. You put key in backpack, zone out, heal, remove key so you can re-enter, re-enter, put key back in backpack while fighting, etc......

Next @ 5/4/2002 9:37:56 PM (User-definable hotkeys not suppressed in chat 23768):
Some of the user-definable keys will execute the hotkey when typed as part of chat, instead of just being typed.

For example:

I go to the OPT panel, and click on Keyboard options. Under the "User definable keys" section, I map "1st/3rd person" to the V key. From now on, pressing V will toggle the camera between 1st and 3rd person, as expected.

However: when I press enter to open the chat entry box, and type the emote "/wave" or I say "How have you been lately?" to a friend, the camera also toggles when the V key is pressed, even though the V in this case is just part of the word and not intended as a hotkey.

This doesn't happen with all keys; movement keys and the default sit-down key are correctly suppressed when used as part of a word in chat. But many of the other keys are not correctly handled and execute as a hotkey when they are not supposed to.

On another related note, I know that "Fixed keys" can also be configured by editing the text file, but that is not what I'm talking about here. I'm talking about "User definable keys", which are designed to be customizable, so they need to be fixed so that they work properly when customized.

Also, I think that more of the fixed keys should be made user-configurable through the user interface, with this bug fixed, to allow for greater flexibility in customization for different users' needs.

Isaah @ 5/5/2002 1:53:54 AM (21195):

What the hell is with these pets starting to attack other groupmates when the owners die?! That crazy **** happened just a second ago and cost a couple of mil worth of xp to the fixer in our group because everyone else was so 'amazed' by it that they just stood around with their thumbs in their asses wondering what the hell was happening.

I'm a pet user, and I can damn sure tell you that this crap better not become commonplace or I'm out of business in this game! If after a pitched battle our group is beaten a bit but survives (and I happen to die) I can almost guarantee that my pet is going to take down at least a couple of folks if it starts this bull****. I spend a great deal of time and energy keeping my pets buffed and summoned as high as I can get them, tell me now that suddenly that is a detriment to my group instead of an assett...

THEDEACON! @ 5/5/2002 7:01:58 AM (23810):
Pets do not aggro people when you die.  What happened was someone decided to be cute and attacked your pet, or they attacked it by accident.  Happens all the time, yet nobody ever admits it, because they die 95% of the time and are too embarrassed to admit they died doin something very silly.

The worst part is, they blamed you for what happened to them and perhaps even booted you from the team for something that was neither yours nor funcom's fault.

THEDEACON! @ 5/5/2002 7:08:13 AM (23486):
No, what's even better is when MOBs teleport through walls and kill you.  I get a kick out of that one.  I sure wish my pets could do that....or go through an open door for that matter

Pets will agro people when their owner dies. I've seen this happen twice personally and heard it from other engies/mps. In a group with two engies, me being the other engie, we lost the other engie, and his warbot started going around attacking people in our group. Not only did we have to contend with the warbot, but we had to kill whatever had killed our engie... 

Actually I kinda like this. Its sort of poetic justice =\ The way to stop your crazy pet is to either kill it, or bring back the owner quickly, course with two engies this is usually a possibility ^^

Vydas @ 5/5/2002 9:25:49 AM (23844):
This is related to acid, but it's not the only condition that causes it to happen - it's the damage over time element, I think, that causes it.

I say that because in an office mission, if a mob dies from a damage shield, you don't get experience all the time, either.

Yes, very odd and annoying bug.

Checkbit @ 5/5/2002 9:31:31 AM (22728):
I -may- have a work around.

When you accept a mission and you plan to grab another from the same terminal, same type, and to the same destination... put the key into a backpack.

So far, I've been doing this and I have not seen this bug again.  That's not to say it cant happen, it just has'nt happened for me yet, whereas before I could make this bug happen everytime.

Of course, make sure you put the key into your main inventory when you go -to- the mission.  There has been trouble in the past about keys held in packs not letting you into the mission until they were placed in the main inventory.


Hope this works as well for the rest of you.

Right now there's no real benefits of being an atrox, except being able to use a beam and da taunter (and looking really stupid in a thong =).

I don't have the numbers, but I'm pretty sure the difference in HP between atrox and sol is no more than 50-100 with maxed abilities, and the difference in nanopool is more like 1K.

Atroxes should have more HP than other breeds at the cost of less nanopool.

Just for further information (more is always best), are these invisible MOBs of any particular type or types? Or, just any old MOB will turn up invisible?

Also, are these MOBs invisible after you have run away from them previously, or they just come out of nowhere?

Cosmik @ 5/6/2002 6:39:24 AM (22954):
We'll look into this (zoning back into a mission area even due to 'the slightest twitch'). Has anyone else been affected by this?

I'm a little confused by your first statement however. You are saying the only missions you can find are in Tir County? At what level, and where are you getting the missions from?

andriaaa @ 5/6/2002 6:54:34 AM (23810):
I saw this happen once, but it was no big deal to me then, because we had two engies, one clan, one omni.. The omni one died, and his bot attacked the clan engie's bot. The omni's bot died and nothing further happened..

Oh yes got this bug a few times, petitioned about it once and ARK told me to put my key into a bag to get out like I should. Happened to me in Aegean and in Perpetual wastelands. Also know friends who have got this in various zones, at least I know what to tell them now when they ask me.

So Cosmik you have no rule for ARKs reporting bugs like this, eh? They obviously seem to know how to temporarily fix it already.

EDIT: and I think he means this bug has only happened to him only in that one zone .

Cosmik @ 5/6/2002 7:20:10 AM (23914):
Yes, this is a graphical bug that has existed for some time. It usually happens with certain types of armor and cloaks. It is something we hope to fix, but due to its severity, it isn't a big priority right now. Nonetheless, its a bug and it will be addressed as such. I'll see what can be done about it. Necks aren't meant to bend that way.

Also had mobs TELEPORT from god knows where to previously cleared rooms.

To Cosmik: I think the invisible mob are just invisible and nothing more. I haven't noticed anything that could trigger monsters to be invisible. Seems like it just happens once in a while.

Had this problem just last night in a grouped single mission in BS.

Tank was making some long distance pulls, by the time he was in range the mob was invisible, impossible to target without /assist and finally showed up after it died.

Happend a couple times, both humanoid type mobs, not sure if they were the same or not.

Nanogater @ 5/6/2002 12:15:45 PM (Lost items ! 24023):
Played my 103 MA (Atene) on friday, got killed in a mission in eye camp, north of 20k. While waiting on items at reclaim terminal in 20k, AO crashed. Went to bed... 

Logged back on on saturday, still waiting on my stuff. When items was finally reconstructed in reclaim terminal, half of my stuff and bags where gone.  

Sent petition, but after 1 hr waiting and still being #31 (same # I got when sedning the petition) in the petition queue, I logged off. Got a 'Sorry you where not logged on' msg from an ARK when logging back on on sunday. Sent a bug report by mail to FC-support, not answered yet. Maybe I included to many other issues ?

Darkbane @ 5/6/2002 1:00:11 PM (22954):
I've had this happen in Omni-Ent on testlive. You zone out of the mission. If you stand still, then you can sit and heal. If you move in any direction, even forward away from the door, you zone back in.

When you zone out, you appear to be being put 'behind' the zone border, and as zone borders are bi-directional...

The Omni-Ent missions in question were ones with the door deep into the building so you walk down a sort of tunnel to get to the door.

Other mission funnies are cave entrances in cliff sides which sometimes appear out of place. You get to the mission location and can't see the entrance, but if you move *into* the cliff, you'll be able to walk into it, and the mission entrance will then become visible. I've also noticed that once you've been in the mission and come back out, the entrance appears correctly (not sure if this is the mechanism, it may be that the time of day is different or something else entirely).

Darkbane @ 5/6/2002 1:19:17 PM (23763):
As I posted in that other thread, it *appears* that you zone out of some missions 'behind' the zone border for the door, or on it. And it doesn't matter which side you cross a zone border from, it only zones one-way.

When you accept a mission and you plan to grab another from the same terminal, same type, and to the same destination... put the key into a backpack.

So far, I've been doing this and I have not seen this bug again.  That's not to say it cant happen, it just has'nt happened for me yet, whereas before I could make this bug happen everytime.

Of course, make sure you put the key into your main inventory when you go -to- the mission.  There has been trouble in the past about keys held in packs not letting you into the mission until they were placed in the main inventory.


Hope this works as well for the rest of you. 
			
		
	
I get this bug frequently too.  Unfortunately, the key in the backpack trick has never worked for me.  Seems to be random as to whether or not I'll get 2nd or 3rd mission on 1st, 2nd, 3rd try, etc.  Really frustrating when I try to pull a mission for a rare item that I need and the terminal window vanishes with giving me the mission.

Fishtaco @ 5/6/2002 3:52:49 PM (23810):
people are getting creative with this one, I had a guy first tell his bot to attack mine then terminate... fluffytech was the losers name, anyway there is some kind of agro going on with pets that dont have owners anymore. the problem was fixed awhile back but seems to have creaped back out again... I have seen lots of people die as of late from ld enggie/crat/mp owners, I dont hesitate to kill a pet if the owner ld's unless its a slayer  
now that I think about it, the last time this happened I was in a team at the MBC and the enggie went ld 1/2 into a fight with bullie,  ... after we killed the bully " pet was still fighting bully, after owner ld " I guess the pet had some extra agro going becuse it turned on the closest person to him, killed that person

Aristaeus @ 5/6/2002 4:36:49 PM (23486):
I run regularly into this problem.

As a doc when I can't take on a mob I DoT & run through a set of connected rooms waiting for the first aid block to go away. I need to this carefully since the moment I lose the mob on radar there is a chance of the mob getting stuck in a corner or on a door. If that happens the local & server side location of the mob have a good chance desyncing. The server claims it is next to me and dishing out damage. My client claims there is no mob (thus no line of sight) so I can't hit back. 

If I survive this due to the mob dying to the DoTs, not me zoning, then there is a chance that the next mob I attack generates a list of damage that I've done to the invisible mob (but that never registered on my client).

It doesn't matter what type of mob, have had it happen with traders, enforcers, agents, doc mobs.

Bionitrous @ 5/6/2002 4:58:21 PM (23486):
Here's one way to make it happen:

As an MP send your attack and mezz pets into a room to attack a mob and start hightailing it to safety.  Of course the mezz pet makes it to the monster and your attack pet runs to the other side of the mission.  So your mezz pet dies in four hits and now the MOB attacks YOU.   So you start to run to the entrance because your demon is off in lala land.

Next thing you see is 'Attacked by -NONE-'.  Then you may get messages 'You were for 389 damage'.  Note the syntax on that message.  No indication of what is killing you.

Then you die if you can't make the zone because you have nothing to target to use your root-symbio or CoC on.  Then you get pissed off and come to the boards.

Txxx @ 5/6/2002 5:37:29 PM (22954):
Cosmik:

Check with your ARKs.  I had this problem several weeks ago in Delirium.  I petitioned and an ARK named Harpster showed up quickly.  He seemed to know all about it and claimed that I could determine if it would be a problem by looking at the mission entrance (though I no longer believe that this is true).

The Delirium mission just immediately zones you back in, you do not need to move.  A location in 4 Holes zones you in behind the "zone line."  So you can sit and heal but you cannot leave.  If you move any diurection you zone back into the mission.  

BTW, nice advice about putting the key in a bag.  I was just deleting them.

st0rmkr0w @ 5/6/2002 5:39:44 PM (23768):
I'm also having this problem.  I too have 'V' bound to switch between 1st/3rd person view, and it's irritating when it switches views while typing messages that contain V's.

I'm also having problems with my key config.  I use the 'FEDS' config (E is forward, D is backwards, S is strafe left, F is strafe right) opposed to the default 'WADS' config.  Whenever I hit D to go backwards, my character keeps going backwards until I press another button to stop.  Can you look into this as well?

spookiepants @ 5/6/2002 5:41:29 PM (23619):
I have the blue=helmet problem as well.  I've reported the bug twice to Funcom and have not received a fix, nor have I even received a reply.

LuNanJen @ 5/6/2002 6:57:08 PM (Another Bug 24067):
Anyone noticed the bug in the FC- Player communications?

Symptom: When ever player finds a bug, or comes up with a great idea fix or solution and posts it, nothing is ever heard about.

Probable bug: Obviously no sane company would ignore their customers so the bug must be in the line between FC reading or posts and in the reply.

some one should look at it.




p.s. We are not beta-testers. Though we all seem to be being used as such.

CoreMP @ 5/6/2002 7:06:42 PM (24023):
Same thing almost happened my friend. He died and w8ing for reclaim for over 15min yet no items. All he still did have was the items that he had looted since the time we started fighting.

GM Turned up after I petitioned for him because a trick to getting GM's to actualy give a sh-t about players petitions is to 

/petition IM STUCK 

and this will get their attention instantly. Seems like players who have POS problems get responses faster than players who have some MAJOR frikken problems.

Hope this petition works better. I know I always do it because I am sick and frikken tired waiting 2+ Hrs on a petition just to have the frikken game crash and petition whiped!

yeah my demon went bezerk once when i died in a team mission.
I could see the screams of my team mates as the demon swiftly killed 2 of them before the doc realised what was goin on and started healing the enforcer.

Same thing happens when you get killed in the arena and are saved nearby, the pet will go crazy and start killing ppl and do full dmg.

Lunera @ 5/6/2002 7:53:26 PM (Superpowered, invulnerable mobs!! 24076):
About an hour ago, I was walking with my level 15 MA, when I spoted an ultra green Fresh OT Assassin, I told myself, easy kill, nice credits. I run  toward the mob. He spot and start shooting. He shoot once and hit me. He shoot again, and it me again.  I am already noticing something is weird cause I have all my evade maxed. I finely get in fighting range, and start punching the mob. I miss. The mob shot me, and hit. I punch again I miss again. Then i really new something wasn't normal. I keep punching the mob, missing every singles time, while the mob keep hitting me every time he shoot. Things go on like that for a moment, until I my life is pretty low. I chain cast personal heal, And I continue punching (or I should  say not punching) the mob. I keep missing every time, and getting hit evry time. I finely run out of mana, and I run to the zone exit (it was really close thankfully).  Once safe I heal myself, the refuel my nanobots, and I recross the barrier. (I know I am curious). I spot the mob again, and he start shooting at me again. And it’s the same thing all over again. I miss every single punch, while the mob hit me every time. I fight for as long as I can (I am very stubborn), and after a second nano pool emptied with heals, and maybe another 50 miss in a raw, while getting 50 hit in a raw ( on a green mob, I remind you), I gave up and decided to come here.

I would like to say, that this game killer bug, is in a no way a rare one. It has happen to me since my level one. Except I had never before realized just how bad it was, because I have been extremely lucky. Usually things happend like that, I spot a no-aggro mob. I run to him and start punching him hitting nothing but thin air while the mob keep walking as if i didn't even exist. Usually I would give up telling myself it must be AO version's of ghost mob. Nothing too serious. Except this time it's the mob who attacked first, I couldn't fight back. If it had been an orange mob, I would have been in serious trouble.

Anyways I will sealing for the land of Morrowind tomorrow, so I’ll be unviable for the next 3 months. Hope every things will be patch by then.

WookiHog @ 5/6/2002 8:41:42 PM (Warning 24082):
Do not carry anything of any value on your character.  I died in a mission last night.  No biggie, happens all the time.  however, after picking up my remains, I noticed that both of my backpacks loaded with nano crystals, future weapons, cloting, devces, Robot trimmers ALL GONE.

Nakomis @ 5/6/2002 9:02:33 PM (23486):
Hmmm...  I too have had a similar problem.

The worst ever was when I was in a solo mission with a team.  We were in the first room, and the tank was doing long distance pulls like you said.  Well, this particular time, an extra mob came running out from one of the surrounding rooms as well.  So, since everyone else is killing the enforcer mob, and nobody has bothered to mezz this new guy, I figure I'll get him to halfway or so by the time they are done.  So I start attacking.  

Five minutes and a whole lotta first aid kits later, the mob is dead by my hand and my hand only.  Nobody else on the team could see him, even though he was right there, and had been the whole time.  They couldn't even /assist.  They did however get the experience from the dead mob, and they could see my health bar dropping while he was attacking. me.  

This has happened several times, mostly on mobs that were firing pistols.  They were all solitus male mobs, with blonde hair and beard.  I have no idea if that means anything, but you never know.

It is very very very annoying to have to have your team chain heal you for seven or eight minutes because you have to kill a real mean by yourself.  Please look into this.

There is something fishy about this, but I do not now what.

I've seen this a couple of times too althoug I may think some funny guys tends to attack it first.

(I trust my bot to do what I tell him)

Thyrra @ 5/6/2002 9:27:53 PM (23486):
i've noticed the problem a few times, most of them recent.  

i think this is an issue with the 'mirror door effect'.  the others posting about moving around the missions seems to bear my theory out some.

it is indeed a bit daunting when you are the only one fighting a mob and the rest of the team is just standing around wondering why you are losing health but won't ( can't ) help you.  

same goes when i'm the one wondering why a team mate seems a bit anxious at the -huge dot- ( invisible mob ) the picked up from somewhere.

WookiHog @ 5/6/2002 9:32:47 PM (24023):
Same thing happend to me last night with my level 45 Eng.  Two of my backpacks and half of my items didnt show up at the reclaim station.  I am very pissed off.  That stuff took me a very long time to acqquire.  It's gonna cost me 400K to replace.  Granted I only have 70K.  This really sucks since I needed those items for level 45 - 55.

What does the /ppetition function do and how do I use it?  What did you guys and/or your friends do?

Silver @ 5/6/2002 10:20:06 PM (23810):
I have only seen this when the team is of a different political view than the pet.

For example my pets are clan because i am, but my team can be neutral and that is when it happens a clan pet will attack a neutral team if the opponent of the team is clan.

Isaah @ 5/6/2002 10:31:01 PM (23810):
You're wrong on that Deacon... Not only have other players been the victim of MY pets, but I have been the victim of other pet users 'mad' pets. And I damn sure didn't attack them, as a matter of fact the fight had been over for about 10 seconds and we were sitting around getting Nano back up and waiting on the MP to get his belongings and rejoin us in the mission. And the second time it happened to me personally the Bureaucrat's pet came attacking me from completely across the room while I was arranging items in my inventory while the 'crat got items out of the reclaim term before he was summoned back.

Feydrutha @ 5/7/2002 1:31:16 AM (21085):
i've used both with great success..

auctionbot cause it has a functional auctioning system.. sure it spams the channel with useless items.. but then the people who want to sell those items would spam anyways, it's really up to the users...

omnibot has an even better feature: you can ask it to watch for certain items, and it will forward to you tells on the shopping channels with those items in the required qls.. so it doesn't bother anyone and it actually allows you to have your next set of armor/nanos ready to use without ever having to sit in trade for days at a time... since it went down i simply gave up on having the best possible armor...

Nanogater @ 5/7/2002 8:16:35 AM (24023):
/petition [insert msg here]

type in your problem, then an ARK/GM will come and ask you about your problem ingame, if u're still logged on.

Use '/petition help' to get more info, and '/petition status' to get info on how many petitions are waiting in queue before you.

To use 'false' petition like 'I'm stuck' when you are not should make ARK/GM just ignoring you for at least 1 week, IMHO. It is just as bad as sneaking in a RL queue.

Tried petitioning for the second time yesterday, unfortunately AO crashed (again) before I could get an answer.

Varsel @ 5/7/2002 10:49:47 AM (Doc-MOBs casting puny dots 24186):
I'm back in the game after a 3 month break and I've noticed one thing (among others).

In the missions the docmobs repeatedly cast primitve viral agent (a 3dot) and Infect wounds (a 21 dot). And that is from mobs orange to me at lvl79. Actually I've never been hit by a higher DoT since I came back.

The only debuff I do on the mob is the init one.

Or maybe it's because I'm a collegue

Not that you had 2 mobs of the same type in different rooms and you went after the wrong one?

Well. Bring'em on.

But this wasn't about the agent DoTs. My main point is that I usually got hit with 80-90 dots before. But now lvl90+ Docs have started to cast ql10-20 DoTs.

Bionitrous @ 5/7/2002 3:05:26 PM (24186):
Yeah, they execute the 3 DoT right before they land the 219 or 300+.  Might be something with their nanopool.  See them do it alot and I don't complain.  Nothing worse than when they start going into Complete Heal mode or decide to drop that 200+ DoT on three seperate peoples.

Hi!

I managed to talk to Quaseem about it (he's the guy creating the bots), and he told me he had a problem where the auction data was corrupted and decided to fix it up before he brought it back. 

He said it would be back this week, and hopefully the new auctioning system would be implemented by then too. Also, the speed should be alot better now, although the popularity IS somewhat of a problem (it had more than 10 000 users apparently).

WookiHog @ 5/7/2002 5:48:25 PM (24023):
I emailed FC and they have responded.  The guy was actually pretty cool.  He asked me my location, item list, etc.  "It has been forwarded to Software"  I'll let you know the outcome.

Aristaeus @ 5/7/2002 5:56:56 PM (23486):
Had basically the reverse happening today.

Fighting a bully, I hide behind the pillar in the cavern room to stay out of sight of the other door in the room. Suddenly the bully takes of through the door I came in. By the time notice it is not coming back but intending to move to the other side (and out of radar range) of the mission I run after it. I find the bully 7 or so rooms back, I get messages that indicate my DoT is still functioning, I can't/don't attack with the guns I am dragging around due to no line of sight, but I can hit the guy with the DD nano I lug around. During this time it takes me to kill the bully using the DoT & DD I don't get attacked.

Bionitrous @ 5/7/2002 6:06:52 PM (23486):
If the source of this problem cannot be fixed, then at least a sanity check needs to be added in.  Client can simply say to the server "I see you are telling me that I'm getting hit and I believe you.  But, from my view, that' impossible.  Please tell me the real deal"

This should tell the server to resend the coordinates of all attacking beasts to all team members.  Dirty but simple.  Sanity check is done client side and a request for resync is only done when the client notices that things just aren't right.

Personally, I'd be happy with a simply 're-sync' hot-key.  Used to use this in UO and it comes in handy when you know things just aren't right.

Perhaps, the next time this happens, try the Shift+Lft-Click trick on yourself and/or the affected persons.  If it works for the MP creation weapon bug, maybe a forced reload of character info would help here as well.

Wahoo. @ 5/7/2002 6:10:42 PM (Nano Resist 24242):
Ok my enforcer "littletotem" has 1115 nano resist with rage running.

Cause he can't! His nano skills are around 670 ish.

He can resist low level dots and a few random generals.
Most of the general debuffes will not be countered.

Serena @ 5/7/2002 7:44:41 PM (24242):
Nano resist is pretty much usless unless your a mob... Kinda like the mobs have maxed inits and weapons skills as well and some *STILL* have insane AC like soldier mobs and Enforcer mobs.

Bionitrous @ 5/7/2002 10:08:05 PM (24242):
Doesn't matter what the level of the nano formula is.  It could be a lvl1 or a lvl200 nano and the resist formula is the same.

Take for example an NT nuke that has an attack skill of 100% MattCrea and defense skill of 100% Nanoresist.

The check that is made is the NT's MattCrea versus your NanoResist.   If these two are equal then he has a 75% chance of landing the nuke.  The key point regarding this post is that it doesn't matter what level the nuke is.  All that matters is the Attack Skill vs. the Defense Skill.  I'd guess that with a NanoResist above 1100 you should notice yourself countering SOMETHING.

Next point to note is that some nano formulas use other than 100% for the Def Skill.  Some use 75% Nanoresist as the defensive skill.  In this instance you only get 1100*.75 or 825 to defend against the nano.  825 is easily obtainable for my MP as low as lvl129.  You got an insane amount of nanoresist and I'm still gonna getcha 3 out of 4 times.

The reason people say nanoresist is broke is because it has no effect on the results of a nuke even after it lands.  Most people would expect it to work more like evades where even if you DO get hit, you aren't going to get slaughtered if you are paying attention to your evades.  

Most people expected nuke damage to be reduced to the lower end of the scale and roots/snares to have a shorter duration if they paid attention to Nanoresist.  Fact is, if the nano lands, it's doing whatever it's gonna do whether you have zero or a million nano resist.  Couple that with the fact that even insane amounts of nano resist still let in about three quarters of all nanos and you see why people say it's broken.

Shylara @ 5/8/2002 12:08:09 AM (24023):
Just FYI, it has been standard FC policy that they do NOT replace lost items, XP, or credits.  Even if it was a bug in their code, even if you have screenshots proving that you had the items, and such....they won't do jack about it.

If you do get something returned, please post here...and give the name(s) of the ARK/GM/DEV/whatever involved....it will set a precedent and a LOT of people who've lost stuff will riot...

Cloudeh @ 5/8/2002 12:48:33 AM (24242):
A level 75 NT can still root me and always root me and anever fail when Ihave 1k+ NR and he has around 400/500 MC I think.
That is with rage.

If i maxed NR to say 700 or 800, rage for 800.
Thats about 1600, does it help with 1600 nr? no?! Yes? 

Someone?

Isaah @ 5/8/2002 8:06:40 AM (Ok, what the hell is THIS type of damage... 24339):

 Now this may not be new, but it damn sure is new to ME! How in the hell does Funcom manage to keep ****ing up the stuff that aint broke, I mean hell... how do problems like this just 'appear' without someone dicking aound in areas of the programming they should probably have left alone?!

pets never attack the team unless they are provoked. 99% of the time it's the enforcer mongo'ing that triggers it.

LOL

Isaah @ 5/8/2002 12:33:18 PM (23810):
Well being an MP I highly doubt that I'm able to Mongo... and since sitting and regaining Nano and health is a far stretch from attacking a masterless pet I doubt very much that anything I was doing at the moment can be construed as 'hostile' toward the pet. As for the times when it was MY pet attacking the group I cannot say, I was well on my way to the reclaim terminal by then, although no one in the group saw any combat messages prior to the pet attacking them. As for saying "Pets never attack the group...", well knowing for a fact that you weren't there for any of the scenarios me and my groups have reported, I wouldn't throw the word 'never' around too liberally...



[Edit] I wanted to throw in an issue that just happened a few hours before this recent server reset... Me and an Engineer friend were fighting the Blaster Beetle in Varmint Woods again (we've been doing that for at least 10 or 15 levels off and on), I'm an MP, while fighting the Beetle I picked up aggro and was killed, while waiting on me to get back my pet began attacking HIS pet, my friend began to send me messages asking me what the hell I was doing and so forth. I told him to take a couple of screen shots, and send a petition so we could get someone to look into it. After my pet killed his guardbot it just sat there and timed out, it did NOT aggro onto my friend like a mob would normally do if you issue a /pet attack command. I thought this strange and worth posting since a few of you all are Engineers and my encounter this at some point.

Look what this cosmik promised long ago. and nothing really happend, people are even more screwed since 14.0 or 13.8 in mys opinion...

Cosmik cosmik i known after 1 week that i am absolutely right with my opinion....

danserinthedark @ 5/8/2002 3:46:26 PM (24242):
I'm pretty sure the damage of nanos are reduced based on your nanoresist.

I could be terribly wrong, anyone?

On more thing yesterday i noticed my lev 45 ma had 5 in nanoresist. I have over 100 in psy so i should have about 40. 

Have anyone else seens this bug? stat bonus not getting added to nanoresist?

Shuntz @ 5/8/2002 4:25:08 PM (19215):
Any ideas?

Anyone?

Pluteaux @ 5/8/2002 7:44:19 PM (Very, very, very slow response to petition 24430):
I send a petition, and see that "There is 25 petitions in front of you in the queue." Half an hour later there still "is" 25 petitions ahead of me. After an hour and a half, there "is" 24 petitions ahead of me. So, there is only one person answering petitions, and he takes a couple hours answering each one, or what?

My lvl 45 enforcer is stuck in a wall in a the mission in Upper Stret East Bank. All mobs are dead, but I haven't found item to pick up yet (searched mission several times and got stuck in wall looking for possible secret door). Now, I'm going to have to terminate, lose xp, and come all the way back to Upper Stret East Bank if I want to continue looking for item and get my QL 66 NCU memory as reward. During the time I've been waiting, I could have done another mission for the credits to buy an NCU memory upgrade.

I'm wondering under what circumstances it would actually be worth the wait for petition help.

By the way, it's 2:30pm EST on a Wednesday. Is it just a case of everyone being asleep? Is there a certain time of the day when petitions get answered in a reasonable time period? I would think at least a few of the petitioners ahead of me would have given up by now. Or is that why it's gone down from 25 to 24? Someone ahead of me gave up waiting?

It's probably been over 2 hours now, and I'm still 24th in line.

Please bump if you think petitions are answered too slowly.

Thehardway @ 5/8/2002 7:56:15 PM (24430):
Petitions can take a long time depending on the the cases.

However in all my playing time if I(or fellow player) sent a petition where they clearly said that they were stuck in some manner the ARK's were quick to respond.

Being stuck is high priority, and usually gets answered swiftly.
Also the ARK know that it is usually a quick process to remove the embedded individual.

Just make sure that your first words ar "I'm Stuck. Please help."
Add whatever info you feel the need to after that request.

Scorus @ 5/8/2002 8:45:10 PM (Bug creates best PvP rifle in game? 24442):
There is what I'm assuming is a database error on the rifle that drops in the Cyborg dungeon. Instead of targeting duck/dodge/evade, it is comparing its AMS against the target's assault rifle skill. So I'm guessing that crits against non-soldiers happen with a rather incredible frequency.

http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?cmd=view&id=153981

As antiguardians and HackersQuest agree on this, I'm betting it is correct.

Shylara, evidently no precendant is going to set.  The email tag I had goin with Customer Support has ended up as effective as the /ignore in the game (with me on the wrong end).

The best was the GM (i did a petition last night).  Basically Funcom has decided that their official policy is CYA (cover your ass).  And therefore, the guy clammed up when it was pointed out that this very rotten business practice to shaft your customers but in the end, "This will be fixed"  YEAH RIGHT.....


Point in fact.   I take back everything I have told my friends about this game.  Now I just say "not worth it"  FC's policy is to take your money and that is about it.  Their blatant irresponsible business practice is almost incredible.  At least an apology may have helped.  


Hey Funcom, when you screw your customers, at least have the common decency to give us a reach around.  Hell, I would've settled from some dirty talk instead.  Thanks for the waste of time.

Bionitrous @ 5/9/2002 1:56:30 AM (24242):
Damage may be based on nanoresist.  There is no chance of a crit however.

A 75 NT who goes in for PvP will probably have around 630 MattCrea.

Sounds like he'd be using Ball and Chain which requires 500 MC/TS.  630 vs. 1600 and I'd expect you to resist more than land.  If he lands more than 50%, then I'd say something is broken.

Even so, saying the calculations are accurate, I think it's kind of silly for 600 attack to beat 1600 defense half the time which is kinda how it's designed to work.

Just like Conceal is 'broke', Evades are 'broke', 'Attack Rating' is broke, NanoResist is broke.  Problem is that it is done as a deliberate game design.  If they made it work for non-Enforcers who get 600 NanoResist going naturally, then the Enforcers would become immune to all nano formulas.  That's what happened with Conceal.  When it used to work for Fixers and Adventurers, Agents became mostly invunerable.

If they fixed evades so that your NT could actually get missed half the time, then the Fixer would never ever ever get hit.

They have a serious design flaw in the 'to-hit' calculation code and it shows pretty badly in how poorly PvP plays out and how boring character development and PvM play are.  It is impossible to 'excel' in anything to a degree where you actually feel a difference unless you are in a profession that can increase this skill to an absurd level.  This means they might as well just eliminate this skill from the tree and make it an innate characteristic of the profession.

Then we end up with the same boring class-based system as most other MMORPG's where what you are good at is based solely on your profession.  The 14.2 changes push us even more in this direction of not being able to expand 'beyond your green skills'.

Evilspork @ 5/9/2002 3:25:01 AM (22728):
This started happening to me after 14.0, I noticed it the second day after the patch. At first I thought it was me being stupid (not a rare thing) and hitting 'Cancel' instead of 'Accept'. But after the second or third time of not getting my mission I started watching where I was clicking, and for sure, it WAS happening. Many times it happened on the first mission I was trying to pick up, so the key idea wouldn't work. I petitioned about it, and the ARK who answered was as flabbergasted as I was. He got all the info about what was happening, asked if it happened at more than one location (which it did, from Avalon to Tir), etc.

Get this one fixed!

Evilspork @ 5/9/2002 3:29:40 AM (22954):
This happened to me in Avalon, where the mission entrance was one of the mounds of dirt with a hole in it, like an ant hill. Luckily, it was just a solo mission for a token so there weren't any mobs trying to get at me right inside the door. For me though, it would force me to enter the mission again without even moving at all, I would get the "Entering Avalon" message, then a "Changing zone" message right afterward. After four or five rounds of that garbage, I just RD'd from inside the mission instead of flying back like I planned.

Evilspork @ 5/9/2002 3:33:41 AM (23897):
*bump*

Evilspork @ 5/9/2002 3:38:22 AM (23844):
It happens with the acid because all that time the mob was standing there taking 3 damage and immediately healing, it was counting towards damage to the mob. Once the total damage done to it goes over 50% (or whatever the percentage is) of the mob's hit points, you won't get any xp. Same rule applies to players, if Player A and Player B are attacking, and Player A does 50% of the damage to a mob, he'll get full xp while Player B gets little or none.

Doesn't mean the acid thing isn't stupid, though.

This bug just keeps getting worse and worse...

Tonight, I blitzed upwards of 25 missions... and this bug occurred over 10 times while I was choosing missions...  Imagine rolling missions for an hour, trying to get a super-rare item... then having the mission go *poof*  (Gee, that reminds me of several other things about this game...  ) For that exact reason, this bug has got to be stopped asap.  (Well, one work-around would be to put those rare items in shops instead of making us roll missions mindlessly, endlessly for them I guess.  )

The difficulty of a locked chest/door is based on the amount of xp you get for it. a chest that gives 555 xp needs IIRC  555 B&E to be opened in one try with 100% success. If you only have around 150 B&E (like I do) then the chance is 150/555.
I might be of on the base success percentage. That is the success rate at skill = difficulty.

Ok this is one i've been seeing complaints about all over the forums.  As far as i can see no one has posted it here.  Im not sure if this is the right place but with something this irritating i'd like to increase it's visibility.


1 out of 3-4 times you accept a mission, the missions screen closes and nothing happens.

Yes

That's right, one out of 3-4 times.  Just as if you cancelled.  Now your probably reading this thinking that maybe we are just pushing cancel instead of accept.  Nuh uh.  Nope, thats not it.  I have asked other people at the terms if it is happening to them and they say yes.  I've asked on guild chat (all lvl 100+ experienced members) and they have confirmed a frequency of 1 out of 3 or 1 out of 4.

Guys...  I dunno what to say to you.  This is just nuts.  People spend hours camping terms looking for just the right item.  I know it's an unforseen bug but i can only hope it has a high priority attached to its repair.  This is bar-none the biggest time waster ive yet encountered in this game.

lag-death = 5 minutes.  General lag and movement paralysis in BS/20k/newland accounts for maybe 1 minute per mission.  This mission terminal problem however:  20 minutes to 1 hour a pop.

THis is so not not not not NOT fun.  Please work on this asap.  I have great faith mind you, you have all done a great job on previous 'serious' issues.

(bump if this is driving you nuts and you actually happen to read this forum pls)

Zeroshift @ 5/9/2002 11:50:53 AM (24509):
This happens all the time ever since they brought down the servers.

It's very irritating because you lose a chance at a rare item due to this.

That was propably the point.  FC wants you to only do missions for clan application forms and maps.  They don't think you should be "shopping" for stuff in mission terminals.

Meligant @ 5/9/2002 4:08:15 PM (Soldier Nano bug - Please Fix 24539):
Here is the bug:

Titan Physique:  http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=29254

+416 Hit Points QL 113 (533 BM - 515 MC)

Survivor's Resilience: http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=95693

+361 Hit Points QL 139 (656 BM - 621 MC)

Maybe it's just me but it sure seems wierd that even IF a soldier upped his BM skill to use either of these that you would get penelized for raising it higher the 533 since the highest Nano raises your HP LESS.

Sounds like a bug to me.

PS - If a dev feels it necessary to double the HP increase values and hence making them almost useful while making this fix, i'm sure everyone would support the action as a good move.

On a side note:  Please either add the missing "0" to the 60 in this nano or just delete it. http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=29245  It is really silly to spend all that effort in a team of soldiers to only get a 6 pt reduction in damage for ALL those NCUs.

Thanks.

Jeamus @ 5/9/2002 4:26:37 PM (Hacked nano critters? 24542):
Are hacked nano critters bugged?

I have one that says it casts a 40-50 pt doc hot.  I thought this would be a really nice item to use in mez mission runs.  I hacked it with my hacking tool to remove the doctor only requirement and to lower the skills.  I meet the requirements on the hacked critters.  I targeted myself, and right clicked, the nano critter stack is reduced by 1, but no nano showed up in my ncu slots and I did not recieve any increase in HP, nor was there any visual effect of a nano going off.  The first time I tried this I thought I might not have had enough ncu left for the spell but, I tried it again with over 60 ncu left and it still did not work.

If these things are bugged, I guess I will just sell them for cash to a terminal or hack and delete them for the few extra exp points.

Sometimes when I log in or almost exclucsively when i get a mission reward upon completeing a mission Ill get horrible latency (i believe thats teh term) afterwards.

For example:  When In a find Item mission I pick up the item OR If its a deliver mission and I drag the item to teh mission booth, Ill get teh mission succesful message AND then horrible delay between when I move the cursor or press a hot key on the quick bar or my keyboard.

This did not happen on my other computer on a lan connection but it happens now at home on my cable modem.  This started happening after the server patch last thursday.

speardancer2 @ 5/9/2002 8:07:33 PM (23810):
On the serious side, the cause of this needs to be found, and if it's something intended, players should be warned.

Otherwise, it should be fixed.

Personaly, it makes me really glad to be half of an NT/doc team that usualy doesn't have time to group with anyone else.

LOL.  If you had to wait until level 180 to be able to cast a +400 HP nano your profession would be toast

This game should not make eveyone dependant on outside buffs.


Im sure Soldiers have enough hp at that level, anyway, if it does take that long, the problem is?

so your saying, if you have to be lvl 180 to cast it, it should be something good?

Well, give everyone something good, Engies get elite slayers!
Crats get uhh uhh uhhh uhh........O_o...

Angeleye @ 5/10/2002 7:47:52 AM (24542):
Don't think its a bug, its a hacked item and the desc usually says something about being "more unstable" - which means that sometimes the execution of the hacked item fails...

Jeamus @ 5/10/2002 3:58:58 PM (24542):
Thank you for the reply Angeleye. 

I believe you must be correct.  I tried it twice this morning after I ran out of heal kits and it worked both times.  The only thing I have ever hacked and used before are the pill kits and I never had one of them fail, although that was with another character along time ago.  Must either be something that was "fixed" to work as the description reads or I was just luck with that other character.  (Or I have forgotten  )

Roeg @ 5/10/2002 10:23:59 PM (21512):
I always just thought my pet was a drunk with attention defecit disorder. You mean getting hung up on any and all objects is a bug? Running into walls continously isnt a gameplay feature? I figured my pet was bad and was taking some "time out" in the corner. Or was a Moslem who had to face Mecca for a bit before fighting. Or was just a state employee waiting for the "Hostile Action Authorization" to clear. Or..

I had been naming my pet "I Cant Path" for a while. One day I looked over and standing next to my 'Crat pet was an engineer with a pet named "I am Stuck". Quite a pair.

I don't know if FC knows about this already, but since the new patch went live it is impossible to combine the 8 unique pieces in the Alvin/Dodga NPC generated quest.

I transferred 175000 cash and a ql 67 SA Confident gun to my partner. Almost immediately there was a system wide crash. The money and gun have totally disappeared.

We've tried zoning and re-logging - nothing. I've sent a petition - 36 in front. An hour later, still 36 in front. Will the ARK give me my gun and money back? Fat chance I would think.

One bit of money I will be demanding is my months subscription - I've had it. Goodbye to all who knew me.

Jayde @ 5/11/2002 6:26:45 AM (MA Spell Elusive Target cancels Sparrow Flight polymorph 24835):
Doesn't make any sense, but it does. =P

Last night, an MA friend of mine was buffing everyone with Elusive Target (evade buff) before a long travel via Sparrow Flight... When we went to use Sparrow Flight, it wouldn't allow us because "a better nano program is alrady running."

As far as I can tell, this shouldn't happen. What's the deal?

Kincain @ 5/11/2002 6:44:10 AM (Shop Item 24837):
Went to the Nano vendor today to get my new nano (Lesser Illusory Paralysis) and right where it should be in the list was the infamous "Blue Square w/ Question Mark"... possibly meaning my graphic for the nano is missing? It had a price but no shiftclick info.. I need my nano!

What are my solutions, or .. is this a known issue?

Krneki @ 5/11/2002 7:58:38 AM (24835):
The deal is that the higher skill requirement nano overwrites the lower skill requirement nano if they are in the same stacking line. It may suck, but that's how it works, maybe it will change in the future.

Exactly.  There is NO EXCUSE for this!!  I mean, when you click "buy" at the shop term, it buys the item, right?  When you click "accept trade" when trading, the trade occurs, right?  When you click on your special attack, it goes off, right?  

This is a frelling stupid bug.  This should be fixed before 14.2, not in 14.2!

If you are doing single missions, try this.  It worked for me, and I was having probs w/agro in single missions:

1.  Wait until only 1 mob is within site/range
2.  Pull mob to entrance.
3.  Go into the front corner of the entrance, so the mob has to turn from its "flight path" in order to attack you.  It should then stay in main room.

****D****
*......m....y*
*...............*
*...............*
*...............*
****E****

Kinda like that, where D = door to main room, E = entrance to mission, y = you, and m = mob.  The mob should be forced to turn around and move toward you a bit, thereby interrupting its flight plan.

Fine - flame me all you like. I feel so angry about this that a bit of flaming is the least of my worries.

On the assumption that Funcom might just occasionally browse these forums, then we need everybody who has suffered from these major bugs to vent their feelings.

Yes, you're correct of course, I have now been contacted by an ARK who was very apologetic but explained there was nothing he or Funcom could do.

For the sake of the sanity of the remaining players who have decided to persevere with this damned game I make this suggestion to Funcom:

Set up a separate "refund" petition line now - it'll avoid people like me clogging up the help system for players whose problems are obviously far more important.

Hmm, well, if you look at my post again you'll see I didn't promise anything. I said that we are actively working on pet pathing issues and still are. We know it's a big issue (I myself play 2 pet classes regularly) and are working at fixing it - but it's a multi-step process rather than a single foul swoop. As I said, one of the first big steps we are taking ot fixing it is removing troublesome furniture. Doorways are another issue as well. But we're working hard on fixing the pathing issues. I hope you'll see the changes soon.

Fix this or i quit, taking at least 3 accounts with me. and frankly as soon as the next set of games come out i don't think you are gonna be able to afford to throw away customers at the rate u have been doing.

Darkbane @ 5/12/2002 12:20:13 AM (21512):
What I find rather odd, is that missions are modular, built out of prefabricated components of fixed and known geometry. The standard method for pathing in such a situation is to incorporate path nodes into the world data which the AI can use to navigate. This prevents stupid behaviour such as getting stuck on furniture or doors. It does not help find the optimal route from point a to point b, but it does make the job easier.

Given all that, it would seem that, because pets and MOBs can get stuck on furniture, doors, walls etc, that AO does not use path noding. Is this the case, and if so, how exactly is AO trying to path? There are more dynamic methods, but they generally are fairly CPU intensive so I'd be surprised if AO was using them.

Any ideas anyone? Cosmik?

This is connected with the problems Ive listed below in the latency problem.

Not sure if it is latency, but ive discovered otehr people who have been having the same problems

http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?...start=29521483

But they are incorrectly guessing that it is a graphical problem related to the bit size of graphics.

As ive stated before, i get serious cursor lag in all city zones and most outside zones.  I get severe cursor lag (cursor AND buttons take a long time to respond) after i complete a mission, inside a mission or outside (deliver type).

I run in windowed mode (could be root of problem) and have a voodoo 5 64 mb with a 533 amd-k6 using 320 meg.

"Brown" Cave missions have the tendancy to be much larger.

But I have seen brown cave missions small too. There are several types of "Brown Cave" Same as many times of "Building" or "Omni Office building" Or "Underground Subway" style.

The only one that is really smaller is the "Grey cave" template. And even sometimes those can be huge also.

Kinkstaah @ 5/13/2002 5:25:24 AM (23897):
The Solitus has a better HP/Nano balance than any other breed (Has a bit more HP/Nano than the opifex as well)

It also costs more to raise all abilities (provided you raise *all* of them) than any other breed.

And if you are a soldier - You dont need nanopool. Atrox is a bit better there. Same with Enf. Beam rocks. As a solitus enf I very very VERY VERY rarely empty my nanopool.

Higher nanomages can cast slightly better nanos. My Solitus level 200 NT brother needs *6* points to selfcast Izgimmer's last word.

I wonder where those 6 pts would be if he was a level 200 Nanomage NT?

Cosmik @ 5/13/2002 6:04:29 AM (23897):
Yea, I've said it before, but I want to say it again. We are looking into making the breeds more diverse in the future (eg making Homo Nano more "nano"). So, keep your eyes and ears peeled for this.

Cosmik @ 5/13/2002 6:06:06 AM (24835):
The stacking suggestion is likely what's happening. I'll bring this up with the designer to see if this should be the case, and what can be done about it.

Cosmik @ 5/13/2002 6:16:56 AM (24907):
Well, I'm not too sure what fix you are asking for. The complete removal of brown cave missions, or a fix to fact that you are getting more brown caves than anything else?

As MiKEBoND said, there are a variety of brown cave missions, some larger than others, but even the larger ones can be very rewarding (more kills, more loot). These cave missions can also be the same size as other mission types. Describe the first room, and I'll know which one you are referring to.

Cosmik @ 5/13/2002 6:18:36 AM (25058):
Yes, I posted about this in another thread, and it's a known issue. Just for valuable information though, what types of missions are you getting, and from what terminals?

Cosmik @ 5/13/2002 6:19:54 AM (25040):
Yes, I've been a bit of this lately. I'll be talking to the team about this to see what we can do. 

For my information, do you experience this lag everywhere, or only in certain places?

Thyrra @ 5/13/2002 6:35:57 AM (25040):
the people i know report a huge difference in cursor lag between windowed and full screen mode; with windowed having the huge cursor lag.

i am running a g4 4600, 128mb ram right now and still get cursor lag and UI sluggishness periodically.  this problem has been getting worse with the recent connectivity issues.

i see the lag in misisons and cities.  don't do outside hunting anymore since there is a sore lack in hunting grounds; i can't speak to cursor and UI lag in those places.

Have you petitioned in game about it? If not, I would advise doing so. That way an ARK or GM can look into your org and if needed, fix any issues or promote you themselves. (Can your org leader promote others?)

The mission icon from your mission view disappeared? Did you still have the key in your inventory? And for further information digging, where'd you get the mission from, what type was it, and to where?

Maybe it's just me but it sure seems wierd that even IF a soldier upped his BM skill to use either of these that you would get penelized for raising it higher the 533 since the highest Nano raises your HP LESS.

Sounds like a bug to me.

PS - If a dev feels it necessary to double the HP increase values and hence making them almost useful while making this fix, i'm sure everyone would support the action as a good move.

On a side note:  Please either add the missing "0" to the 60 in this nano or just delete it. http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=29245  It is really silly to spend all that effort in a team of soldiers to only get a 6 pt reduction in damage for ALL those NCUs.

Yup, its windowed mode.

Everywhere too, city zones, outside zones, missions.  In full screen I have NO problem.  In windowed, its like moving the cursor through molasses.  Very slow.

Its not 16 or 32 bit either, I havent tried full in 32 bit though, but in both 16 and 32 bit graphics (1024 700 something) i get the cursor lag in windowed mode.

Syryx @ 5/13/2002 7:24:24 AM (25058):
well, since i was lvl 12 i always used max bad/max money only sliders and have never ever used different combo's

This always yielded 3 pick up item missions, one bring back item mission and one kill target mission.

Now, as usual, i still use these exact slider settings, 1st mission is 95% of times accepted.  However, if i pick a second mission, the same sliders yield another combo of mission choices and the *poof mission gone* risk is there, usually 1 out of 4.

I only roll max one mission as a result of this....but man that lost lvl 200 ncu piece is still imprinted in my mind =/


hope this helps..

It's happened at every mission terminal I've used, but these are my main ones (all of these are single missions). The mission types I select are "Find Item" and "Assassinate". I'm usually looking for missions in Lush Fields, Clon**** or Andromeda.

- Rome Blue: terminal immediately west of highrise 7.
- Rome Blue: terminal at NW gate into Rome Red.
- Omni Ent: terminal at south grid terminal.
- Lush Hills Resort

I always grab 3 missions at one time, but there doesn't seem to be any pattern as to which one of the three attempts will fail.

Aint the 1st time either, too..

Syryx @ 5/13/2002 7:57:12 AM (19215):
hmm i had a similar problem but sort of found out why it happened.

basically, while accesssing my bankvault in ent, the playground crashed. when i logged in again, i found it had "duped" a   medium bag.  this was only visual tho, while had one bag in inv, i could rightclick on the "copy" in bankvault, which would dissapear but not appear in inv. 
I figured it was basically 2 icons leading to the same bag content, an error due to the playground crash.  my workaround was to get one copy of the bag in inv, empty it, delete bag, then rightclick and delete the copy in bank, after making sure i got the right one!
it was the only way i could get rid of the ghost copy in bank.

not sure if you had experienced a playground crash when your bagproblems started but i thought i'd share this with you.
If you did it might be a simple server error..

runey @ 5/13/2002 8:26:06 AM (22954):
Ooo yeah thanks. I was doing one in TLR in one of those mounds and it kept happening. Even sitting down, if I pushed the right arrow (basically sitting in place but turning slightly), boom, back in the mission with 3 orange-reds beating me up again while I was still sitting down.

Here's an idea.  Have the developers run a search on the item database for all items that are marked with the Martial Arts ability.  Then, on the found records, run a script that marks the appropriate field(s) on those records with the necessary values.  Even a semi competent developer or admin should be able to accomplish this in under 30 minutes.  A good one could do it in 5.  Then perform similar search and fix scripts on all the other items that have been reported "borked" since day one.  How about things like the Flower of Life and Horde for example.

Nalissa @ 5/13/2002 9:11:51 AM (24509):
Thank you Cosmik!  

I feel much better knowing that the boys at FC are working on it, and i'm glad to know that at least it's on the table.  

I have noted it happening pretty much everywhere.  Mostly i recieve missions at Tir NW, NE and South terminals.  With alternate characters i have noted it on the south terminals in Omni-trade as well.

So far i have seen it occuring with 'Pick-up', 'return' and 'Machine missions' but i will admit i draw all these missions with the setting 'Full-bad' and 'full-money'.

If it helps, i have occasionally noted that the mission acceptance lags a bit sometimes when i choose.  At the end of this lag I either get the mission or i don't.  Im not sure if the lag is connected to the problem, or if not recieving the mission simply resembles  'acceptance-lag' because it well..  doesn't accept.  =D

Anyway thanx for your response and im sure it will be handelled well .

Nalissa @ 5/13/2002 9:26:19 AM (21512):
All the pet pathing work as an MP made me one hell of a puller as a soldier  

Seems to be a bit easier to pull a mob when you know how to get it through a door and fully into a room (so the door closes behind it) as almost an afterthought due to long practice.

Maybe you should all go make soldiers and enforcers?

Happend a couple times, both humanoid type mobs, not sure if they were the same or not. 
			
		
	
I think that within this post is the key to the problem.  I have noted in on my soldier.  The farther you pull a mob the better the chance it will simply go invisible on destination.  It doesn't have to be invisible to everyone.  My doc was cussed out by an enforcer yesterday who took 3 crits from an invisible mob and died while i stood around having a smoke thinking he was buffing up with mongo or something .  He saw the mob the whole time.

I have also noted that the mob seems to go invisible due to the 'warping effect' the mob does when it can't keep up with pathing and sheer run speed.  

In essence, if you pull a mob and it cant follow you it will warp after you.  If it does this you will still see it, but your party will either 
A:  Not see it 
B:  See it in a different location than you do.  (this is why when you are in the main room fighting your party will run by you into another room and fight there doing damage to it nonetheless)

Here is something that I once had to do that also confirms this theory to an extent:

On one occasion 2 of my party members where fighting (and slowly losing) to an invisible mob.  Armed with my theories on mob-movement i ran around the mission looking in other rooms for a mob that wasn't at full HP.  Sure enough, I found such a mob many many rooms away and was able to jump in and save the day (although they didn't know it at the time) and finish it off with a full-auto.

I am pretty sure it's related to pathing and warping.  The quick fix is to make sure your pullers know they cant pull the thing too far and too fast.  A slow gradual pull will still work over long distance if they can survive it.  

Pet users will also note this with their own pet (I have).  Occasionally your pet will be invisibly fighting a mob even though it is no-where to be seen.  Usually this occurs as you are running through BS missions at Mach 10 with a high-powered team.

Tortueyou i believe has mentioned that his 1.5kish nanoresist rarely if ever counters roots.  You should ask him - but make sure to do it in a 75% or 100% zone

Kinkstaah @ 5/13/2002 12:27:28 PM (24242):
I have the same nano setup as Tort. I resist most nanos.

By most - 75+%

Enough to seriously make a complete mess of any class that depends on nanos.

Natelie @ 5/13/2002 1:12:08 PM (Yalmaha "Hover" Bug. 25105):
Hello.

When you are in a mission, with your Yalmaha in your HUD, then finish the mission and log out INSIDE the mission area, then log on again the next day, you find yourself outside infront of the mission door, in Yalmaha form, right?

Well your Yalmaha is then in a "Hover" mode and cannot fly, it is like a "Kodaik", so u have to re-fit it into ur HUD in order to make it "fly-able". 

If the Hover mode is an intended part of the game, should'nt it be possible to use it with the "backspace" key?

Thanks for ur eye-energy and time. 
=P

Natelie @ 5/13/2002 1:31:11 PM (THE !REASON! for the mission accept bug 25110):
Attnetion. *eherm* =)

My research results:

Whenever u delete a mission, without zoning, the deleted mission remains as a phantom or ghost mission. Since FC has decided to do something about the "after-mission-cleanup" to "speed up the servers", this is what has happened:

The Server's still think deleted missions exist, thus making new "accepted" missions invalid. 

Many poeple accept missions for "save keeping" in-case they find a "better" mission later. and when they do they delete that backup mission, and try searching on the mission terms again, JUSt to find out that they have wasted their money and time. 

So that's the reason:  
After-mission cleanup code interferes with mission deletion. 

Immidiate fix for this bug (attention players!):
Zone after u have deleted a mission, then zone back in.

Natelie @ 5/13/2002 1:57:15 PM (Flower Of Life Bug 25115):
Flower Of Life use to or is intended to be Life-Tap special Attacks.
I have a flower of life which damages for 45 
Heals for 600 HP with a re-use of aprox 4 minutes

But the current Flower of Life are all .. broken. They damage both the player and the NPC for laughable amount of damage with a long re-use. 

Code of flower of life is something like:

25-47
25-47

Meaning 25-47 damage to NPC
                For
              25-47 damage on Player

Makes no sense. 
and it ACTUALLY DOES do that. 

SO i have the last of a Life-tap special attack... Cuz FC obviously nerfed it or.. bugged it accidentally. 

My Flower of Life attack still works tho. 
So here's my question:

Isit bugged or nerfed?   Or...both? lol

Ifit's bugged, please don't consider it to be nerfed because 4 mins re-use, c'mon.... that don't make use traders. =P

When using team health buffs, team member health bars do not register lost health until it dips below what the buff added.

Which makes playing docs rather frustrating as the team list and associated bars is their main tool for directing single heals...

Hextorr @ 5/13/2002 4:14:11 PM (25110):
That might be it... althou when you accept a  mission second time round (after one has poofed already) it will accept, only one mission goes poof, the second one is accepted.

Maybe, one poofed mission, per deleted mission without zoning

I do something similar to that, but i usually stand right in front of the exit door, in case i need to zone to save myself.  I'll try your suggestion.  Thanks for the time you put into drawing that out!

Bionitrous @ 5/13/2002 5:03:39 PM (24242):
Now, Kinkstaah's results seem to be completely in line with how nano resist was supposed to work.  And Tortureyou is at the other end of the spectrum.

As for mentioning Roots, the majority of Fixer Snares and Roots are less than 100% nanoresist as the defense skill.  1500 nano resist gets worked out to 1125 at a 75% rate.  Then again, the Fixer probably has difficulty getting his attack rating up that high.

Wanna see some crap implementation of the 'Crat speeches?  

http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...no=1&id=157527

A level one hundred and eighty six nanoformula that lowers Nanoresist by whole whopping 98 over an area of three feet?  Can you say waste of database space?  500 would have made it worthwhile for something a Crat won't use until the end of his career.

Arinia @ 5/13/2002 6:23:46 PM (24242):

Zarrot @ 5/14/2002 12:42:12 AM (21512):
I can fix the pat pathing issue if you send me the code. Here it is very easy....

1) Open VC++ Project with MOB pathing
2) CTRL-A
3) CTRL-C
4) Open VC++ Project with Pet Pathing 
5) CTRL-A
6) CTRL- V

Boom... now tidy up and it's fixed.  I have never seen a MOB chasing me run into a door jam, get stuck on a chair, or be hindered in any way.  They are right on you.  Outside, MOBs are straight as an arror right to me.  My pet takes run 1/4 mile in the wrong direction then takes a 180 degree long sweeping turn back to the MOB if he just doens't run away after nothing.

(Sorry Cosmik, this is not directed at you I haved worked in software support so I know what it's like to have to deliver the BS statement from the developers to the customers. If it hot, soft, and smelly...it's probably sh*t.) 

These excuses...

"Pet pathing is something we are actively working on. Right now work is being done on the layout of missions to change or remove those items which affect pets (ie chairs etc)."

...are nothing but bull.  It has nothing to do with the structure of the mission rooms...IT HAPPENS OUTSIDE!!!!!!!   (For the record last time I have seen it Mutant Camp by SW Outpost in Lush.)  Every door is an issue they can't find them.  I can be standing outside a door with my bot lined up staring at the MOB in the next room...nothing in the way...I hit attack and boom he takes off not after the mob but out of the room chasing after a butterfly or something.   I've tried walking...helps a little but SLOW.  I've tried lining him up exactly with the door, nope.  Nothing works...but the MOBs are right on you.   IT"S EVERY MISSION.  Not specific ones with specific items...it's all of them.  The code is busted not the mission design.  Should we all start submitting in-game bug reports everytime it happens...this should give you all the details you need but you will certainly be flooded?

There is no way it's this hard to fix if MOBs can path pets should to...it's the same damn logic and decision structure.  Every decision that needs to be made by a MOB when moving are the same decisions a pet needs to make.   It needs to be fixed where the problem lies not covered or bandaided by changing what's in the mission rooms.  Fine remove every table...pets will still get stuck and what then...remove the walls...fine...now it will just run off into space like it does outside...what then...remove the outside and we can all just float around in a vast ether...now they run into the ether, what now...wipe the servers problem solved.

I know I sound a) crazy, b) like a jerk, c) way to sarcastic but it's frustrating to read how the problem is going to be fixed by modifying little pieces to minimize the issue.  My bot can get stuck in the main room....the big one.  How do you tweek that room to fix it?  It's like trying to fix a flat tire on your car with rubber cement....it just ain't gonna work.  Rant Over.....

Nalissa @ 5/14/2002 1:12:28 AM (24509):
That is interesting too and probably related without a doubt.

But it can't be the only factor.  I tend to accept only missions i want and never fail in completing them, so ive usually finished all 3 before i head back to the city i draw the missions in.  

I dont know if i've ever noticed the probelm drawing team missions but i dont believe so.

Nalissa @ 5/14/2002 1:19:02 AM (25105):
This happens any time you equip a yalm in a sitting position and then rise to your feet.  For some reason the powers of flight are not bestowed on you if your yalm-form starts from a sitting position.  Since everyday you log in you are sitting by default i assume this is the case.

Try this:
Start equipping a yalm, and then sit down and wait for the yalm to appear.  then stand up.  Same affect, you are in a yalm that operates like a ground-car.  It can still be fun though

Natelie @ 5/14/2002 2:59:00 AM (25110):
Hm.....

Still related to the after-mission clean-up i'm sure...

At the test servers they made alot of adjustements to the GUI.. like I.P. Menu GUI for IP Re-Alloc. THis caused Lock Picks to be un-buyable since the Terminals were bugged, due to the fact that shopping terms are considered a part of ur GUI. 

I do not know if it has anything to do with the Mission term problem, but i'm sure it a GUI+Server problems. 

(For those who never took IT lessons..a GUI is a "Graphic User Interface")

Kikdabucket @ 5/14/2002 4:08:21 AM (For the love of god, PLEASE fix the HP bar bugs that have been there since day 1!!! 25240):
I can't believe we're still waiting for this.

Bug #1 -  While you're in a team, your team member's HP bars show only their native HP, and the extra HP they have from implants, merit boards and items goes off the scale somewhere and is not visible.

For the low HP/dark blue body dev profs, eg. MPs, NTs, Agents etc. that use a lot of implants and items to try and get their health up, this is deadly in a team.  The doctor/healers don't even know these people are getting hit often until their HP is down to less than half, at which time they're as good as dead once you factor in lag, time to heal etc.

Bug #2 - Buffed HP is shown, but everytime someone goes out of range the HP bar goes down to current HP minus buffed HP, this makes that player look injured, and healers heal them, only to find that as soon as they're selected the HP bar restores back to full, but now they're waiting for heal recharge while someone else is dying.

These 2 bugs caused a lot of anxiety for me, and a lot of shouting from other players to my doc when I was getting to level 100.  I couldn't relax as a doctor, cause I wasn't in control of the situation.  It was one of the 3 reasons, but the main one I put my doc on the shelf to wait for some fixes.  In the meantime I started an MP, and have been levelling up slowly.  I'm now at level 130 on my alt MP!!

Last night, I was one hit away from dying as MP, and when I screamed to the doc for a heal, he said my hp bar was at full.  But in one more hit I would have died and only fleeing saved me.


This is a critical bug that shouldn't have been allowed to go past the first month of production - WHY OH WHY has it been almost a year now, and not a single finger has been lifted to fix it?

PLEASE ... for the the love of god, do something about this!

Engiene @ 5/14/2002 4:21:42 AM (25240):

Well, I have exactly that number in CL (unbuffed) and when I step on the exit to BS a sweet nothing happens.

No Message like "You need at least 250 in CompLit" or whatever this things throw at me when I'm too stupid to use one, nor am I able to exit the grid.

When I use the CL Expertise to up my skill to 270 I step on the exit and "bawoosh" I'm in Home.

Am I missing something here?

You call our hp buffs ok????

Which planet are you on? None of our hp line of buffs are worth the ip points you have to sink into BM to use them. Hp is the only line that uses BM.

Other profs have far better hp buffs so why on earth should we consider putting ip into yet another blue nano skill (atrox soldiers have blue/dark blue nano skills)?

I hope you didnt mean this seriously... titan gives 413 hp....essence alone gives you far more!

With behemoth and team hp + Lifechanneler (and mk II armor), I am close to 8.5k hp. Having gotten those buffs I have used up 1/4 of my ncus for hp buffs only......

Do you honestly think I would waste 500+ skill points in BM to get 413 more?

Too many other things to sink ip into....

The point is, there is no such message at BS.
When I try to use an Elevator to Level 3 I get such a message or when I want to use an exit when ressing and my complit is not high enough.

But not at BS at exactly CL 250. 

Strange but now that I know what is the problem I no longer spend minutes trying to get there but invest some IP next level to get my CL to 251

Bionitrous @ 5/14/2002 3:18:48 PM (25269):
You've probably already done it, and it doesn't address your point exactly ... but general Intelligence Boost will give you 3 points of CompLit.  Likewise a couple of qlvl1 Old English Trading Company pistols will give you +10 Int and 2 or 3 CompLit as well.

But to reiterate the earlier comment, yes, it's 'more than' 250 to drop into Broken Shores not 'at least' which is what the message tells you if you have 249 or less. 

Sounds like a bug to me.

Tom Sawyer @ 5/14/2002 3:56:13 PM (Surgery Clinic Bug 25316):

PS.  I'm concerned that my character may be bugged.  I deactivated my account about 2 months after the initial release and just the other day activated it and began to use the same character again.  FYI

Ebonezer Good @ 5/14/2002 4:30:56 PM (24539):
Cloudeh you worried soldiers might come close to the tanking abilitys of a enforcer?
Lets take a look at the buffs a soldier and enforcer can be expected to cast.

Enforcer:

Essensce of behemoth 1K hps and a useful +27 to str/stam

Failing Impregnability    layers 745 of them

infernal rage                 absorbs 95 points of damage from each hit
                                     and breaks roots + small dot

Coruscating Screen      Absorbs 60 points of damage + 479 Hps
                                     little bit of ac

Mongo crush                adds around 2k max hps and a very nice
                                    HoT


Soldiers

reactive reflective          30% reflect

Heavy Assault shield     530ac

titans physique             400hps

precognition                 55 to evades Woot !

so enforcers can add around 3500 hps shield 155 points of damage from every hit and have a layer that refreshs itself for 745........

Soldiers can add 400 hps and 55 to evades the reflect shield has the net effect of adding 30% to his hps


say a level 150 enforcer and soldier has 5k hps using above nanos
the enforcer will have 8500 + sheild line + HOT + breaking roots/canceling hostiles + 745 of layers

The soldier will have 7020 hps (taking into account shield) + 530 to ac +55 to evades.

I havent started this as a flame Cloudeh, I have a lot of respect for you really I do =)

Its just that out and out soldiers have weaker nanos lines, also our nano lines dont scale properly.
Enforcers really do have it all, also your offensive/OE nanos are superior to the soldier equivelent.
beam/hammer weilders already outdamage soldiers. seen an Enforcer kill a similar level soldier through his mirror and enforcer was still at 80%

IMO soldiers should be an equal tank to enforcers, they currently aint.

DONT say "but you got mirror", as you well know mirror is not going to save the doc most likely it will get the doc killed. For those who dont know, there is no way for a soldier to taunt with mirror up.
Also in PvP mirror aint all its cracked up to be either, we are any rooting classes ***** after all

disclaimer : enforcers are a balanced (ok rage is broke but thats fixed soon) I AM IN NO WAY SAYING THEY SHOULD BE NERFED, just soldiers need a fix or ten. Don't try and shoot down our requests for our nano lines to be fixed please.

EDIT 
sorry I forgot about Soldiers worthless healing nano 200-300 damage healed 1.3 attack and 2.7 recharge. ok at low levels but yet again its another nano that doesnt scale correctly (in this case not at all)
Also I think enforcers get more hps per level as well, not saying soldiers should get as much but just saying.

Ebonezer Good @ 5/14/2002 5:02:16 PM (24539):
putting it another way.
Also as stated previous enforcers can raise shield ac to 155 using best buffs.
Soldiers can absorb 30% of damage.

Say your tanking a mob that hits for 400 damage average. 

Soldiers reflect will bring that down to 307 damage.

Enforcers shield ac will bring it down to 245 damage.

The reflect shield only starts to absorb more damage than enforcers shields at over 600 average damage.

EDIT maybee I was wrong Maybee Im right, see post further down

"Right now work is being done on the layout of missions to change or remove those items which affect pets (ie chairs etc)."
---- Cosmik


Thats like fixing a flat tire, by flating the other 3, or 1 if your on a motorcycle, or 2 if your on a 3 wheeled cycle.


Fix pathing, dont remove items, soon misison will be one big box, at least now there a box with some chairs and couches.


Also Corners are the main issue! are  you gonna turn the box into a circle? I dunno about you guys!

Mr.Nothing @ 5/14/2002 6:16:56 PM (Enable a way to disable auto targeting 25337):
I play as a crat, and having my view tossed every 2 seconds, makes it very hard for me to target mobs ide like to mez or charm.

i understand if i play in 3rd person there wont be a problem, but 3rd person in missions suck, the view is all bugged and the camera jumps all over the place!


Please let me know of a way to disable auto attacking, i dont want it! it isnt hard to hit the q button is it? so i dont need this auto targeting, i understand it is great for mele classes but please! dont make it manditory, allow Crats and others to take it off, you dont know how many times ive been low on heal, mezed something, but look it hit me right before i mezzed, and now i just attacked it, breaking the damn mez!


And no i am not taking my gun off! 

I figure that would be funcoms first tip!

Zensunni @ 5/14/2002 6:46:31 PM (21512):
I agree that *fixing* troublesome rooms by removing furniture is not the way to solve this problem of pet-pathing.

 It's nothing but a band-aid solution and a weak attempt at trying to throw the dog a bone while you eat the steak.

Satisfies for a while but the dog still ends up hungry.

Pathing works for MOB's....there is no reason why it shouldn't work for our pets too.

And besides all this....you've still done nothing to acknowledge that the problem also exists outdoors. Yes....OUTDOORS.


Another bump to keep this issue alive.

Your best HP buff being half as good as ours is very reasonable.  Perhaps the cost is a bit high, but perhaps FC never intended you to use HP buffs at all until very high levels.  I don't know about that part.  I DO know that the amount of HP they buff should not increase at all, no matter what.  For the amount they buff, compared to ours, it's reasonable.  The skill requirements may need a look.  But I don't think you should be able to self cast the highest one until we can self cast behemoth (getting up near 160).


	
		
			
			
				I hope you didnt mean this seriously... titan gives 413 hp....essence alone gives you far more!
			
		
	
Behemoth essence is 996.  About twice as much.

Enforcers' best reflect shield is about half as good as...  er... wait, we don't have a reflect shield.  That's right! 


	
		
			
			
				With behemoth and team hp + Lifechanneler (and mk II armor), I am close to 8.5k hp. Having gotten those buffs I have used up 1/4 of my ncus for hp buffs only......
			
		
	
With no MKII armor, 250 token board, and 175ish life implants, I self buff to 7100 HP with mongo.

7100 + 1800 x 3 (mongos HoT over 60 seconds) = 12500 HP over the course of 60 seconds.

You have TMS which is, with only 5k base HP, is 20,000 effective HP over the course of about 60 seconds.  Not to mention that your shield hits the attacker back for damage.


My point is not to say Soldiers don't need attention.  They do.  I just think that you are looking in the wrong direction.  You're looking for something to make your class more interesting/fun to play.  Enforcers are just as boring as soldiers to play, we just have the aggro management to keep us busy.

You need something that doesn't infringe on other classes' class-defining abilities.  HP is all we have.  We survive by having more HP for the enemy to eat through.  You survive by not taking the damage in the first place.  That's the way they designed us.  Extrapolate from that, don't ask for other classes' abilities.

PS: I also highly doubt that Soldiers HP buffs stack with doc HPs and essence.  Unless they are the same line as the HPs from enforcers shields?  I can't test as I don't know a soldier with HP buffs.

PPS: Enforcers "shield AC" doesn't work the way "Ebonezer Good" describes it.  Or at least I don't think it does.  If it does, it's the best-kept secret in the AO enforcer realm

Ebonezer Good @ 5/14/2002 8:02:40 PM (24539):
it does I assure you.
Only point is I don't think it will bring a mobs hits to under min damage, not an issue on real means/ace/vets as they will never be hitting for min damage.

I will try and test this to see if it does bring hits below min 
damage.

Now then where did I put that bracer of shielding hrm...

Arinia @ 5/14/2002 8:37:30 PM (24539):
My bad, I read it wrong.

"modify  target  shield melee damage 60  " means 60 less melee damage on every hit, you are correct (as far as I can tell, that is  )

Meligant @ 5/14/2002 8:59:00 PM (24539):
FYI - 

Soldier HP buff line and the Enforcer line DO NOT STACK.

however, the soldier line does stack with the DOC Long term HP buff line but not the short (2 min) line.

Hope that helps.

I am an engineer using the following weapons and buffs:

MTI B-94  damage 4-58(30).
 Energy Spike +8 energy damage
Sympathetic Arms Enhancement  +14 all damage types

Now, usually I hit for minimum damage.  I'm an engineer, I understand.  But I usually hit for  20  points a hit.  Minimum above is 4 + 8 + 14 = 26 points.  What's going on?

DJKI @ 5/14/2002 9:26:15 PM (25240):
I viewd this post because I thought it was relating to another bug/glitch I've noticed.  It pissed the hell out of me too.  OK, so here it is.  I go outside of the mission to let my HP regenerate and to use healthpacks, then I minized the game and go get something to drink.  I com back and bring thr game back up, and I noticed my HP was ALL the way FULL, in every area where HP is indicated.  I thought to myself "That was a little quick!", but didn't take too much thought into it, and ran back into the mission.  To my GREAT luck I fight an NPC and as I am fighting my HP seems full, and then all of a sudden my HP drops all THE WAY to "0"!!!!  My mouth dropped, and then i realized it must have been a Graphical glitch, missreporting my HP, FUNCOM!!!! ARRRG, I usually don't get mad at you guys, BUT now..... oh well, didn't loose too much Exp.

DJKI @ 5/14/2002 9:31:33 PM (25110):
Ya, I've been having the same problems.  Natelie, your explanation seems very reasonable, and I believe it could be the answer to our troubles, BUT I noticed that when I try to accept on mission, it will dissapear as ususal, but I get angered and try to get another, AND for some reason it accepts it and it shows up.

For these reasons I believe it may be a lag issue on funcoms servers......someone correct me if I am wrong.

Beartwo @ 5/14/2002 10:08:16 PM (24539):
very little at all...and for me BM is a dark blue skill that is not used for anything else.

So I`ll leave well anough alone....BM is a useless skill except for hp buffs...and since other professions do it so much better.

I am not asking for a better hp buff...I dont need it.

What I do need is something to up my atk rating (infuse Assault and Ranged energy), Heavy weapon buffs....

As it is now...we arent masters of anything except our shield.

I want that to change!

Traders should not outdamage us with ranged weaponry! and getting a high atk rating should be easy for us...!!!

Ataman @ 5/14/2002 10:19:55 PM (24539):
Yes indeed this bugs SHOULD be corrected. Thank you Meligant for bringing attention for this.
And Arinia may just STFU. Becouse of ppl like you professions get more nerfs instead of improves. Now go to agent forum and start whinning becouse agent can kill you with his aimed shot in one hit past 14.2 lol

Oberan @ 5/14/2002 10:48:19 PM (25364):
check some things

1. do you have a fixer run buff 
2. Are you hitting a mob with a reflect or absorb shield (reflect shields can reduce blow min damage and absorb shields can absorb a hit completely until you break through the amount it can absorb)

Vdpmeat @ 5/14/2002 10:53:23 PM (25364):
Looks like the B-94 does projectile damage even though it uses energy weapon ammo.


Clip  20 - energy  
Damage  4-58 (30) - projectile ac

Energy Spike wont add to it.

Sredni @ 5/14/2002 11:13:33 PM (24539):
Now now, to be fair Arinia is only trying to protect her proffs turf. Unfortunately for soldiers every time we ask for luvin all the other proffs jump in to protect their turf and the end result for us is more nerfs instead of luvin.

 oh and as for the enforcer damage shields, I'm pretty sure they don't lessen the damage you take at all. I think .

 As for enforcer's being "the" tanks in ao. That's no good, enforcer's shouldn't be superior as tanks to soldiers, or MA's. All three proffs should be a viable choice when a team needs a tank, and it just ain't so atm. You will never, ever, see a team saying "team of 5 looking for a tank, enforcer, soldier, or ma.", the enforcer is always 100% 1st choice as a team's tank.

 Really, we don't want our hp buffs to be as good as enforcer hp buffs. But as they are now, they are NOT worth the ip needed to cast them. And to top it off they're bugged with the top 2 hp buffs being inferior to the 3rd best. And even if they did make our hp buffs equal, we still wouldn't have mongo. Hell, the enforcer damage shield gives more hp's then the soldier hp buff line.

jakesnake5 @ 5/15/2002 12:02:30 AM (4871):
My trader is currently geared to use one type of weapon, the blackened blaster (rifle or not). Most times I cant FIND one of the appropriate level I want to shift to, and would LOVE to be able to build my own. but the blaster and blaster rifle kits are fubar'd.

I think the programmers have forgotten this problem, in trying to tweak the Agents. Somebody smack them with an Endless Beam.

[QUOTE]Originally posted by Ebonezer Good 
[B]Cloudeh you worried soldiers might come close to the tanking abilitys of a enforcer?
Lets take a look at the buffs a soldier and enforcer can be expected to cast.

Enforcer:

Essensce of behemoth 1K hps and a useful +27 to str/stam

YUP, We are the HP buffing Class Fewl .


Failing Impregnability    layers 745 of them

Once, when its used take out of NCU memory.

infernal rage                 absorbs 95 points of damage from each hit
                                     and breaks roots + small dot

Nope, thats a lie, its 95 DMG! No absorb.

Coruscating Screen      Absorbs 60 points of damage + 479 Hps
                                     little bit of ac

Lie again, Reflect 60 point of Dmg not absorb

Mongo crush                adds around 2k max hps and a very nice
                                    HoT

Have you done it during pvp, its bugged to ****ery, If you have 2k hp, that means people can crit you for 800 more, which hasnt been filled up, oh you are the newb. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soldiers

reactive reflective          30% reflect
Nice

Heavy Assault shield     530ac

Not much good

titans physique             400hps

So? your not an enforcer! give us reflect if you get that!

precognition                 55 to evades Woot !
Better than nothing.

Cloudeh @ 5/15/2002 12:49:30 AM (24539):
Id lust like to say enforcer and Soldiers should be equal, but no class is the same, you have the uber and crap proffession.

Soldier and Enfocer SHOULD have ruled the playing field.
MA should be between both classes so u there aswell.

Sucks dont it?

Soldier shold have been the Weapons expert.
Enforcer should have been the melee alternative.


To be honest, if you change the Soldier that will make any difference at all, make sure you keep enforcer up there.

One thing, Everytime I make a new character, no matter what, same with my brother, I always end up being a tank, as a metter of fact My Soldier blizzaga usually tanks for a team nowadays.

Ebonezer Good @ 5/15/2002 1:02:00 AM (24539):
yes it does reflect 60 points of damage, which incidentley means you dont take 60 points of damage. does it not? test it ? low damage hits on it wont reflect the full 60 points, as stated Im pretty certain it wont bring a hit below the mininum damage for that mob/player. I'll go test it when I'm done posting this and write back for sure. May take a while.

for the record, I don't care how they do it, I just want my soldier to be the tank/damage dealer he deserves to be =)
I don't think you need worry about a soldier having anywhere near the same HPs as your good selfs Enforcers.
But please dont shoot down our attempts to get improvements.

You wouldnt like it if I started a thread about you NOT getting rage fixed would you?

*dons flame retardent suit*

P.S. Cloud what gives you the right to call me a fool and a liar ?

EDIT yes I had heard of the mongo bug, I'm not sure of the specifics as I don't play a PvP Enforcer. Hardly makes me a newb does it =P
You can cast mongo and then wait for it to fill up recast and off you go. I belive Enfs try to have mongo running at all time during PvP. aye?

Cloudeh @ 5/15/2002 1:09:56 AM (24539):
No yes Yes, im sorry about that and Yup I do keep it running.


I dont see it reflecting dmg off me, just a "damage" shield.

speardancer2 @ 5/15/2002 2:24:34 AM (25316):
Make sure to target yourself before you click on the free standing clinics.

this is apparently the way Funcom wants it to work, and it's not much of a bother, but would be nice it is was listed somewhere.

Ebonezer Good @ 5/15/2002 5:44:35 AM (24539):
Just realised how far off topic this thread has got DOH.
Anyways, I grabbed an agent friend and let him shoot me up for a while, he was running FP enforcer.
Agent was weilding a stigma. He crits for 1.3k or so on leets

His attack rating remain constant throughout, he was unbuffed.

I was unbuffed other than an essence. Had 4k HPs. I kept my agg/def bar at just under 50% throughout.

Let him shoot me a few times and he scored crits of 528.

I then had him cast babaric blades on me (+25 shield ac)
http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=55747

crits were reduced to 520....
Which makes no sense to me.

neither of us fancied staying in the arena long enough to do a few hundred non-crit shots, maybee someone with more time on there hands can?

For a bit of fun I asked random people what they thought Enfs generally said no or very little damage absorbed.
advents generally said yes.
and the lone engineer said he didn't care.
*shrug*
so I petitioned, had some young ark tell me he had no idea but would ask for me.
Still had no further answer from him by the time I logged.

No real conclusion to be drawn from this =/

/me opens a tun of choc chip and COOKIE dough ice cream !

Cozmic, if your out there, Maybee you could ask the devs What shield AC  is supposed to do ? and then ask them what it actually does.

ON TOPIC !
Soldiers need some luvin =) The soldier community is at last getting more vocal about its problems. Please don't try and stop us from seeking improvments to our class.

Kikdabucket @ 5/15/2002 6:33:36 AM (25269):
I think they're using some kind of logic like (sorry for the perl format) -


	Code:
	if ($Computer_Literacy < 250) {
    print "You must have greater than 250 Computer Literacy to use this exit!"
} elsif ($Computer_Literacy > 250) {
    &zone;
}
Looks okay at first glance, but will of course is going to give you a message at lower, let you zone if higher, but do squat if you're on the exact number.... just a bit of flawed logic, and yes I agree should be fixed.

I've tested this myself after encountering the issue a long time ago.  It happens on all the exits and elevators I tested on ... message below the number, nothing on exact number, and lets you zone above the number.

Hell, I'll take that. It's better than having my pet jammed in a corner.

Loretta @ 5/15/2002 3:16:46 PM (Master Virus Builders - Full Heals 25477):
I've encountered similar pattern over the past 2 days.  Master Virusbuilders in missions heal FULLY.

The first mission had a room with 2 MVBs.  It was evident that one was healing the other.  It wasn't a gradual heal, but rather a full HP restore (from 25-33 to 100% health).  I shrugged and moved on.

I've encountered the same problem last night while in SFH.  This time it was a single mob.  After 3 iterations of this I cast a nano shutdown which solved the problem.  

Is this intentional?

Bionitrous @ 5/15/2002 3:59:37 PM (25477):
They been doing full heals a while now.  You'll catch an Adventurer that does that too.  NanoShutdown takes care of the problem.

Real issue is that the damn MOB's have too much nanopool to let this appear realistic.  You could spend a half hour or more fighting one of these things and they eventually run out of nano.

FunCom needs to have them have a very high nano pool or else they'll run out of nano as they buff each other waiting for you to get to them in the mission.  

But, they really need to be dropped down to a normal level once you start fighting them.

Likewise they need to follow the same rules as players.  That Adventurer full heal takes 10 seconds to cast.  Now while the MOB is casting it, he's shooting at me AND it only takes him two seconds to get off.

I don't mind the appropriate MOB's fully healing themselves.  It's just that they need to suffer the penalties of not attacking while the nano is charging and the extreme nano cost penalty of using that nano.

Moriamis @ 5/15/2002 4:36:26 PM (24242):
So you are saying Nano Resist does actually work? I trained my up as an NT as its a green skill and have wrist implants to boost it and I still get the situation where a light green mob always gets me with a nano formula and then counters mine. Everyone I ask in the game says it simply does not work. At what level does it have any noticeable effect?

Thank you to whoever spent all the IP raising it really high to find me the answer

Ebonezer Good @ 5/15/2002 4:42:10 PM (ADD all off 25501):
As far as I can tell this stat is supposed  to add too attack ratin directly.
If a soldier casts auto targeting (all all off 23)
his attack rating increases by 23

So why then does my token board (and others I checked)
have no effect on my attack rating?
Is "add all off" supposed to have a mystery effect not related to attack rating or is it the token board that is bugged?

Arinia @ 5/15/2002 5:01:05 PM (25501):
Token board affects my attack rating.  I was wondering why my attack went from 899 to 900, I have been capped for 20 levels+.  Then I realized I just got my 250 board.

skybert @ 5/15/2002 5:20:59 PM (Invicible teammembers in missions. 25511):
This is an old problem, but I cannot remember seeing any posts about it here (too lazy to search further than the first page as well).

Sometimes, in missions, teammembers become invicible. I can not see them, but they see me. Or the other way around.  Kinda annoying when you ask them where they are, and they tell you "right in front of you, man" and they think I am a fool because of it.

One trick that fixes the problem (until next time it occurs), is for the invicible player to move out of visual range of the rest, and go back again. That usually helps.

Oh, while we're talking about invicibility: Sometimes, mobs are invicible in the same way too.  Thank god for autoattack (which works 50% of the time when dealing with invis. mobs)

Bionitrous @ 5/15/2002 6:34:50 PM (24242):
Problem is the damn 'to-hit' formula.  I think it leaves too much chance for someone with a low ATK to still hit someone with a high DEF.

Someone needs to work out the formula exactly.  Take yer level 6 Agent and have him shoot a rifle with his Rifle Skill of under 100 at an MA with Dodge at 1000.  I bet he still hits him couple times.  Even that rollerratt outside Newland still hits me and it's been grey for a year now.

I would not and won't say nano resist is 'broke' until someone throws up some numbers.  What I *will* say is that nano resist is 'wrong'.  

If that Agent has to try 10 times to get a root to stick, then it's stuck for the full duration of the nano.  NanoResist won't affect the damage done by Nukes if and when they land.  I don't even think you use us Nano if your target counters a nano.

They need to have at a minimum a 'duration check' done for specific harmful Nanos (Roots, Snares, NanoShutdown, Ransack, Dominate, InitDebuffs, etc.) done when they land.  It's the quickest way of 'fixing' nano resist.  

Very easy formula for these specific nanos: 

Duration = (Listed Duration - (ATK/Def)*0.75*Listed Duration).

If your NanoResist is waaay higher than the nano skills needed to execute the formula then you reduce the duration by 3/4.  If you have NO NanoResist, then the nano lasts as long as it says in the description.

Sure, that level 10 Agent may Root you, but it will last a half second at most if you are Raging.

Coldstrike @ 5/15/2002 6:38:46 PM (24539):
Just because our hp buffs are about half of the enforcers hp buffs it doesn't mean that they are bad. Titan Physique is still +400 odd hp, and +400 is better than nothing when you don't have an enforcer around.

I wouldn't mind if the top two hp buffs were increased a little, but not to the extent that they become better than EoB. As a soldier I know how it feels when other professions become better than you at your own class defining feature, so making soldier buffs better than enforcers will just stir up more anger.

It would be nice if the soldier hp buffs had some sort of fancy side effect tho. Nothing major or anything, but just something to add a little flavour. Essence has size and str/stam modifiers, doc buffs has a slow HoT on them etc. Just a visual effect other than the two white circles crossed over my chest would go a long way.

Bionitrous @ 5/15/2002 6:39:48 PM (25511):
If any of your team members can see the invisible MOB, the don't hesitate to /assist them to get a lock on the MOB.  Sometimes works sometimes doesn't.  You should always get a target at least an possibly send a pet or try to /follow to where your client thinks the monster is.

I wish I had a 'resync' hot-key.

Wahoo. @ 5/15/2002 6:43:02 PM (24242):
My favorite ..

Is when you try to debuff yourself and resist..
That is funny.

Coldstrike @ 5/15/2002 6:44:40 PM (24242):
I don't know if this is 100% accurate, but I have heard reports that roots and possibly other hostile nanos break faster if you have high nano resist. Seems like another attack check is made every n seconds, and as soon as it fails the root breaks.

Bionitrous @ 5/15/2002 6:59:15 PM (24539):
Yer higher level HP buff is broken because FunCom thought the regen boost would actually matter.  Notice that the higher level nano has a Heal Delta of 3 and the lower has a Heal Delta of only 2?  Somewhere along the line FunCom dropped almost all percentages in the game to improve server performance and instead of healing 3% faster you get a whopping 3 more health every time you auto-regen health.

The difference between your HP buffs and the Enforcer's is that the Soldiers were supposed to represent a 'superhuman' type of effect.  You were supposed to be healing your wounds faster than regular people.  The slightly lower hitpoint gain would be offset by an increased natural healing ability netting in an overall more effective nanoformula.

The nanoformula database if FULL of garbage like this.  Here's another:

http://antiguardians.org/itemdb.php?...ano=1&id=30095

level 90 nanoformula taking up 28(!!!) NCU that adds a stinking 12 nano everytime you naturally regen nano.  It might actually take more nano to cast it than it regenerates over 45 minutes.

It's an area of lost opportunity for the nanoformula designers.  Unlike a Humidity Extractor which has an active component ("you got nano from ....") or an HoT ("You were healed by ..."), both the Health and Nano regen boosters work on the normal passive regen 'tick' which has two distinguishing characteristics.

Firstly, it's slower than either the HE or HoT ticks.  Nice tradeoff to be gained there.  Secondly, each regens more if you are 'resting' (sitting down).

I'd like to see FunCom look at all items and Nanos that affect HealDelta and NanoDelta and reevaluate them for both NCU cost and effect while active and sitting.

A Soldier who is under the effect of 'an improved' 'Soothing Calm' (the Crat nano listed above) might not get a ton of Nano while fighting (but still a little), but when he sits down to wait out recharge on his MK shield he might notice a true movement in his Nanopool bar.  Likewise his health bar would actually be seen moving if he has his own HP buff going.  Both might be minor benefits, but still add to a teams efficiency in terms of Nanokits used by the Docs and the Soldier himself.

Change the HealDelta in the higher level Soldier formula listed above to '50' instead of '3' and it might be a start.

Bionitrous @ 5/15/2002 7:02:18 PM (24242):
FunCom Dev's have stated several times on these boards that IF a nano lands, it's for full duration.  Not saying it's Gospel.  Just when a Dev says it, it's all we have to go on until we do our own testing.

High level Roots can last for several minutes.

Get your guild together with 10 Nanoresist, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000.

Land a 10 minute root on all of them at the same time and see how long they last.  10 minutes work and you got your answer.

Hextorr @ 5/15/2002 8:24:10 PM (25110):
i been testing it further and it seems to happen for no reason:
Sometimes i delete a mission then try to get a new one emidiatly after and i have no problems, other times i go to get the first mission and it eats it, it just seems random!

Aristaeus @ 5/16/2002 3:06:12 AM (25316):
There also seems this tiny feature of having not the right clinic selected (could be that the problem was what spear suggestd though). Seems that below lvl6 you can only use the starter clinic and above only the ones outside the starter area

speardancer2 @ 5/16/2002 4:12:15 AM (25269):
someone definetely needs to look at their math at Funcom

This is a newbie programming error, I should know, that's about the level of programing I know, and they taught me that one of those needs a >= instead of just a >

Reloading has the same problem... if you are short just 1 charge/bullet/shell,  it usualy won't reload....

Won't tell you it's full, won't do the reload, just sits there and looks at you funny.

Askeladden @ 5/16/2002 9:46:20 AM (Team health bar 25624):
Im having problems with my team health bar, its not updating when team members take dmg. This ofcause is a major problem for me, i play a healer and are to heal my team members. 

Since the bar dont show the correct HP on team members I cant heal as good as i would have liked to. Now i have to do /assist on the mob we are fighting to see who is getting hit.

FC, please take a look at this issue, is a major problem for many players.

And another problem regarding team health bar. When team members are out of view of each other, and the team window goes "black". Like target not around. When the team members get back into view the team health bar shows half their HP, i have to click on the person for the health bar to show the correct HP.

BrontoCowboy @ 5/16/2002 10:59:05 AM (25110):
Actually, that was a good guess Natelie, but I don't think that's it.  Here's my scenario from 1 week ago:

1.  Got 3 missions, completed them all.
2.  Returned to Avalon to get missions.
3.  Picked through missions, only accepting those that I meant to keep (in other words, I don't do the "backup" think).
4.  Accepted 1 mission, accepted a 2nd, then a 3rd.
5.  Left to complete missions.

However, the bug affect me 5 times during picking those 3 missions...  There were 5 missions I tried to accept at various points, and the server wouldn't let me accept them. :/  Oh well... It's weird, because sometimes it's really bad (had 12 total occurrences that night!!! :/ ) but tonight it didn't happen once for example.

I'll keep you updated on this one.
			
		
	
The higher level HP buff has a healdelta of 3 and the lower has a healdelta of only 2. Looks like soldiers were to be supposed to heal themself faster (as mentioned by Bionitrous in the post before), but in gameplay these healdelta of 2/3 don't change much.

The HP nano line needs something unique the make people want it, why not add an first aid boost? First Aid is the only way a soldier can heal himself during a long hard fight (forget OneMoreHitHealing). Something that reduces the time between first aid usages and boost the first aid skill would help a lot.

Tom Sawyer @ 5/16/2002 3:29:54 PM (25316):
Thanks for the replies, but no dice.  I've even reinstalled the game, started a new character from scratch, and it's still not working.  The process I go through is this:

Make sure I have adequate stats for the implant

Select self and right click on the surgery clinic.

Surgery clinic works, does the graphic burst, says "enabled" and tells me I have 5 minutes to swap implants.

I open my inventory, pick up the implant and drag it over to the implant window.

Here I right click, left click, left click + shift, right click + shift, stand on one foot and bark, nothing works.  It gives me the message "you need technical supervision" and says I cannot wear that implant even though I KNOW I have the stats AND the treatment skill required even without the 100 point boost.

And it still is not bumping my treatment skill.  I can't figure it out.

I have played AO since release and I have never found a working Flower of Life. I just spoke to a GM today and he did not even know what I was talking about. Since MAs have only a few viable attacks I was wondering if you could tell me where you got your working FoL from? The store or in a mission chest? I have rolled nearly 30 missions with FoL as item reward and ZERO have been working versions. Funcom will NEVER fix this so if there is some way of generating one, then by all means, please share!

Greenhawk @ 5/16/2002 8:51:53 PM (25115):
off a dead MA mob.  It is QL 60, and functions perfectly.  I have also heard of QL200 ones that work perfectly.  However, since that one, I have found hundreds (or at least dozens) of broken ones of varying QLs.

Since then, I have heard of others with QL 60 ones that seem to work.  They hit for 40, and heal for 600.  It is my assertion that it is ONLY QL60s (and 200s) that have working models... all others are broke-a$$.

My experience for what it is worth...

Same thing here. I would either be coming back from completed missions to get more and this would strike, or I would be freshly logged in and freshly zoned and this would strike. I never delete missions, I either complete them or let them expire (because I'm going to bed or something).

Death of a thousand bugs...

Evilspork @ 5/17/2002 12:35:45 PM (25040):
I've had the same issue also. Cursor lags everywhere, but really bad in really laggy areas (BS, Tir, Avalon, etc). I believe it's a graphics problem, because why would your internet connection have anything to do with where your cursor is on the screen? 

Athlon 700, 512MB RAM, 32MB GeForce 2 GTS, Winodws XP. I upgraded to a GeForce 4400 a couple weeks ago, and while I haven't played AO much on it, I still noticed the same amount of cursor lag. I also don't notice any difference between windowed and fullscreen modes.

Evilspork @ 5/17/2002 12:37:28 PM (25240):
Both of these bugs have happened to me (although I'm not a healer, it's still annoying ), in addition to another funky display bug that happens after rezzing. As your body dev and nano pool regenerate from the rez shock, your total amount of hit points and nano points isn't updated. Zoning will update the two bars, as will opening your skill window and clicking the 'Accept' button without allocating any ip. Using the 'Accept' method will give you a message saying "You were healed for X points", where X is the difference between your initial amount of (bugged) hitpoints and the true amount of hitpoints you have. What this bug can cause if you're not aware of it is that your health bar might not be all the way full and you try to heal, you see the 'poof' of it working, but get no message saying you were healed and the bar does not change. Bye bye spendy first aid stim/treatment kit.

God, the wacky ass bugs we deal with in this game...

Evilspork @ 5/17/2002 12:40:57 PM (24825):
The funniest part is that while FUncom won't do anything to help legit players with these bugs, all those exploiters get off Scot free, maybe banned a bit, but with all their ill gotten goods/xp intact.

Evilspork @ 5/17/2002 12:43:52 PM (25364):
Yes, you want to get a buff/ring that matches the damage type of your weapon. If you don't, the mob will just absorb the small amount of damage done by the black sheep buff. It already absorbs a certain amount of the main damage, and a matching damage buff is just gravy after that.

No details, as usual. 

Can't we get just one or two straight answers a month? We want to hear "OK, we know the problem is A, B, and C, so we're doing X, Y, and Z to fix it. This will be available in 14.X, which we hope will be out in two months", not "Yeah, I read it and sent the devs a message about it, but I'm not sure if they're even alive in there... they haven't said anything to me in a couple weeks". Fill your statements with qualifications and 'maybes', we understand that things change in development, stuff happens, features get delayed. JUST TALK TO US!!!

Gotta agree that the only real benefit to being a 'trox is getting a Beam and having 'da Taunter.  It's a nice image, but as we all know, 'beauty is only skin deep'.

Finally at the point where my 'trox MP does every nano in the game.  This is where the Nano MP and Atrox MP should really start diverging.   I would expect DOUBLE the hitpoints of them scrawny runts in exchange for having to go so damn long with inferior nano skills and nanopool.

RandaZ @ 5/17/2002 4:34:05 PM (Evil Bank Gnomes Strike Again 25753):
RANT FOLLOWS

I'm not sure if it's the latest patch or what, but the bank gnomes have struck again.  I went down to my local bank terminal to pick up an order for a customer and lo and behold, the entire contents were rearranged.

To most, this normally wouldn't be so bad.  But by this time, my tailor shop was doing well enough that I had about 500 pieces of armor in stock scattered through bags in the bank.  They were nicely organized with marker items denoting what was in the bags.  A workable system.  Assuming that the bank gnomes were erradicated (as they were a while ago).  

Now those gnomes are back and *sigh*, I don't have the time nor the inclination to reinventory.  Other bank bugs also remain, such as the fact that certain medium bags cannot be placed into the bank without rezoning (I'm at a loss as to why this could be).  The 'feature' as it were, that we cannot see what's in our bags unless we take them out (to counter duping I know) also exists.  All of these bugs combined, has made the life of a shop keeper a living hell.  I'm tired and don't want to deal with it anymore.  As such, I'm closing up shop permanently.  

This rant if you will is just to log my experience with the bugs (cirrca v14.10).  Hence it's on this forum.    It was fun while it lasted.

Contrary to my previous statement about quitting, I thought - hey, while I've still got some time left on my so-far un-refunded subscription, I might as well carry on.

And guess what? Yep, its happened again, only this time between mine and my partner's alternative characters.

We lost 135000 credits after a transfer and almost immediate mutual crash. This time we were graced by a visit from a GM (Wojan1). He gave us the usual spiel about how sorry he was, how there was nothing he could do, but please write to FC so that they could consider our request for a refund.

I pointed out that I hadn't received a reply to my first email. Ah, he says, mention my name in the next email saying that I believe you deserve a reply.

Well I did that and sorry Mr Wojan1 but they haven't replied to that one either. I tried a petition last night asking what my next step should be, considering FC were ignoring my emails. I waited for about 3 hours until I was next in the queue, and then next time I typed /petition status I got the message "you have no petitions in the queue", so the b******s decided to ignore that too!

I am now at the stage where the only way to keep my sanity is to occasionally have a little hysterical laugh to myself. 

Has anybody got any idea how I can get some sort of response from FC about this? Please?

Sweet!  I wish i had this problem more often.

My advice?  Keep fighting him indefinately.  When you finally kill him you'll get a pile of xp, since xp is based on damage done to each mob.

I once got 1/2 million of a Vet OT Doctor.

Nalissa @ 5/18/2002 3:33:15 AM (25240):
Very wacky.

I was thinking of writing out just one hour of playing, and detailing every bug encountered/worked around.  Must number in the hundreds.

When you start really paying attention, it's awe-inspiring how many bugs are all around you and you never really payed attention before.  We've been trained to run our fingers over the F keys as docs, and that is part of what makes a 'good healer'.  Many days it doesn't even occur to us to ask why we have to do that in the first place.  I really don't see the problem - I've never been playing starcraft and had trouble with the health-bar.  

This is bar-none and by-far the buggiest game i've ever seen or even conceived of seeing as a full-release.  I love it just the same, but it needs some serious attention.

Btw, you forgot to mention the health-bar bug where someone takes damage, and they are healed, but the hp-bar is stuck at their 'damaged' state.  You can waste 13 heals on a person (usually team heals since someone else is taking damage) but their HP bar WILL not move.  The only way for their hp bar to move is for the status of their health to change - meaning they have to take damage.  You can only hope that it isn't a comparable amount of damage to place the hp bar at the spot where it was immobile before, or you wont even SEE the difference.  Once again this can be fatal to the weaker classes.

Once again in plain view i will reiterate the primary rule to bug fixes.  If the bug helps people advance faster - it will be fixed.  Secondary on the list are bugs that slow down advancement.  I don't see the business-sense in this (barring the serious exploits - which are emergencies IMO) but there you have it.  

We play a game where any one of 100's of bugs might get us killed in a mission and most times it feels more like we are fighting the game than fighting the mobs.  Perhaps that is the cause of the childest angst we see alot of on these boards?    Most people feel like they are at war with Funcom to level, not at war with Mobs.

"I could have handled the mob if he hadn't gone invisible and started shooting me from nowhere.  The doc didn't even see the damage, and by the time i was able to tell him, some bump on the floor put him out of my Line Of Sight and he couldn't heal me.  I tried to zone, but i still took 10 hits after I zoned."

--sounds like a very rare occurance to me - i only hear this kind of thing once every hour of play MAX

Oberan @ 5/18/2002 3:54:18 AM (25477):
they fixed the exp buildup from damage in about 13.6 i beleive

you no longer get more exp than the mob is usually worth.  I killed a mob that complete healed 8 times and get the same exp as one that complete healed none

Stinks doesn't it

He's not talking about the "end  of the world" with red walls, but the invisible ones that shouldn't be there. Try walking from the grid to Reet Retreat in Last Ditch. You'll have to jump over at least three invisible walls.

Pie314 @ 5/18/2002 8:19:26 PM (ENG shields overwrite Solder TMS 25896):
Makes sence, ENG shield nanos have very high requirements (Greater Harmonic Coocoon requires 760ish nanoskills and is enough to kill TMS10 ) and are in the same line as the soldier shields and TMS

But an ENG (or agent, or whatever) shoudl noy be able to kill a soldier's TMS shield with a shield of their own.

runey @ 5/19/2002 12:44:49 AM (25862):
I now play with that in mind. My problem (well one of the many) is that mobs randomly spawn in the front room. You know, the entrance? They just get picked up from somewhere in the mission and poof, there they are. Wheee...

Inocybe @ 5/19/2002 4:45:30 AM (25753):
Bank and bag gnomes have returned with a vengeance.

Banking has become a chore again. Most annoying.

And when you die now, all the stuff in your bags turn topsy-turvy. So now I spend any rezz time re-arranging all the stuff in the bags in my inventory ... ARGHHH.  Most annoying. Most un-fun.

Tom Sawyer @ 5/19/2002 7:08:07 AM (25316):
It actually doesn't matter what level I am.  I originally had a level 25 soldier that it started happening with as soon as I reactivated my account, so I started a new character thinking that one may have been bugged due to the long layoff and patching done in the meantime.  But now it happens with the new character who is level 10.

I've petitioned 2 times, each administrator told me to reinstall and patch the game in two different ways and neither of them have worked.  I reactivated my account because I read the game was getting very close to what it was originally intended to be, but I'm getting closer and closer to cancelling again.  I'm just now waiting on my tech support e-mail to be answered, and if they're as knowledgable as the two administrators have been this sucker is as good as in the recycle bin.

Mercatura @ 5/19/2002 8:32:08 AM (23897):
Atrox soldier = implant hell

Did I mention ranged energy?

Solitus soldier = Mk X with no timespace and only shining MC. Selfcast Steamroller at 200 with only faded clusters. Might even be able to Mk X at 200 with bright MC, expertise, a pair of Virral eggs and two of those +4 rings. Change head to shining RE then. Less attack with nova, but more with 67% RE guns.

Clanner soldier = Sleeves with Free AR and Fullauto "masteries" and imbalanced as hell for a side-item

See for yourself

400 int/sense/psy (-80 x 3) is a horrible cost for 40 more str and 32 more stam. All nanos suffer, RE suffers, treatment suffers. Can a 200 atrox soldier even put on a 200 head without a faded treatment implant? Soltius can wear decent biomech to boost treat a little more.

BTW, at high levels IP is a non-issue, unless you have to be able to use every weapon.

Mercatura @ 5/19/2002 8:34:43 AM (25477):
Mobs shouldn't have full heals. So what if players have them, we can't get 100k hp.

Same reason mobs shouldn't have single hit kill nanos. Yay, they don't. (anymore)

I can't equip my ql126 Elite Chest because it says it has requirements of 551 Stam/Str, but I am able to equip ql150 Other Parts easy.

Also have problem with pants not working correctly.

omfgz @ 5/19/2002 10:10:53 PM (Trade Bug 26003):
Trading bags is not safe. I just lost 2 bags with one ql200 elite set and some other goodies.... and this aint the first time....

So...Just moving stuff can be dangerous.... im not a rich AO dude.... so i might also hit da nice "Cancel account" button.

I also think that beeing forced to wait for 2 hours or more just to speak with a GM is just plain bad. I dont have 2 hours to sit on my ass and wait for a Gm to tell me he cant do ****. Which i have done 5 times allready.

Also zoning aint 100% safe either... went from 5M creds to 0 by zoning....

If you wanna keep your players. Fix the buggs! That way the petition queue wont be 50+ everytime you need to speak to a GM....

Kikdabucket @ 5/20/2002 2:01:47 AM (25240):
Well spoken words Nalissa.  Couldn't be truer if you tried 

I particularly like your quote.  And yes... even last night when I was doc'ing people almost died, once because the guy I was healing was on the other side of a waist-high wall toilet stall right next to me in same room - but of course 'out of range', and the other time the person was slightly inside the next room and just a little to the left of the door frame and I could only see half their body.

The reason people die is because you don't have time to find out WHY they haven't been healed yet by looking at the chat screen, and that's IF you can see that single line 'target out of range' etc. in amongst the thousands of lines flying by in a situation like this.

It's a shame that these bugs can't be fixed, LOS has such poor rules (the WORST of which has to be in rooms that have 'ditches' in them - I think Smuggler's Den is the worst ever for this) and that the promised chat windows that would give better feedback and clearer understanding of what's going on has all not been addressed yet.... and an expansion pack will probably be here (I guess with the same problems) before any of it is fixed.

Ditka @ 5/20/2002 5:09:41 AM ((&^#$*&^## Save Bug 26055):
I came SO CLOSE to quitting and uninstalling today.

Yester day I log on.  SAVE (YES YES YES I'M SURE).  Go to mission pull a mob and get two, die.

lost 5 Mil XP.

/petition, never answered, they just deleted it

Today I log on, SAVE, go to mission, first mob in kills me (was buffing, teammember accidently pulled mob).

Lost 2 Mil XP.

/petition, just to see what they say.

Of course nothing, a weeks worth of work for nothing.

Had this happen to me to the tune of 3 Mil the day after 14.0 came out.  But there is "no issue with saving".

Just typing this out makes me want to quit again.

They won't even change my name to "WhyCan't Chown Save"

Pluteaux @ 5/20/2002 5:56:27 AM (Can't pick up item! 26065):
I did a mission way out in Meetmedere, not because I wanted the reward, but because I wanted the item you pick up to get the reward. I spot the item and set my agg/def slider all the way to def so I can pick it up. The mob in the room spots me. I can't pick up the item! I try several times but can't pick up the item. I run toward the exit and lose the mob. I try to get out of attack mode by hitting escape and by trying to attack myself. Then the mob starts hitting me. But I can't see him, and I can't hit him back! He's pounding away at me, and I can't root him, I can't shoot him, I can't see him. If I was able to kill him, I could have gone back to get the item I came to the mission to get. What can I do but leave the mission, knowing I can't enter again. That mob was using an exploit! He could hit me all he wanted without being in any danger of being hit back! I want him banned!

Meligant @ 5/20/2002 4:15:41 PM (25896):
Agreed!

They need to allow us to disallow outside buffs with a setting in the preferences.  This messes up PvP and should have been in the original design.

Cosmik @ 5/20/2002 5:19:10 PM (26055):
Just some questions so I can get into the nitty-gritty of this - What save terminals were you using? The 2 million xp you say you lost today - was that ontop of what you lost yesterday, or you gained at least 2 million xp since your last death?

Perhaps i'm just an idiot (don't reply to that bit) but i've been trying for the last week to construct SOME kind of firearm (cast-off quality and below) and have met with nothing but failure.  Not that my skills are too low for the job, but because the item recepie is screwed up.  The items have NEVER gone into the construction kit in the order listed in the recepie, ever!  (I'm not even going to get into the problems i've had trying to convert the mausser particle streamer into a chemical based weapon)  As i've lost about a week worth of productivity and roughly 65k in credits and STILL can't find a solution to these problems I'd REALLY appreciate any help offered.

Ok, just stumbled across another thread in this vein, and that covers pretty much all the same things i've said here, so i'm gonna ask a different question.  How do you modify your existing weapon?  I'm well aware that you need a hacker tool to crack open whatever firearm you're working with, but then what?

Loved your fix on the places in tir where ppl got stuck sometimes. Instead of fixing it correctly you threw up 1000000000000 feet high and FAT invisible walls everywhere, making it impossible to fly around in your yalmaha or jump around. How long did that take you 10sec? Cheap fix like always.

I found a map in a mission, I think it was 4holes, and I guess I didnt have it cause just for the heck of it i right clicked it and it said it uploaded.
But next time I went to newland city it says I dont have a map! Yet I can see the map listed when I get info on myself. Outside of the city is fine, its just the city.
Not that it matters that much to me, I know my way around the city well, and its not that big, but I figured i'd report it.

Ditka @ 5/20/2002 9:51:55 PM (26055):
Save Terms:

Avalon

Tir Grid

BrokenShores Home (west and east)

this is NOT happening all the time.  I did succesfully save 1.2 or so mil XP Sunday mid-morning (US time).

The loss is not cumulative.

But, since 14.0 rolled, on three occasions I have lost XP after being SURE that I saved.  (I know how that sounds, but understand, I am meticulous about this sort of thing.  I KNOW that I saved, and that the client said I did.)

First was 3ish Mil the day of or after 14.0 rolled.  Second was last friday to the tune of 5.2 or so.  Thrid was Saturday for about 2.2 or 2.3.

The only common denominator is that all of those save points are "high traffic" (and high lag) areas.  But in each case the client thought that I had succesfully saved.

I started screenshotting my saves after the first occourance, but when everything was ok for a few weeks I stopped.  I wish I had kept doing it, but spilt milk and all...

There are different maps for Newland (the zones outside NLC) and a different map for Newland City, I believe. Check out the map shop.

The first time, I 'really' thought about hitting the 'Cancel' button.

Maximilian @ 5/21/2002 9:33:37 AM (Several Engineer/pet annoyances 26214):
I want to ask, if this only happens to me or if somebody else is affected. Furthermore this a sort of bug report, as I don't get answers to mails these days. (hint?!)

I have a lvl60 OT Engi (Vermeer). I regularly team with a good friend, who plays neutral chars. This results in the following problems:

1) Inability to buff my pet. Whenever we are in a 25% gas area, 4 Holes, Stret East, etc. I cannot buff my pet! I get the message, that I can cast only nanos on 'friendly' targets. Well, I can cast buffs (AC, DS, what-so-ever) on my pal, but not on my pet - cute, isn't it? I still can use the trimmers, but no nano formulas - doh.
Some observations, that might help. I get the message, that target side is neutral, when I team with my friend - fine so far. But obviously my pet doesn't recognize this change and stay's omni. In 75% gas area (Clon****), I can buff my pet.

2) Pet's still loose the short time trimmer effects after zoning. (Energy to 'xxx').

3) I am pretty convinced, that the long time trimmers stay, but would like to have some sort of control -> /pet report. Could you integrate the actual trimmer settings into the report?

4) It still happens, that my pet get's attacked by Omni guards. Must be some weird thing with the trimming. This effect usually happens after finishing a mission and is unrelated to suprression gas area. Neutral guards never attack, OT's do from time to time. I couldn't track it down to a solid basis, but I guess, it's is related to the taunting trimmer and some Damage and Reflection shields I use on my bot. Very annoying one - already reported twice - no reaction. 

So long,

Max(imilian)

Yup, got it again yesterday for the first time in a LONG time.

Teammate goes down, grabs the item for me (my mission), comes back.  We decide to kill the boss before completing, mission crashes, just as I zone down into the boss room.

I respawn first.  Thankfully, I respawned in the room with the boss teleporter (one silver lining in this all).  I now can solo vets, and I took out the one on the room.  My team comes back, only to find that the item for the mission is not in anyone's inventory, nor in the boss room.  No token, hooray!!!!

Scince mid febuary and the 13.8 patch i have been unable to chat ingame. it was discovered long ago that it was due to me having to run on windows 95. I emailed funcom back and forth for nearly a month with them telling me to download this and that to try to fix and it was to no help. About a month ago Funcom emailed me and told me it would be some time before the bug was fixed and i should probobly cancel my account. I did for a short time but this game is like a crack addiction and i just cant stay away. This bug has severly hampered my gameplay. Not only can i not chat ingame, but also i can not create a new charactor, or even trade money to people, i am pleading with you guys to give me a bump to plead with funcom to get this bug fixed. because there are so few Windows 95 users FC told me that it was a low priority bug and would be treated so.... ill be posting this message on all the boards i can because i am desparete to get this bug fixed. Funcom im begging you, PLEASE FIX THIS!

kyrsan @ 5/21/2002 10:03:50 PM (Various Bugs 26332):
Here is a list of bugs I've noticed:

1. Find/Retrive item missions.  3 missions where the item spawned in the wall.

Mission Settings:
Bad
Chaos
Hidden
Money

2 Missions in Newland (Map) (Newland Desert in mission term)
1 Mission in Wailing Wastes

All times the GM was not able to teleport the item from the wall.

"I am very sorry about the inconvience but there really isn't anything I can do" is getting old.

2. Bank bug revisted.

I didn't see this one on the board but this is probably caused more from a dropped packet or something.

I click on the item in my bank.  Phunny.  It's not in my backpack.  I click on another item in the bank.  The first appears and the second disappears.  Zoning corrects this.

I click on the item in my bank.  Phunny.  It's not in my backpack.  I click on another item in my bank.  This items appears nicely.  I zone and all is corrected.

3. In limbo zoning

About 10% of the time I will drop connection while zoning.  The client doesn't crash nor does it report as being dropped.  The only thing I notice is the clock starts moving again but no life from the server.  I then Ctrl-Esc the game and end task it.  I launch AO again and my character is sitting in the new zone without a logout message.

Drusillus @ 5/22/2002 12:34:13 AM (25240):
I'll add another one to the mix.

When you use a Divert Energy to HitPoints trimmer on your bot, the bot's HP bar will go up, then immediately fall back down.  So eventually when your pet's health is back to 100%, his bar will only show 80% for example.

Definitely not as serious but annoying nonetheless.

Ratty @ 5/22/2002 6:41:33 AM (26141):
I appreciate the suggestion but im actually not a noob. 
I said I had the map, as in it was showing me the minimap ever since i got it at level 10 or so, now at level 130 I suddently dont have a map of newland city. Newland desert, the zone thats outside the city is fine, just the city itself now wont show anything. Ever since I uploaded that map i found in a mission chest. And newland city shows in my map list when I get info on myself so the game says I have the map, just for some reason it wont render it.

And I want to reiterate that I dont really care.  I am just reporting this as a bug in case funcom wants to look into fixing it, as unlikely as that may be, I cant very well complain about bugs not getting fixed if im not doing my part by reporting them.

Tyndel @ 5/22/2002 11:56:15 AM (25511):
2 notes on this invisibility problem that might help you deal with them a bit.
 with teammembers going invis, you can not cast any nanos on them.. nor trade with them(not that the tradepart is a big problem) But you can hit them with teamheals/teambuffs.

When mob goes invis, you can target the player being attacked, and do a /assist to target the mob self.. you can then attack the mob.. but you cant hit the mob with specials or nanos.. (get that out of range message).

In both cases moving out of visual range(usually 2-3 rooms away) fixes the problem.. 
It is a friggin shame that we have to resort to this kind of "trick" though to get around this bug, and woe to the nanocaster who solos a mission and runs into this problem.

NB.. This seems to happen way more frequently when the mob have pathing problems.. I.e you pull a mob from a room back to group, and he tries to exit the room 1 meter left of the door(the silly twit), then he VERY often suddenly goes invis and start shooting cloaked.

NNB.. There is a LOT of items in missions that makes for lack of LOS.. Like shelves, tables you can walk into++.. These might be a lifesaver if you walk into them while being killed by a mob , as he stops shooting you. BUT.. mobs walk into these too at times.. And then you are fubared.  Then you cant shoot on the mob, since no LOS.. but for some reason.. the mob doesnt worry about LOS.. so he keeps shooting happily.

Shaolinwolf @ 5/22/2002 12:17:19 PM (Alt-Tab Bug 26416):
Hi,

I hope this makes sense, I've not heard of it happening to anyone else but I thought I would post it anyway.

While running I sometimes alt-tab to another application for a min, I hear myself speed up ingame (footsteps etc...), alt-tab back into the game and see that the mountain 3 mins runs away is infront of me now, then suddenly I'm whisked back to where I should be receiving falling damage!

Happens most time I alt-tab out for 20 secs or more.  Oh and the stupid bug when you get catapulted into the air for no apparent reason landing to receive more falling damage! (mostly in BS)

I'm not bothered, most I have received is just over 120 dmg, not much for a 88 enf, but still kinda weird and a bug I think.

OK I have the same problem with trading.

It seems to happen ALOT (Almost everytime) When I am trading in a General (any) Store.  I have to go outside (Re-Zone) to see the item in my inventory.  IN all I would say 85% of the time this is the case.  Also When doing something and a overflow window pops up and i take the item out of it WITHOUT closing the window i will lose anything that pops open a "New" overflow window.  Now before you say i need to free up space in my pack or some other silly response like that if that was the case then there should be NO  overflow windows.  But the programs inability to open a new overflow window when the old one is empty is a bug.  It is a bug that can be avoided yes but it is a bug none the less.  

ALSO: I know this is not in context of this thread but the randomly missing macros everytime i log in is a real joke.  Maybe the programers working on the "NEW" expansion pack can come back and get some of the bugs out of the original game.  Oh and just to let you in on a little secret Work is Work if you are bored with your job Quit and find a new one else stop whining (that is for the Bored people that got moved to the new expansion development team)

Instead of concentrating on adding new features please try to fix the existing ones.  Al in all I can say that this game has advanced 100 fold since the days of beta when i played 2 times and said your nowhere near ready for release.  You have all been doing a GREAT job fixing a almost unplayable game to what it is today but please don't let the Expansion hype created by all the other MMORPG's get you off from your critical path which should be to make the EXISTING game completely playable.

Thanks

Your only hope is to get to a level where you can do a QL 60 (exactly) mission, and then hunt for one.  Don't level until you get it... then go get and enjoy your working FoL.

jonjon @ 5/22/2002 9:12:27 PM (25115):
unfortunately, i am level 129 and have no hopes of rolling a mission that low. if you come across someone who roles a ql60 or a ql200 mission for FoL, i will tip generously for the chance to enter the mission and get the item. Send a tell to Hilani on RK1.

p00finger @ 5/22/2002 10:26:55 PM (25040):
I've been plagued with this identical problem.  I found an oddball fix...but by no means a solution.  If you have a mission in your mission list, simply right-click and load it up to your map (release the click on the middle mapgraph icon).  BOOM!  All mouse lag is gone.  This sometimes works if you make add something to your knowledge base and load it the same way.  The former works much better.

If I don't have a mission and a terminal is convenient, I pick one up and hold on to it...if I'm out hunting or whatever.

It works for me, I'll let the FC peeps run with this one.

Go to start thinking in % of the entire player base. Like 10% or so.  Funcom seems from what I've read on this forum not susceptible to this kind of black mail on a scale where it involes a dozen or so person.

xenomorph @ 5/23/2002 5:09:00 PM (26055):
When I logged the night before I scanned in w athens, next day log on get a mission in BS  scan in BS go inside mission die, and lost 1 mil exp. And Died in the 1st room so it's not like I gained the exp in the mission then died. Also this was before they funcom moved the scan term in BS, so it was awhile back. 

Difference with my story was I didn't bother to peti because I'm sick of hearing "Sorry we can't do anything about that." If I knew I would have had my exp returned to me I would have peti.

Strycker @ 5/23/2002 6:42:28 PM (25040):
The cursor is AO software-controlled. Why not let the mouse move around under OS control the usual way? If for some reason the mouse does need to be under direct client control, well, heck, spawn an independent thread for it. I ought to be able to click on "map" or "options" or whatever regardless of whether the main window is lagging waiting for data from the server or waiting for graphics to trickle out of the database. But in fact when the network connection hangs the UI hangs as well. This is not a good design, IMO.

Tyndel @ 5/23/2002 8:42:34 PM (24835):
having evade nanos stack might be a bit over the top.. 
 i mean.. 
+78? from the fixer runbuff.. 
+120 from the MA reduce inertia..
+80 from the NT dark movement
+110 from the trader quantum uncertanity.
+60 from the mp anticipation of retaliation..
adding all of those together gives you a whooping 
448 evades.. thats a bit much
Even having just some stack might be slightly unbalancing.. Ohwell.. not that i'd mind too much though

Oberan @ 5/23/2002 9:16:16 PM (24835):
dont forget that the ma's velocity nano cancels free movement (adventurer is 100 ma is 70)

And dont forget parrot form gives 170 evades 

too bad you cant fight with it!!!

DaveDread @ 5/23/2002 11:47:03 PM (24835):
Hehe , I dunno... a 440ish evade buffing frenzy might actually make you dodge a bullet or two... 8P

Nah, but I do think some of them should stack, not all.

Take RI and AoR for a whooping 180 for example. That's not unreasonable if you look at the NCU count methinks. Atm, theres no way you can get evades up high enough to be useful in PvP or even in PvM unless you fight mobs way under your current level. I can dodge greens on max def, and I have 900ish evades. A yellow hits me every time. 

But yeah, the stacking should be looked at in general. The QL of nano shouldn't take precedence over the effect.

One of my team mates lost 5mil exp to the same bug a few days ago. He had saved at BS terminal near the temple.

I always click the terminal 3 times to be sure it won't happen to me since I first heard of this bug. It may be due to lag, thinking you're at the terminal saving while you're 100m away and only the client registers the save and not the server.

Mummu @ 5/24/2002 10:39:31 AM (some thing I find everywhere, and wich I realy hates 26701):
there are some things wich happens in every game and wich I realy dont like:

I can climb a hugh mountain, but on top is the end of the zone, and no border, and i can see mobs going through this not existing portal, I want although going to these place 

clipping problems, ok some are at places where a normal player dont go, but some are at places 

RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG STREET!!!

or closed borders, I hate them, I have a mission in the west (2-3 zones away, I like running)
BUT:

- NO BORDER

or:
- closed border (a red one)
- 10 deep red mobs right behind the portal (wich i find after   hours of searching
- they also like to "camp" near grid stations, but only the mobs with the highest lvl.


I have taken some screenshots from the places I found the last days, and wich I dont like:

www.uni-koblenz.de/~limburg/pics/AO/****s/

4 and 6 are not existing zone portals at places where they would be verry nice

place 5 I found after zoning in some miles away from the places where I zoned out
(I climbed to the left of 4 the wall, and went through the first portal i found)

Mummu @ 5/24/2002 11:32:37 AM (26701):
and what just happend:


I was in the zone north-west of nl desert,
ready to zone back to nld,
i looked on the overview map: ok, i m right below the "w" of newland.

i zoned to nld, a little look at the map:
i m right below the "n" of newland (not the "N").

??????????

now again:

these zones are like squares in wich rk is diveded, cause the server cant handle everything at once, right?
so, if i zone out below the "w" i have to zone in below the "w", right?

Bionitrous @ 5/24/2002 5:39:48 PM (26300):
You don't have to upgrade yer Win95 system, but you can see if your stepdad will let you set up a dual-boot where you have both Win98 and Win95 on the same system. 

System Commander and other fine programs you can purchase at most major software retailers make it a snap to set up your system to ask you which operating system you want to run when starting up your computer.

If you've been playing AO this long without chat, I think you oughta give dual booting a try.

You're other option is a bit more expensive but might be more acceptable to your stepdad.  Get one of those trays where you can slide the hard drive out and quickly swap it for another.  If the PC is off you slide your hard drive in and you're good to go with whatever you want.  Next time it's step dad's turn to use the computer, he puts in his hard drive and starts up the system and gets Win95 in all it's glory.

Octopuss @ 5/25/2002 8:23:42 AM (Few VERY annoying bugs 26845):
I reactivated my account about 2 weeks ago and realised there STILL are the same bugs as in the time AO was launched.
So:
1) if I use an item while running (upload token or reload weapon) I'll start "sliding" - this looks extremely dumb. Btw monsters do the same.

2) if my inventory is full and I finish a mission, the stuff I receive will appear in separate window saying I need to free some space - that is ok, but if I click any of the new items, one random item in MY BACKPACK DISAPPEARS !!! This is not good at all !!!

3) this is maybe not real bug, but some monsters seem very stupid. Sometimes if I run a bit from them they will start running around me, or run out of the room. Or melee-type NPC's. I was fighting one, run a bit back, not much, but I got from range of his weapon. And what he did was running through myself to my back. They do this every time. Uhm...

That's about everything I can think of at the moment. The 1) and 2) really need some fix, imo...

Anyway, I still put some of my stuffs in it but I can't retrieve this stacked backpack from the bank now.  An ARK  acknowledged that problems with backpacks exist and will be dealt with in a future patch.

Alright, when you're in a dungeon or mission, mez works fine.  They stop.  They don't attack.  Wow.

But when I was hunting around the SW Mines in Lush Fields I saw what seems to be the gayest bug ever.  Everytime I mezzed a mutant that came on me while I was fighting another -- they don't stop following you.  He's mezzed, apparently 'asleep', but somehow he can haul ass and keep up with me NO MATTER WHAT.

And what's even more stupid - After the mez is taken off by my pet thwacking him, EVEN IF HE TAKES THE AGGRO THE !*&@(*&$^!@(*&$@$ MONSTER KEEPS FOLLOWING YOU!  Now I don't know if this is intended, but if it is, hell, I might as cancel my account now because I'm not looking forward to anymore fun features like this.

Cosmik @ 5/27/2002 2:53:03 AM (26055):
It's safe to say it isn't an issue with the scanner themselves. I travelled around this week, checking out those scanners (and others in the same playfield) and all were working correctly. Plus, these scanners store the information of other people (and you sometimes, as you say). As mentioned above, quite possibly an issue with client vs server - which I'll look into. For my own information, do you normally run right up to the scanner, scan, then run away again? Or perhaps run up to the scanner, take a little longer by targetting it, then scanning, and then running off?

Cosmik @ 5/27/2002 2:55:06 AM (27004):
Does this seem to only happen with the mutants at the SW Mines, or any outdoor MOBs?

gnuman @ 5/27/2002 2:56:50 AM (27004):
Its only a visual bug. He seems to follow you, but if you run around a bit he is suddenly out of range. Actually this can happen inside missions aswell.

Atwight014 @ 5/27/2002 3:10:41 AM (27004):
It happens on all outside things, and never inside (unless they'll run to my position, and never move again.)

Yes, I know if I run far enough they'll just randomly disappear, but if you don't, then as far as the game is concerned they are there, because the aggro will keep jumping between the pet, and more often, me.  Beyond that, AOE things still nail even if I'm a good amount away from their original position when I shot the mez, so I wouldn't quite call that a visual bug.

On top of that --- you guys know that if you try to mez something, then charm it while it's mezzed, the charm won't work, it'll just start attacking you and you can't recharm it (it still thinks it's charmed or something I think.)  Only happened twice to me, because I never tried doing it again (deathtrap).

Cosmik @ 5/27/2002 3:12:51 AM (27004):
True. Happens a bit at both the popular mines in Lush Fields. Just covering all angles to make sure we haven't got some kind of new super mutant.

teisis1 @ 5/27/2002 5:06:30 AM (Treatment machines 27050):
I didnt see it on this board but im sure everyone hates the treatment machine bug that wont let you swap out implants once the treatment machine effect has has expired without zoning.
If you click the machine and try to swap a implant it says you cant without technical assistance. Why is this bug still in the game funkcom?! Its been in the game since i started playing and that was 8 months ago. Also fix the team health bar window bug thats been in the game forever. Hello? do you hear me funkcom? or is this just a post you'll never read?

*bump* even though this hasn't struck me (yet). Crap like this shouldn't ever happen.

And what would targeting the save terminal first do?

Cosmik @ 5/27/2002 6:17:57 AM (27050):
Just a clarification - you are only trying to swap out implants while still in the shop? 

Onto the second point - the team health bar issue is being addressed in 14.4. Refer here for more information.

You 100% sure you got the "Character stored" message? In laggy areas I sometime hear the normal save sound only to get a "To far away" message at times, if so I try again until char stored.

FireC @ 5/27/2002 9:39:26 AM (27050):
Yes that bug has been around since, uh, I'm sure someone remembers the patch number. You use treatment machine, the effect expires and if you click it again you'll basically get the effect but it still won't let you switch implants. Zoning fixes it but you still need to wait out that 5 minute penalty even if it did not work like it was supposed to. *Very* annoying.

Krneki @ 5/27/2002 9:52:04 AM (27050):
You don't have to wait 5 min penalty anymore tho, still pretty annoying when you need to zone every 5 min..

Darkbane @ 5/27/2002 1:09:57 PM (26055):
Well, it could well be a client/server issue. I've had occasions in missions on testlive where the playfield server stops or dies. You can still run around the area of the mission the client has cached, but that is about it. No attacking, no sitting, no casting nanos, mobs just stand there... anything that relies on server side confirmation will not happen. I'd guess that by being a bit less hasty, and ensuring the scanner is targetted, that this helps reduce the likelyhood of this happening.

Of course this may not be what is happening in your case, but it is the most likelt explanation. The problem here is that the client does some things to take the load off the server and help reduce effects of latency and lag, so you may think you've saved (because the client has said so), but not actually (because the server never got the message). Maybe Cosmik could indicate if the display of the message in the chat window is a guarantee that the server got the message and that the client got the reply.

Mona @ 5/27/2002 4:50:22 PM (25511):
This weekend, there have been 3 terribles deaths in  my hunting group due to this bug.  Two of them were mine and I lost a total of 1.2 mil exp./

The problem is slightly different but the cause is probably similar.  I was pulling for a full team.  My husband was the Doctor (This information is important because we compared screens.)  I went out to one room away (1 empty room between me and the team) and came back with a mob.  Noone could see me.  Noone could assist me.  Noone could target me.  When I died, they found my body in the empty room - I had never entered the room.  On my screen, both of us were back in the room.  On my husband's screen, nothing was going on, except that I was invisible - my name is blacked out.  

Now you can blame it on lag, but it is not lag.  A.  It does not happen even when there was terrible lag.  B. It last long enough that if there was such lag, I should have been disconnected.  C.  It usually happens when one of the rooms have potential LOS problems, such as conference room with big tables, caves with a pole in the middle or a pond, etc.

The bad part, is that you never know when this is going to happen.  And when it does, it means sure death of the puller.  

This really needs to be looked into.  IN the meantime, if anyone knows any tricks to deal with this please share.  I am rather new to AO and I enjoy pulling a lot.  This bug really makes it unfun for me.

Well I searched the whole place for the item a couple of times and found nothing. Is this a bug or am I just doing something wrong. I really hope missions aren't bugged still *sigh*

thx for the help

Darkbane @ 5/28/2002 12:51:32 AM (26055):
Would seem odd the packet getting lost twice, with that sort of packet loss level, the game would be noticably unplayable. So, probably not that then... Best leave it to Cosmik.

Ditka @ 5/28/2002 2:29:12 AM (26055):
Its not the packet getting "lost" twice.

Its the same reason you have people pull invisible mobs, your teammates go invisibile after you split up in missions, it takes you 3 minutes to go up the elevators (lifts) in the grid, etc.

The client assumes too much.
or
The network traffic compression code really just doesn't work sometimes.
or
Both.

If my client assumes that the save went thru twice (very close together) and assumes that the server got that, and the server goes "huh?" then WHAM, I lose XP next time I die.

This always happens in high-traffic areas.
We ALL know that you can spend 2-5 minutes trying to zone into or out from Broken Shores on a bad day (and that Cosmik has a sticky asking if people see "lag" there  ).  How many times have you had to  rezone mid-mission because your client is totally out of sync and you're getting wacky stuff going on?

The worst part is that when I quit, they'll looks at my char time and decide that I quit because I leveled too fast, and they'll use me (as a meaningless stastic, I'm not thinking me personally  )  as part of the justification to nerf the player base some more.
When really I would have played AO for two or three years, thru this hellish time, to (HOPEFULLY) when they realise that they need to make the game more FUN, not more difficult.

I would have, if I thought ANYONE outside of Cos and CZ gave a damn about the player base.

Ashuras @ 5/28/2002 2:33:38 AM (26055):
Next time. Try this.

Sit Down -> Save (check for the message.. not just the sound) -> Stand Up.

Just to be sure u're in sync all the time.

Don't forget to check that credits had been deducted too. Just to be sure.

Ditka @ 5/28/2002 6:03:13 AM (26055):
The credits are deducted on the client side, so thats irrelevenant.

Also, F that.

I'm continuing to screenshot all saves and save twice, when FC refuses to refund the Xp next time, I'll just quit.

Darkbane @ 5/28/2002 7:48:02 AM (26055):
Hmmm, well given FCs current no refunds policy, I suspect we'll be saying goodbye 

The problem isn't so much that the client does too much (clients in these types of games do tend to do a fair bit to minimise lag effects), but that once sync is lost, it doesn't get re-synced very well. If the client checked its data set every now and then, or even just different bits of it on a more frequent basis, it might notice something was amiss.

But I'd try the sit down, save, stand-up suggestion. If you can sit down or stand up, you have communication with the server as that action needs confirmation before the client will perform it, so that at least checks your ok there. If that isn't the issue, then...

bever @ 5/28/2002 8:57:12 AM (25110):
I discovered that I get more exp reward on 3rd mission in sertain setting (lrlllr). So I deleted one of the previouse missions and got a new 3rd and then deleted the last not 3rd and got a new mission. Now I had three missions that kind where all 3rd, atleast they all had 600k exp reward (on 1th mission I get 400k reward and 3rd i get 570k, im lvl 155 and missions in BS).

I'm sure active MAs appreciate their full range of Special Moves, the anims have all been fixed. Angel of Night might have a ****ty refresh time, but it looks damn cool.  Wondering if any other MA moves use the same anim, but are viable combat options...

Working on Dry Wastes when I have time. Look out for Masked Commandoes & a drop on Omni-0! Likely expansion pack material though, not on the patch horizon yet.

I was just trying to remember the name of that restaurant a couple of days ago. BURRITO HEAVEN! Damn Chipotle rules, its probably the number one thing I miss about Texas. Oh wait, the Ghenkis Khan mongolian grille was good too! And Fuddruckers!

We're turning this concept into a static dungeon at the mo. Should be level 5-25 in all startup cities.

This happened to me yesterday... I saved at 20k, and it didn't register. I died later and found myself in Broken Shore set back several million xp.

Nullifax @ 5/29/2002 4:15:44 PM (27004):
This happens to me all the time especially at Shades and Claws in PM.

I start run low on nanos and after killing a bunch of mobs and sit down to recharge.  It says I can't because I'm in a fight.  So I stand there and wait for the one mob that couldn't find me to come from 70 miles away to finally get into view.  Well it turns out he brought 3 friends.  So I mezz the first one, then when I try to switch to target the second one I can't.  Why can't I?  Because the mezzed mob continues to stick to me and thus stands right on the same spot as his buddies.  As a result, I the only way I know I've targeted the other mobs is when I mezz and they actually stop attacking.  This especially becomes a problem when I wind up actually just retargeting the first one and I fumble, and you guessed it, the fumbled nano breaks mezz.  90% of the time, when I have stacked shades attacking me, I die because of this stupid visual bug.

Bionitrous @ 5/29/2002 5:59:17 PM (4164):
I had a dream I was at a guild meeting last Monday.  In it, we all said we were getting bored with the game and probably wouldn't be playing so much anymore.  I remember I said 'Hey, maybe if we did something different, it would ****e things up a bit!'  I suggested that we go to Smuggler's Den on some midweek day the following week at an off hour we could have some fun fighting side-by-side as brothers in arms like we used to do and have a blast and maybe even get some decent loot.  Afterwords we would talk for an hour about the different things we saw and fought along the way, lament our deaths, and drink to our victories.

This was my dream.

The reality:  We get rooted and killed as we try to get to the entrance.  Someone tells us when we are in the zone-in room that this dungeon was 'their's' and that we shouldn't even bother to continue.  We move in and some level 200 character proceeds to bring the whole dungeon into the room we're fighting in and /terminate herself.  We regroup and this happens twice more.  As we start killing things, a couple of 180's start to fight the same things we do and manages to get the experience for every kill.  We make it to the end of the cave part of the dungeon and there's no epic encounter for us.

We all give FunCom a virtual /flip and log off having learned that the game is all about camping and interminable mission after mission until you log in only once a week and then finally never log in anymore.

I remember having a subsequent dream and it's just me and the Guild President talking in chat as he's in some mission with some group of people he doesn't even know and I'm running some twink alt Nanomage Enforcer at lvl 30.  We realize that's it's just been him every so often in a pickup group and me trying to relive some of the fun of actually having options to do things.

Then it fades to black ....


Almost every post that Cranium makes is worth about a thousand Cosmik and Cz posts put together.  

No personal offense towards either, it's just that 'I'll get back to you on this', 'We're looking into this', and 'What do you think about this?' followed by stark silence gets to you after a while.

As I said, it's probably not their fault, they just don't seem to have access to any information regarding how the game works or what direction it's going.  Making the best of a bad situation it seems and trying to keep the situation light while things keep getting darker with respect to having any fun in-game.

Everytime I see the Cranium post either here or FCranium post over at the Vault, there's value to be found in the words.  Everything he's said has come to pass or not as stated.

This is the feedback we want on the boards.

Why is it so hard to get a response to such issues as what FunCom is doing to fix the camping issues with the Lab Director or Mantis Queen, for example?  Goddamnit, this is IMHO the biggest issue killing the game for those of us bored with our millionth mission who don't have the resources of some uber-guild at our beck and call.   

This issue is HUGE and they must have SOME clue as to what they are doing to fix it.  People leaving left and right because they simply can't do another mission.  Yet, we have Smuggler's and Camelot that might keep them interested and yet the game mechanics make it a waste of time to even get a group of friends together to do a dungeon crawl on your Saturday afternoon.

I'm abosulutely BEGGING for someone who knows what is going on at FunCom to tell us what is going to happen and when with respect to my group of guys and all the other groups of guys and gals who want to go to Smuggler's Den and enjoy the camaraderie that guildship brings and make stories, leaving us able to log out with smiles on our faces.

Bionitrous @ 5/29/2002 6:04:53 PM (4164):
I love the idea of having the Subways be static adventuring areas for low level characters.

If it hasn't been already envisioned, I would suggest interlinking all these various Subways into a supersystem.

Just as you have the gate at the end of Smuggler's Den, I think it would be wise and realistice to have connection points between the Subways in Newland, Borealis, Tir, and the Omni areas.

It would serve as a nice way for low level characters to fight their way into enemy territory through a hostile environment.  As it stands now, if a Clanner or Neutral wants to join the Corporation or vice-versa, it's either a silly run through Broken Shores or a less than memorable Beacon Warp from a high level Engineer.

The image of the Morlock's from H.G. Wells' 'The Time Machine' comes to mind, where ghoulish mutants and outcast citizens have taken up residence.  A perfectly scary trial by fire for any lowbie who simply wants to explore or 'run the gauntlet' to get to the other side.

For the final icing on the cake, and just to put some strength behind my assertation that I'm not a carebear, I think that the merger area of the Clan and Omni sections of these interlinked 'dungeons' should be 25% or 0% gas to provide an experience similar to what Camelot provides for the 120+ crowd.

I'm running on a 1GHz athlon. GeForce3.  768 megs of ram.
4 way interleave, manually assigned video memory addressing, 256meg video aperature, side band addrressing on (verified that DX inputs faster with it), ata100 HD with a seperate ata100 HD with a 12 GIG page file on it.  WinXP with all the services and drivers tweaked. 3 megabit downstream 300k upstream cable connection off of a business class router (live downtown, play at night).

I spent over a year doing tech support (security admin for a 300K user network now) and I KNOW what I'm doing.

This game is F'ing laggy as hell on judgement day.

Strycker @ 5/30/2002 6:07:29 AM (Invulnerable boss mob? 27560):
My team just blitzed a level 186 team mission we wanted to complete by killing the boss. Sadly, the boss proved to be invulnerable to energy damage for some reason, and of course our two best damage-dealers were soldiers with novaflows.

Over the last month or so we have defeated quite a number of level 180-190 bosses, so we have some experience with these mobs. We were not for example, simply shocked at the boss's insane hit point totals, but were clearly aware that the soldiers' weapons were doing no damage, while for example the MP pet, the MA, and myself (an NT) were doing some small amounts of damage (through some kind of huge absorption shield) though not enough to actually defeat the boss in any reasonable amount of time. The three of us tried for a while (not even nudging the HP bar with my pathetic QL 189 nuke damage) but eventually without the soldiers ever accruing any aggro the boss turned on our doc and killed him before he could escape, so we aborted the combat.

The henchmen were calmed for the fight so it was easy to see that the soldiers were doing no damage. They zoned down the elevator and came back with no change to their ability to harm the boss, so I have to assume that the boss really had 100% absorption of energy damage over the five minute period in which we futilely tried to fight it.

IMO this has to be a bug. It would be easy for a team to predominantly deal one damage type such as energy, melee, or projectile damage, and if you make team mission boss mobs which are completely immune to these damage forms, you are just giving people yet another reason to get frustrated with these painfully drawn out and repetitious missions.

coldbeer @ 5/30/2002 11:35:32 AM (Server down! 27595):
Today May 30 servers went down.
There was no warning of them going down nothing just went down.In description says very important for servers to be down.

Now u want to tell me that u did not have time to write a very simple line to tell us about servers going down?

I am stuck in boss room and as we all know when i log back on the mission will be fully spawned so i will most likely die and loose a large amount of XP....
My mission was a small one only 3 or 4 mill i dont even wanna thing if some team went to avalon for team mission and they went LD in boss room we are talking about 10 - 12 mill xp loss
Maybe this time u could reimburse the xp....cos this is clear to ur fault!
If not well u loose another customer ...

sarangas @ 5/30/2002 12:04:26 PM (27595):
Im in the exact same situation,only ill stand to lose 1mil xp.This is the 3rd time ive been whacked like this.But what bothers me the most is the lying that funcom has chosen to employ to cover up poor behavior.I think they realize now they chose the wrong protocol for an online game of this magnitude.Can't turn back now and the exploits will never go away.One fix creates another and so on.I think they are slowly easing in bits of 14.2,setting it up as it were.So I gather we are still beta testing for these retards and paying for it to boot.

If pets are gettign stuck on doors, please do tell me what the door looks like (or post a screenshot). 
			
		
	
Cosmik, 

The problem with pet pathing is everywhere. I know this sounds bad and doesnt say which doors or hallways...but Ive been playing missions like crazy....and the pets get stuck everywhere there is somekind of door or furniture. The worst parts are the tables.
Another thing that the pet does is run away from me if I dont look at him...this happens often. If I get attacked the pet dissapears far far away and gets stuck somewhere. Pet pathing is so bad in general in a mission that my hopes of getting them back are at 1%. If Im lucky they will warp to my position sometime during the mission...but that isnt always the case. So..Im a meta using a hammer and not even trying to get the pets back since they would get stuck after 1 room anyway.

I dont think that the only solution would be to fix some doors and removing some tables and chairs....there will always be some kind of bug left somewhere that will be apparant in live game. 
I strongly suggest that the devteam takes a look at the "/pet warp" command suggestion many have talked about. Even if the pets would get stuck people would just warp them to their position and noone would care much that they get stuck.
I dont know a thing about programming...but this warp command suggestion sound much easier than remodelling missions to correct pet pathing somewhat.
Would really love to hear what the devteam thinks of the "/pet warp" command suggestion 

Great to have u out there Cosmik

#*$&^#$(*#&^(*^#$&#^$!!!!!!

 

Demons get stuck on EVERY TYPE DOOR IN THE GAME.
Not every time, but at LEAST one in five in the mission I turn around and go back for the demon.
Then theres all the chairs and such.
Then theres the FACT that mezz pets path PERFECTLY 99% of the time.

Duplicate the mezz pet pathing to evry other pet in the game.

Yehezkel @ 5/30/2002 7:08:54 PM (26055):
I suppose not for every single person, but it's awfully laggy for a lot of people. I have a 620/90 adsl connection, P 933, Geforce 3, 512 RAM, recent install of Win 2k professional with all the correct and updated drivers etc.... certainly a good enough machine to run the game in all its glory. Good enough to exceed any requirements if the game is run with all of the bells and whistles at their maximum settings.

Yet still it lags to a slideshow on a regular basis, the ping drops into the thousands, I get disconnected more often than I'd like, the mouse lag makes it difficult to click on anything...

Servers have now been running for 7 houers with grid down and 99% of ppl that cant zone, chat lag random from 20sec up to 10min, WTF ARE YOU SMOKING IN THERE ???? GO FIX THE SERVERS.

i cant trade.. i cant get to those i need to trade vith.. im stuck in the grid, ppl dont wanna go into the grid to trade with me..actually.. ppl dont want to go anywhere..or ..CAN'T

emergency fixing the servers.. no warnings.. just BUM crash.. 40min later servers back and ****ed.. and still running after 7 houers.. GOD DAMMIT

Just a clarification - you are only trying to swap out implants while still in the shop?
			
		
	
Yes im still in the shop. You can only use the treatment machines
once per zone into the area the machine is in.
Try it out yourself. Use the treatment machine wait 5 min and click it again. Guess what? you have to zone to swap implants. Now lets fix this problem. Thank you.

Before you log back in set your Computer Clock AHEAD 24 hours.

When you log in your PC will believe the mission has timed out and will put you OUTSIDE the mission.

Pass around as a way to prevent log in death.  Enjoy.

I'm not really mad but I want an answer to this "too common" weekly WORLD-WIDE bug.

Description:  You are doing your usually when the world just stops.  You can chat but can't sit,heal,cast,and at times not move.  You don't get any more battle messages and most animations going on around you will continue as to what your client was last displaying.  Then after a length of time, the world will either "catch up" in super fast mode and you can continue on OR the world disconnects your from your guild discussion about how 1/2 the guild is about to die and they can't heal/run away.

We (the customers of AO) want to know A) What this bug is? B) Can we detect when it is coming? and C) what and when you are going to do something about it.  We don't need the "we are working on it response".  We want to know what it is first and then you can try buying us off with "we are working on it".

Thank you in advance for your complete disclosure and honesty.

Without trying to sound like I'm a know it all, its most likely lag and not a bug. This is one of the few games that allows you to actually say something in game and show it in the chat window even if your side is lagging. During the beta test of AO this was a constant event for players but now its a rare occurence for people.

I don't buy that myself.

RK1 - 5000 players peak (est) * 4K max bandwith per client = 20,000 KBPS
RK2 - 2000 players peak (est) * 4K max bandwith per client = 8,000 KBPS
RK3 - 500 players peak  (est) * 4K max bandwith per client = 2,000 KBPS

30,000 KBPS * 2 (surge) * 1.2 built in expansion load = 72,000 KBPS required to run this game.

That's barely an OC-3 worthy requirement.  Hell, we got military bases serving 2000 people with 2 T-1s these days using local print servers.

Evilspork @ 5/31/2002 4:11:18 AM (27739):
Like Ranor said, this is lag (when it 'catches up') or you disconnecting (when you, well, disconnect). If you had put two seconds of thought into it you could have figured this out on your own. Doesn't mean it shouldn't happen though. 

What I want to know more than this: why is a freaking GAME making my DSL die? I stopped playing for a couple weeks after the GA nerf, and during that time my connection was rock solid. Before that and now that I've started playing again my net connection will go down completely three or four times a night. This affects everything else my computer is doing. This affects everyone else in my home trying to do anything on the internet. This has been going on for months now, maybe even since launch. WHY is it still happening?

5th pick i got fine

Perhaps the mission cleanup is affecting it, but with this character, it was not only the first missions of the day but also the first missions this character had ever gotten.

Kabral @ 5/31/2002 4:55:48 PM (27165):
The location the Item you are looking for has been more randomized, tho it still tends to be near a corner of the dungeon.

Occasionally I find that I cant find the item, when this happens I leave the mission and renter it with a fresh map. I  pause in every room as I go and do a 360 to look for the item. In cave missions where you have a large room with water, you have to be careful as the item is often in the water.
On one occasion I just couldnt find the item, there was a large room with ramps going up several levels on one wall. On the off chance it was there I decided to go up an check and sure enough it was there.

Omni.

And now that I think of it, it was probably 3 craters.

And I still have Borealis map, and it works, odd that works for me but not for other person.

And if youre gonna ask which newbie map set installed I dont remember, except that I dont have a map to Wailing wastes so I'm assuming I didnt start out clan. Probably neutral.

Kabral @ 5/31/2002 5:41:22 PM (27595):
Kzip,

Sorry nope, these announcements about an upcoming downtime are system wide, doesnt matter where you are in the game you get them.

I and my team were 1/2 way through a mission when, bam, crash to desktop and unable to log back in. few minutes later the server status was changed to show the worlds were down for an Emergency fix.
After the worlds came back up, we logged back on to certain death 

There were no ingame warnings of this downtime, nor was there a warning on the login screen.

I talked to a GM about it and he said there was a miscommunication that allowed the worlds to be brought down without warning and he was very sorry that this happened. So I think you are talking about the Wednesday announced downtime rather than the Emergency fix that happened Thursday morning with no warning.

With the MP creation Viper Staff that does poison damage and poison DoT, if the poison kills the target no exp is given to the wielder. I dont believe this is the case with the DoT nanos cast by professions.

Fistgoddess @ 5/31/2002 10:04:55 PM (23486):
I have noticed the same thing, but the mobs attacking me have all been Agents.  I just chalked it up to the change in the concealment skill.  I.E.. Concealment vs. Perception= invisiblity if Concealment wins.  Just thought they were testing it on the mobs before putting it into 14.2 player patch, kinda like team mob aggro in single missions.

Ditka @ 5/31/2002 10:09:44 PM (26055):
Don't beat me with it, lend it to Cosmik.

Personally, I look at this as thier last chance to save my account.

Fistgoddess @ 5/31/2002 10:15:55 PM (25753):
I don't know if it was the bank gnomes or not but, I had a 3% xp ring come up missing from my bank.  I had an auction going on RK-1 Exchange and got an in game tell for 6mill.  I thought maybe I could close the auction early because the bids probably weren't gonna get any better than that.  When I went to get it out of my bank, it was gone.  None of my bags had it in there.  I had just seen it a few days prior, and thought should I equip or not.  I instead had to cancel the auction and sell the nice lady a 2% ring because that was the only one I had left.  Would it do any good for me to petition for this?

You cant use lockpicks that are in backpacks.   It doesnt say you fail, you just go through the animation and nothing happens.

I think the game considers most actions from a pack as a trade.It works sometimes and it don't work sometimes.Not surprising though.

Xeni @ 6/1/2002 7:33:58 PM ("poof" crystal removed from inventory, sorry NF already uploaded 28008):
If you already have a nano uploaded and try to upload the nano again, the test to see if you have the nano already, is done after the crystal is removed from inventory.

This have been around for too long now. It really need to be fixed, as the current system for organizing nanos dont support agents with 100+ nanos uploaded. Its maybe a problem for NTs and Docs too. who have alot of NF, but still easier for them i guess.

I've wasted maybe 10 crystal this way. Not big deal as most of those are lower QL shops nanos, but also lost some QL125. In credits these losses sums up to maybe a 4 mill.

FC, is it that much hassle to put the 'already uploaded' test before crystal is removed from inventory?

Dawndeath @ 6/2/2002 1:33:55 PM (My money lost... 28076):
Hello everyone.

I wanna report a big problem that made me very very unhappy about this game on which I have spent so much time for the last two months.

Today I sold two soul fragments to Ouchhh level 191 enforcer of The Council (sorry for mentionning your name but I have to if I want people to believe me). So, I sold them for 3.75 millions both, and 15 minutes later a lot of people got disconnected, and I was among them. When I came back, those 3.75M were gone... yes they were gone... that money I earned by hard work was gone, and I spent so much time to get it and by myself a yalm. And even before I could buy a yalm it disappeared. 

Of course I sent a petittion and a GM answered. His name was Kharoon. Well I asked him what he could do, and he replied that he couldnt do anything except send a bug report..... JUST A BUG REPORT? and what about my money! he said Funcom couldn't replace my money so I asked what about the time i wasted etc...? he told me I had to accept it. Come on I know I am not the only one to whom it happens, but all you people that happened too, do something about it, Funcom cannot just eat our time like this! We are paying to play, we are spending our time on that game and that's how we are rewarded. I couldn't even have tasted the joy of having that money I just got for 15 minutes! 

Now I want to know if you ARK's really cannot do anything about it? I can assure you what I am saying is true, you can check in your server files or I dunno how but what I am telling is completely true. I think it would be a shame if I had to cancel my account after all the time I spent on the game, and all the happy moments I had with it, but what happened today just made me so mad, and made me hate this game. Do something about it dear ARK's, do something and you people just cannot let this happen AGAIN! I am sure it is like the 100000000th time.

I said all I wanted to.
Bye.

PS : All the GM's that gave back the money got fired by Funcom in the past. I justs ent another peition and I am finally going to cancel my account. I know most of the people don't care but I think it will be a first step to show my deception.

kyrsan @ 6/2/2002 7:03:53 PM (Critical Hits 28098):
Someone forgot what a critical hit really is, methinks.  A critical hit is a hit which lands in such a place to cause the most amount of pain/damage in the shortest period of time.  On someone who is standing there and waiting for such, getting such a hit isn't that much of a problem.  For somoene swinging back with as much intent to cause as much harm makes getting a critical hit much harder because you are trying to defend against them as much as you are trying to get them.

I'm tried of fighting monters/NPCs who have the capacity of getting 5, 6, 7, 8, etc critical hits in a row.  I'm tried of fighting things which hit normally less often than they get a critical.  The most noticable things are the enforcer NPCs.  An equal level enforcer mob will easily get this many criticals in a row.  There is no reason for an equal level mob to get critical hits more often than regular hits.  Something needs to be seriously reworked when NPCs or monsters hit 60% of the time critically.

DaveDread @ 6/2/2002 7:14:09 PM (28098):
Have you raised your evades?

darkthought @ 6/2/2002 9:27:38 PM (Yet another Mez/Calm Bug 28112):
Righto, i've noticed this for a while, and not sure if anybody posted on this before, but here it goes...

There's a small problem with mob breaking the calm that you just cast on them. Example:

Fighting atrox enforcer mobs in mission. First thing I did was drop a calm through the doorway so I have time to fling a rather large and painful nuke on it...
Actually 2 bugs... calm lands, mob charges me when it should stand there doing nothing, hits me once then goes "idle." Luckily I'm used to this and managed to stop my gun from firing. Anyways, was moving finger to the cast button, and the Atrox casts one of the Challenger to Big_Mofo nanos. He get's big, and calm has broke.

I'm like, WTF? I walk out of the room, and back in to see if it really broke and not just the graphic, yep, he aggroed.

And Enforcers aren't the only ones that do this... just the only one I've verified. I'm pretty sure that Traders do, and Metas do too. This bug has killed me on no less than 4 occasions, latest was last night.

PLEASE FIX this bug, or change the discription of the calm to match the actual effects. 
And I quote the description of Project Calm, "If successful, the target will not enter combat unless it is attacked first."

I didn't attack. It buffed. Broken nano. And same with the mob charging you thing. That's broken too. Fix please. Thanks.


-Darkthought

Sheffy @ 6/2/2002 9:31:16 PM (23486):
For what its worth, the "larger" dungeon near the Mort OP is a prime place to find the main mission bugs.  I ran through it with a team 3 times yesterday, the same place experiencing a couple bugs each time.

1)  Invisible mobs.  The puller is attacking, but nobody else can target it.  Luckily, pets are AI, so pets will also attack it, even though nobody else can.  I didn't try targetting the puller and doing /assist since I was the doc and chain-healing since the battle was a long one since nobody else could attack it.  This is not one particular type of mob -- it seems to be any mob, seen it happen many times in many different missions too.  (Please note I don't think the mob is necessarily "invisible", yet possibly all the players' clients sense the mob in a different room (??) while it attacks them through walls or something..?)  After the mob is killed, the body will fall to the floor in the same room as the team, however, and is able to be looted.  So maybe it *is* invisible?  Or it just warps to the players after its dead?  Not sure.

2)  Players becoming out-of-sync on my screen.  I can see them in my team window, so I know they're somewhere near me.  I target them and do /follow.  I start running into a wall.  The person I have targetted says "I'm right behind you!"  This of course means I couldn't heal him while his health is going down because of Line of Sight, and my client thinking he was in another room.  Of course, my client is out of sync, so I have to go zone out of the dungeon and come back, and it fixes it.  (Leaving their view distance also helps)

3)  Puller goes to pull a mob.  The rest of the team sits around chatting while waiting for the puller to return.  "You received 12832 xp" pops up on our screens.  We ask where the puller is.  He says "Right next to all of you."  Nobody in the team saw the puller, OR the mob, *OR* the text of the hits during the fight.  This was especially annoying because I had no idea he was close to dying and I couldn't target him to heal him (as he was showing up as black in my team window).  Luckily he was a soldier and used his MK shield to survive and kill the mob.  We were in the opening room of the mission.  Having the puller zone out and back in fixed the problem.

These are 3 *VERY* big bugs, and have existed for quite some time.  I'm not sure what more details I can provide.  But, I can assure you I'm not making this up, as everyone on this board can probably verify, and has experienced, all 3 of the above.

Hopefully to be looked at and/or fixed very soon.

--Tsk

Sheffy @ 6/2/2002 9:34:39 PM (28008):
BUMP.  I've always hated losing a Nanocrystal by accidentally uploading it if I already learned the nano previously.  Just never said anything about it.

--Tsk

Neuronaut @ 6/2/2002 10:26:14 PM (28098):
The fact that mobs get crit hits like 80% of the time seems to just be a bug, if you ask me.  It specifically seems to have to do with Egnineers (though it could be all pet-using classes).  If I play any profession with or without evade skills raised I get hit normally with the occaisional crit hit.  But if I play my engi, I get hit with crit hits like 80% of the time, maybe more, even with mobs that are several levels lower.

So to stay alive at all around level 48, I have to ensure that my pet tanks completely.  In missions, this means that I have to send my pet ahead in to the next room and just sit in the previous room until the mob has no more than 25% of it's life left.  However, this doesn't always work, since the mobs often are in places where I can't target them to tell my pet to attack.  So I end up taking the brunt of the damage (since even though my pet dishes out at least twice as much damage as myself, it doesn't get the agro very often).  It doesn't matter how high-level my pet is, I can't seem to stay alive much 

If funcom would fix the crit-hit bug, this would alieviate this problem.  However, if this isn't considered a bug, and they don't fix it, I need some suggestions for when I do solo missions on how to stay alive.  Anyone have any?

Neuronaut @ 6/2/2002 10:32:25 PM (27165):
The only missions I do with my characters are the item finding missions (because you get an extra item to sell), and I haven't once found a mission with a missing item.  They are always there.  Though I will admit they are sometimes hard to find since they can be small, in a corner, in a dark room and so on.  Once I even found the item hidden under a large box (this was in a brown-cave style mission).

So look carefully, you'll find what you're looking for

DaveDread @ 6/3/2002 12:41:47 AM (28098):
* Raise your evades.
* Go more def on the agg/def bar.

Only mob that crits me is an MA mob, or someone buffed by an MA mob.

On full agg, you have basically 0 evades. That is why they crit, in my humble opinion. Try it out. If you find it wrong, you have an IP-reset coming up.

Dominata @ 6/3/2002 10:22:11 AM (28112):
This happens to me too. I cast "Discourage Involvement" on a mob and get the succesful message and I see the glow aorund the mob, too. Problem is, when the last graphical effect of the NF is done (the expanding blue bubble thingy) the glow disappears and the mob is only "halfway" calmed. 
In missions when we get adds I sometimes have to recast up to 4 or 5 times before it sticks properly. 
I use a Soft Pepper pistol, but my aggro is set to just below the 50% mark so I don't auto attack. This never used to happen before.

I accidently casted nano net on my self and after that i couldn't remove the program. kinda stupid since i casted it on my self. dunno if this is a bug or if it's supose to be that way though.

biggfoo @ 6/3/2002 1:36:05 PM (28190):
It's a hostile nano so you can't cancel it though any legit means.

You could just cast a debuff on yourself and it will cancel the root/snare

Kwerk @ 6/3/2002 2:53:51 PM (23486):
Attention Cosmik,

The description provided by Bionitrous is perfectly accurate.

It happens to me daily during solo missions against red mobs.

It's always a close fight so I rush it, attack, brawl and cast Blessed with Thunder (MA Dot)

Then I run back to the entrance area to use a first aid kit, let my brawl recharge, and let the dot work.  

If i outrun the mob, it becomes invisible, attacks me and I can't attack back.  The on-screen information is exactly what Bionitrous describes.

If I zone out and return the mob is waiting and I can re-engaged sucessfully.

Persepine @ 6/3/2002 3:48:46 PM (Monster map upgrade stopped working 28217):
I recently got the map upgrade "monsters"
i went on 2 missions and it was working great and i could see all the hostiles as red dots in the mission map.
Then all of a sudden on my next mission it stopped showing any red dots and still does not work,My map navigation is higher than the requirement and it still says i have the upgrade when i get info on myself. Anyone ever have this happen to them?
I petitioned and they cant figure it out either.

I tried emailing support like they told me to in game, but all the emails are bouncing back to me.

Pluteaux @ 6/3/2002 4:31:41 PM (23486):
This started happening to me much more frequently when I started rooting and running much more frequently. The work around, for me, at least, seems to be to not run so far that I can no longer see the dot representing the mob on my map. Then I can use F1 to toggle between targetting me and targetting him. If I do run so far that I can no longer see the dot, and then wait, usually, I'll get a message "Attacked by None" when the mob starts coming after me. Actually a useful message in this circumstance since now I know he's coming. When he does arrive at my location, he may or may not be invisible. If he's invisible, he can attack me, but I cannot attack him, since I can't target him. F1 doesn't target him.

This has also happened to me a few times when I got "teleported." Once, I was running toward the exit, arrived in the first room, and got teleported back a few rooms. The doors were black, and I couldn't run through them. The mob could shoot me, apparently, er, not so apparently, from rooms away no matter where in the room I stood. I was automatically shooting back at him, but he killed me.

Another time, I was fleeing a mob or two and  got teleported back to the first room. Great, I thought, now I can exit. I got the "Changing area, please wait" message, the screen froze as I waited to show up outside the mission. And the mobs arrived and killed me while I was waiting.

Finally, if I'm waiting in the first room, an invisible mob starts to hit me, and I exit and come back in, I can see the mob.

Pluteaux @ 6/3/2002 4:56:49 PM (27855):
On two occasions, after killing the last mob in the mission, I got a message saying my chances for a token were 92%. I picked up the item to complete the mission, but didn't get a token. There are two types of situations that can lead to not getting credit for killing a mob. First, my pet is fighting a mob that is attacking me, so I exit the mission and come back in. The pet apparently killed the mob since he is gone. Second, I'm at the entrance fighting a mob, and we're both almost dead, so I exit. But, as I'm going through the door, I fire one last shot which kills the mob. I hear him make the dying sound and see him fall to the ground as I exit. In both situations, when I reenter the mission, there is no body to get loot and/or credits for looting. You get no xp. You get no increase in your chance for a token.

Isn't available on vendors.  Its icon is a ? and its supposed to be sellable (its a very low level nano, something a level 10 might be able to cast).  

Also the Sloth series doesnt seem to do anything.  I cast lesser enforced sloth on myself and a monster and other then the physical graphic effect, nothing happend.   Even the descriptiion doesnt tell you what it is used for.   It just says greatly slows a target so much that it almost cant move.    Unlike others, such as the Red tape line, it doesnt say anything like (Run Speed -XXX).

Deep @ 6/3/2002 6:34:40 PM (28112):
Yea, mezzed mobs run up to thier last target and stand there.  Its very annoying if 4 monsters run up to the tank and 3 of them are mezzed.  Its hard to pick out the right one and sometimes people get confused and attack mezzed mobs.

They should just stop where they are or go back to thier normal spot.

Bionitrous @ 6/3/2002 6:36:33 PM (28246):
Don't even waste yer money on Snares until you can use one that has about a -500 runspeed modifier.  Before that, they just waste your credits and crowd up your nanopanels.

After that, the Snare is probably more useful than the root.  By the time you get to a Snare that offers a -900'ish Runspeed modifier, you've got a nice nano that effectively 'roots' the monster AND won't break until the victim has been hit at least 3 times.

Taldrin @ 6/3/2002 7:11:21 PM (Mission respawns STILL not fixed?!? 28250):
Our team was working through a mission today in BS (as usual). This particular mission was enormous. At around 70% complete the server decided to kick everyone in our team from the game and respawn the mission. Hence we all logged back in and died. We lost experience ranging from 3mill up to 5.2mill, all gained in that mission. Why is this still happening?! Get it fixed ffs!

Scorus @ 6/3/2002 7:52:05 PM (28112):
Soldier mobs casting mirror shield also break their own mez. Any friendly nano that also casts a hostile nano on them (such as the shutting down of nano capabilities from Challenger or Mirror Shield) registers as an attack and breaks the mez. Much like players can break roots and such by self-casting hostile nanos. Fun, huh?

Yes Rotamus, Mongo breaks calms. Being level 139 I managed to pick that up somewhere along the way, pity not all Enforcers have... 

I am talking about mobs who isn't buffing themselves at all, in solo missions. Will make a note tonight or tomorrow if I see any consisitency of mobs who are able to shrug my calms off.

Ditka @ 6/4/2002 4:18:35 AM (26055):
It just happened again to the tune of 1.48 mil.

Why am I playing this game?

Ohh ya, because SWG isn't out yet.

Cosmik:  can you at LEAST get my name changed to Whycan't "Chown" Save

I know you WON'T refund the xp.
I know you can't make anyone in the ark program give a damn.
I know you can't convince the people in game direction that they're quickly ruining what was once the BEST MMPORG.

But can you at least do that?

Come on, grant me a pyrrhic victory.

Bonefish @ 6/4/2002 11:28:44 AM (Omni Grey Suit Shirt  (male version) 28371):
My org established itself in early September last year, and we quickly decided to be a be a little different and adopt the "Omni Grey Suit" uniform as our org uniform. We are a very heavily RP based OT org, so things like a uniform are very important to us. 

Therefore, we immediately acquired all the "Omni Grey Suit" boots, pants, skirts, sleeves, and female shirts we needed. No problem there. 

However... to this day, some 10 months later we've still not seen one single "Omni Grey Suit Shirt", i.e. the male suit shirt, in any shop we've ever visited. 

I know the "Omni Grey Suit Shirt" exists as I see it worn by LOTS of OT NPCs walking around, and found it in item databases on the web such as antiguardians etc. 

Why is the female one available freely, yet the male one is missing/not available? Sexism? 

I think it is probably just a bug that prevents the shirt from appearing in the shops. Can you look into it? 

I've sent several emails to support over this past year, and have asked ARKs about 5-6 times now, each time I get a different answer why it is not available, each time it sounds like they're guessing or fabricating an answer impulsively. 

Please help us poor RPers enjoy the game a bit more? Surely it can't be difficult nor time consuming to fix?

Please fix/enable the "Omni Grey Suit Shirt"?

Equality for male shirt wearers!!

Happened to me too.  turned out I was the only one that could hit the boss.  So, everyone else killed the adds while I bashed away at the boss.  Then they took up seats, got some popcorn and sat and watched me finish off the boss.  Took forever, and secretly I think they were laughing at me hehe.

Thank God I had a healer keeping me healthy.

Cranium @ 6/4/2002 2:53:02 PM (4164):
>>what FunCom is doing to fix the camping issues<<
We've had long discussions on this issue and one of our network gurus has written up a pretty clever design on it. The issue is scheduled to be reconsidered for 14.6. I'm crossing my fingers into knots that the system works as planned, but there's A LOT of factors to consider when filtering players into static dungeon instances.

>>Almost every post that Cranium makes is worth about a thousand Cosmik and Cz posts put together.<<
That's not very fair to Cosmik and Cz, they've done way more for the community than I. They basically _have_ to respond to threads whether they are able to gather the neccessary info or not, to show that issues are being registered by FC. I get to pick & choose posts that happen to correlate with what I know is going on with AO, like this post that was collecting dust in the attic. If I worked in community there'd be a helluvalot of loose threads on my track record as well.

>>I love the idea of having the Subways be static adventuring areas for low level characters.<<
Good! 

>>If it hasn't been already envisioned, I would suggest interlinking all these various Subways into a supersystem. <<
That's close to the original vision, which unfortunately made it into the printed manual but not into the game. Basically, the Whom-Pah proved a more resource-friendly solution to the core functionality we needed (city-to-city travel).

>>the merger area of the Clan and Omni sections of these interlinked 'dungeons' should be 25% or 0% gas<<
I love the idea of connecting PvP tunnels, but linking instanced dungeons (static or not) used to be nigh-on impossible. Still looks very unlikely to happen but we're looking at ways to just maybe cheat fate on this one... 

Miracles or not, there will be a static location for each start-up city where lowbies can play. 'Condemned Subway' (architecture is complete, waiting for monsters, loot & testing) is currently planned for 14.6, but no promises.

This is whats happening:

The Newland and Mort maps are very upset about not being the only maps found in chests anymore.  So they are on strike.  The only problem is that most people dont have the map nav to upload the Mort map, so, unfortunately poor Map of Mort isnt being heard as well as Map of Newland.

Poor Map of Mort, I feel bad for it.

Sorry, poor humor.

Some bosses is invulnerable to certain type of damage.
Myself using alsaqri/gluegun combo, which both are chemical dmg, often meets bosses taking no dmg from chemical weapons. Therefore i keep a a disaflation sniper in backup, which do projectile dmg, and have always worked so far when my alsaqri and gluedun fails.

Bionitrous @ 6/4/2002 3:25:27 PM (4164):
Really appreciate the efforts your putting forth with respect to these particular issues.  My jadedness with mission after mission is starting show through in particularly dark colors these days.

As far as interconnecting the 'lowbie' Subway tunnels, I fully appreciate what you're saying with regard to linking multi-instantiated playfields.  I am guessing that the 'cheating' you are talking about involves 'hubs' that are single instance with exits to the tunnel systems that would eventually end up in Borealis or Newland.  You would enter the Subway in the Eastern part of Newland and work your way through all kinds of newbie dungeon delight.  

At the end you could turn around and head home or perhaps climb over a pipe and end up in some water-filled murky Train Switching Station that would actually be a single instance playfield.  This could be devoid of most native wildlife to conserve resources and rely on player 'interaction' and atmosphere to set the tone.  Through further exploration your party might find additional tunnels that have outlets in other parts of the world.  These could then be the multi-instantiated 'lowbie' dungeons of the the other cities.

However, none of this is as interesting as the slipped tidbit about what may or may not occur in 14.6.  Basically, my entire guild is fading away from lack of anything that we can say we are going to do on 'Tuesday' where we can all sign on on Tuesday and have a start, middle, and end to our adventures.

A romp in Smuggler's Den is spoiled by 'trainers', super high level players, groups who have the technicians spawn mapped and timed to the second, 'egg pharmers', well you get the idea.  It is completely and utterly impossible for us to say to our gang that "'Tuesday' is going to be a blast.  Bring your bug zappers and prepare for some fun."  The way things are set up now, it is an almost certainty that it will be the exact opposite of what is fun.

Not now.  Not this week (you're going to have the fallout of 14.2).  But soon.  Soon, you are absolutely going to have to address the fact that for a majority of your players who are completely able to handle the static dungeons, they simply don't exist in all practicality.  I can probably save my guild if I could give them a timeframe.  I could beg them not to cancel and even send out emails to get people to come back if I could say to them that 'July 18th or so, we'll be able to group together as brothers once again and kill that Mantis b*****."

We, the 'non-entitled' need to be able to log on and say to each other 'what do you want to do today?' and be able to choose from a half-dozen REAL options.  'Let's do Smugglers', 'Lets give that new Dragon a shot', 'How about them do-hickeys in DAV?', etc., etc., all with understood risks, rewards, and a reasonable chance of achieving 'completion' and that ever-less-frequent smile at logoff time.

Thanks for listening.

Pluteaux @ 6/4/2002 6:04:27 PM (28250):
This happened to me once yesterday and once today. Both times my bot and I were about 2/3 through the mission. Both times I was in a room with only me and my bot. Both times "we" had killed all my mobs between the entrance and where we were, deep into the mission. After the client crashed, and I relogged, my bot was gone, I was in a room with a mob, and there was at least one mob in every room between me and the exit. I couldn't kill even one of the mobs alone. Both times I died, losing over a level of xp between the 2 deaths.

I'm glad to have found a thread with the sort of probs I've been having.

Missions going poof? No rhyme or reason that I can see, whether returning for more after a session, or first thing when I log on. I click accept..........the game says lalalala.........

Now if I'm just doing missions for points/money in areas I can get to, fine. I can roll another. But when I've spent X amount of time camping, to get that item I really want.....and it turns up in a mission.........and I accept.......and it vanishes......

Well, go figure what my reaction is. Just buy some earplugs if you're anywhere near Avalon mission terminals.

This bug was /petitioned by a fellow Guild member back in March, and the response was "hmm, not heard of it, o well"

Thats like saying FIX Solitus! nothing wrong.

I see atrox enforcesr do a pretty good job already, why make it worse or why make it better?

Mysticknight @ 6/5/2002 1:34:17 PM (23897):
atrox enforcers doing a good job?
ive seen plenty of docs die cause the nano challenged atrox enforcer couldnt draw enough agro after 5 or 6 mongos to keep him alive
what good is having a ton of HP if you cant keep the agro

the new fire riders that advents get will out damage beams hammers and the old riders untill you get high enough init to overcome the speed difference

being atrox you are penalized with lower nano and lower nano skills
to make up for that you should be doing more physical damage and taking more damage as well.
as it stand,after this patch you will not have either of those.

Of these I would say that Nanos have the strongest argument. They give up 800 raw hps at level 200 for 200 raw nano pool. (Compared to Solitus.) I will argue until the end of time that Solitus is a better breed than Nano even for "caster" classes. Sure, health might seem pretty unimportant to a doc. He gets good hp buffs after all. Well, those buff a solitus just as much as a nano breed. And 800 hps will mean the difference between the aggro being pulled off the doc and a dead doc many a time.

But I know my Atrox would happily give up 200 pool at 200 for 800 more health. Every day of the week.

Sorry if I sound pissed, but I am.. you spend 4 hours doing various patches over and then have'em corrupted..it's not fun.

RedSonja @ 6/5/2002 6:55:37 PM (For gods sake - Shops still fubar!!! 28801):
Right, this is getting a little bit silly now.
These issues have been posted time and time again yet we have no official answer and we certainly are not seeing any kind of fix appearing.
With every patch I for one hope this issue will be solved, but no, yet again it still has not been fixed.

Shops are STILL NOT correctly spawning items.
I have just done a run around to every Superior Store that I know about and none of them contain a single piece of Graft armour.
A few patches ago the shops were broken, the ONLY graft items that spawned were Boots, Helmet & Pants making the graft chest an extremely rare item, considering it never spawns in mission chests and I don't ahve a spare hour to keep on re-rolling missions until I'm offered one.
I do not know the status on other armour types as it is only Graft that my two enforcer characters are interest in.

This issue has been reported time and time again and you've now managed to take a step BACK with the 14.2 patch.
How difficult can this be????

Luciana @ 6/6/2002 2:12:30 AM (MCS uses Melee Init? MY TESTS SHOW YES! IT DOES! 28930):
Ok after the reset i did some experiments with the speed of the MCS.  I will walk you though my expirience...

First i Reset IP. and reallocated most of my skills, all but ranged init.

PART 1 - THE MCS WITH LOW RANGED INIT
IN THEORY:
The MCS with an attack time of 3sec/1sec should do damage every 4 seconds when havign an extreemy low ranged init.  every 4 seconds means 15 attacks per minute.

IN PRACTICE:
At a really low ranged init (30 skill) the MCS performed as expected, giving me almost exacty 15 shots per minute.

PART 2 - THE MCS WITH HIGH RANGED INIT
IN THEORY:
The MCS should attack way more than 15 times per second, i do not have the knowlage of exactly how to calculate how many times it should attack, but it sohuld be more than 15.

IN PRACTICE:
The MCS did somthing odd...It gave me EXACTLY 15 shots per minute still. Keep in mind this 15 shots per minute is an average of about 10 trials. This 15 shots per minute is AFTER raising my Ranged Init from 30 to 353.  Think there should be some kind of change at all?

PART 3 - THE SOL CHIRONIS WITH LOW RANGED INIT
IN THEORY:
The SC has an attack time of 1.5sec/1.5sec, therefore it should yeild 1 shot every 3 seconds with low ranged init.  So my calculations state that it should attack 20 times in one minute

IN PRACTICE:
The SC performed as calculated, yeilding 20 shots (on average) every minute. No surprise here.

PART 4 - THE SOL CHIRONIS WITH HIGH RANGED INIT
IN THEORY:
This is where it gets interresting. The SC, when i rasied my Ranged init from 30 to 353 should be extreemly fast.

IN PRACTICE:
The SC gave me a blistering 30 shots per minute! I could barely keep up with it when i was tallying the number of shots!

PART 5 - CONCLUSION
So, it turns out that the MCS, no matter what ranged init i had, produced the same average number of attacks per minute.  The sol chironis however, increased its speed by 33%! I think that this CLEARLY shows that the MCS is STILL USING MELEE INIT.

This must be changed immediately! This is !!NOT!! somthing that can wait for the fixer patch in 14.4, or was it 18.9? I will post this just about EVERYWHERE I CAN.  FUNCOM MUST FIX THIS!

Takhai @ 6/6/2002 3:52:02 AM (28789):
Ya, I fixed it..took me 5 hours.

baradox @ 6/6/2002 6:37:16 AM (Boss had no LOOT! 28985):
Just spend 2 hours , going thro a QL 87 mission , made it to the boss at 93 % complete, just me and a lower lvl MA , we took awhile but we killed it, and we had team loot alpha on, and i was the one to loot it, and he had nothing but 869 credits !!!!! can you say GRRRRRRRRRRR. Dunno if anyone else out there has had this problem , but i hope its not gonna repeat, and i hope its a bug !

Anyways , a response would be nice , cause 2 hour missions without any boss loot , just dont seem worth it. Thats my opinion anyways heh.

Snee @ 6/6/2002 9:43:57 AM (23897):
Bump!

Im a 152 Atrox Trader now.

Little did I know that I would have 1000 less max nano at lvl 200. That is about 4 Premium Delayed Health Payments (4000 Health). Thats a lot when it comes to large scale PvP and you get those "Cannot perform this action while in a fight".

Why should Solitus get a 1000 more max nano when they are the basis of all breeds? In my mind they should receive 0 max health and 0 max nano. Every other breed should get modifiers on the basis of its abilities in terms of Solitus abilities. Im not sure Opifex comes out of this any good, so maybe Runspeed should be given a breed bonus too.

The best would be to not give breed bonuses at all, but actually let the abilities set the max modifiers. Just give out more than 3 points for every 12 points raised in the appropriate ability when it comes to Nano Pool, Max Health and again maybe Runspeed.

Pomfrey @ 6/6/2002 10:06:41 AM (28801):

No, really.

well, ok she didn't but she did say there wasn't a problem with shops and it was to encourage you to visit other places.

WHY THE ARK TALKS ****:

1. it only spawns one or two pieces from each armor set, when was the last time you saw omni-pol in the shops other than gloves? or flowers other than gloves and boots?

2. what the hell happened to getting it all at omni1 trade? this is a city dedicated to commerce set up by an arms manufacturer... you'd think i'd be able to pick up a friggin' suit of armor.

*There have been added a line of sight checks to MOBs' perception check in mission dungeons. This means a lower chance of being detected by MOBs in other rooms when sneaking in missions. Aimed shot should therefore work better now.

-----------------------------

Just did a level 129 mission, had the brown cave with the fireplace in the main hall. This is what happened ...

I entered the mission and while still standing at the entranceway where I had zoned, 3 Rebooters from inside the main hall went aggro on me.  They were green, so no problem, I dispatched all 3 at the entranceway itself. 

I start to move slowly towards the doorway of the main hall and just as I reach the door, a Programmethief came rushing at me from OUT of the left wall ( ... the stretch of wall aligned with the fireplace ... the one that has a long corridor behind it leading to at least 3 rooms).  

So yes, this NPC came from one of the rooms, crossed the corridor and came through that fireplace wall and into the main hall. So where is this new Line of Sight for the mobs working in this situation??

Krneki @ 6/6/2002 2:35:43 PM (Wrong ability requirement on Lokas Web Cloak 29088):
ok facts first:

QL 1 Lokas Web Cloak  has psy/int requirements.
QL 200 Lokas Web Cloak  has psy/sta requirements.

Weird huh. Well lets say it's Antiguardian's Fault (yea that's it )!

The problem is a psy/sta cloak already exists and it's called Marcus Divaad Web Cloak  Both QL 1 and 200 have psy/sta requirements.

Further more, the description of cloaks supports the fact that Lokas Web Cloak should be psy/int. Let me elaborate:

Mathis Web Cloak - The constant pressure from the counter-wave requires the user to be both fit and have some physical balance. ; that's why it has sta/str reqs.

Ion Web Cloak - It is totally silent, but requires some physical balance to use. ; that's why it has agi/str reqs

Marcus Divaad Web Cloak - Also less physical balance is required, but instead you need far more power of concentration. ; that's why it has psy/sta reqs

Lokas Web Cloak - No physical skills are needed, but you will need some tactical skill and focus to control the thing. ; Guess what reqs it should have...


Would be nice if this catches the eye of a designer or someone from Funcom.

and in about 5 minutes my petition got bumped down 16 places, i do not bother to check again.

to say i am pissed is an understatement.

here is what happened:
i tried to save and got told that i have an item in the reclaim.

i check and find a blue question mark item (you nkow the funny no name things that have been around since launch? exactly that) in the reclaim.

so i click on it to take it out. close the reclaim and poof here it is again.

i petition only to find out that i get repeatedly bumped down the row. i understand that emergency situations require fast service but wtf is that?

my guess is that the bug is a known issue and beyond arg power or some funny stuff like that but it would not hurt to send me a line or two.

getting bumped down repeatedly while not being able to do anything with my main character is not my idea of a good time in ao.

*edit:
i can take a joke.

really usually i can.

but a clan mate send a petition just for fun and we discovered that my petition is repeatedly bumped to the LAST slot.

thank you funcom.*

to elaborate i could pick up (not delete) said item after a guardian showed up.

i could not do that before - it was not a problem of latency since i tried it in avalon and after killing myself foolishly hoping this would clean up reclaim in home.

now it worked.

Quindillar @ 6/7/2002 2:14:27 AM (Graphical bug with battle suit affecting yalm 29305):
I did a battlesuit mission today, just to see what it was worth to shopiing term. For fun i decided to equipp it and i went perfect, until i zoned out of the shop. I was wearing my yalm, and it suddenly had the battlesuit texture on it. Looked really cool, but when i asked a few ppl, they said it looked normal to them. I took a few screenshots and unequipped my yalm. Guess what? now im naked. The battlesuit isn't showing on me, so i took a couple of screens of this too. Did u try to fix the battlesuit texture in 14.2.1/2? If so i think something went wrong.

But I gave the item back to Dodga (2 times waiting in line...) and did not get xp, no tokens, and no shoulderpad. Only the next quest... So been killing robots the last weeks for 0.

Seid @ 6/7/2002 4:32:19 PM (Recurring, very tiresome bug : Cannot log in 29454):
Usually occurs when switching chars or after crashing/lagging out.

You have to try a zillion times before the game completes loading after relogging...

Log in, wait, give up, kill process, rinse and repeat.

The process usually stops loading at 60MB, and after that, nothing. No CPU used, no network traffic...just dead client.

Waiting for the loggen on char to time out helps no better than to try loggin into the logged on char.

This can be very trying when relogging to help someone with an alternate char...

Neurobasher @ 6/8/2002 8:46:13 AM (28076):
A member of our org lost 15 mill too after Tir zone crashed a while ago. And of course petitioning didn't help at all. :-(

All I can recommend is to do big trades in shops as they are less likely to crash (other server than surrounding zone). And zone & save ASAP after the trade. It's annoying but less annoying than to loose valuable items or lots of cash.

Neurobasher @ 6/8/2002 8:49:27 AM (Reflection bracers 29621):
Not really a bug, but they reflect like 2-10 points (at least the QL versions I saw). That's a joke considering the mobs do like  100-150 damage on me. Should they reflect in % instead of fixed points to be usefull?

How many of you are scared to enter a bridge over water room in missions? I'd say 30% of the time I do, I suddenly take a gazillion fall damage and die. What's up with that.

DaveDread @ 6/8/2002 11:47:09 AM (28930):
okies... if ranged init works the same way as melee/phys init it goes like this:

600 init = -1 sec attack - 2 sec recharge.

For a MCS (3.0/1.0) to go full speed you'd need 1200 in ranged init on full agg.

Your 353 ranged init will make the MCS go appx. 2.5/1.0. It might be hard to see that difference, but I suspect it's there allright.

The Over-tuned E-Beamer recipie is also broken. The thing is that when I try to put the last component in it doesn't tell me anything. It doesn't even say the usuall stuff in green, it doesn't tell me anything. The worst is that this is one of the few guns that actually are good that you can make. According to the Antiguardians Weapon evaluator it does more damage then a Nova Flow over 30 sec (I doubt that though :/ )

So you could add this to the list of broken recipies

runey @ 6/8/2002 4:43:30 PM (Starting attack failed, mission entrance bouncing, floating mobs, etc. 29680):
Well, I tried petitioning with half this stuff, but I was no. 44 in queue, so might as well mention it here.

Starting attack failed - Died to this one twice yesterday. I didn't even get off a "heal!" before I kicked the bucket, having long since run out of nano and being nearly dead when we (thought we) killed the mob.

Mission entrance bouncing - Died to this one too. The mission in particular was the downed Omni-tek shuttle in Avalon almost due south from the Cyborg Billet. We zoned in, got two enforcers instead of one, try to zone out. Get outside for one second then, "Changing area". Back into the mission. Ten...freaking..times..in..a..row. By the tenth time, one of the mobs was gone, so we decided to fight it out. Would've won, except...the guy parried a dimach. How in the blue blazes do you parry a "soul attack"? My partner got the guy, then decided to log in the mission, since she couldn't get out.

Floating mobs - Certain mob types (seems to be these tall nanomage males of varying professions, including doctors and mps) float roughly a foot above the floor. Their drop shadow floats with them, so they look like they're flying around the mission on little hover discs. Not serious, just freaky.

Yalm equipping fun - Ever been turned into another critter by an adventurer (or are one)? The yalm remembers. Turn off the morph, exit mission, put on plane. No go, you're still "transformed" according to the yalm. And heaven help ya if you die while your yalm was equipped. It's now blacked out until you log, even if you've got the vehicle air to use it just fine.  It eventually will relent and let you equip it (still x'd out), but that takes a bit.

These and many other fun bugs, courtesy of the new patch. Since most of these bugs aren't new with this patch (they're reoccurring ones that just keep coming back for more), I put this here.

Saturday Bump.

Scrappy @ 6/8/2002 10:11:15 PM (29256):
I want to add a little clarification to  this issue.

The timing of special attacks (skill locking) has been an issue for awhile now.  It seemed to get better after 14.0 and an announced fix, but it is now almost as bad as ever.  

The symptom is this:  after using a special attack or skill, you wait for the notification message that the skill is again ready for use.  This message appears too soon (or the skill cycles too slow), and when you attempt to use the skill you get the "Please wait for previous..." message if it's a special attack or the "skill will be available in X seconds" if it's a non-combat skill.  The amount of lag time between the displayed 'skill available' message and the actual availability of the skill is proportional to the recharge time of the skill.  For example, if you see "Dimach is now available" you will have to wait several minutes until it can actually be used, whereas the lag for Flingshot is only a second or two.  I estimate that the lag time is 10-20% of the skill recharge time, and it happens to all special attacks and skills.  You can see it even with Treatment Kits, though the lag time on them is only a second or two.

An additional bug is present for special attacks.  If your special attack delivers the killing blow to an opponent, the skill icon does not gray out, it appears ready even though it is in the process of recycling.  In this case you may not get a notification message when is skill is supposed to ready again.

Neuronaut @ 6/9/2002 5:46:43 AM (29242):
Out of 3 team missions I've done recently, around level 60, I've only seen one boss mob drop anything good (and it wasn't really anything very special, either).  The first one dropped one monster part, the second one dropped nothing at all(!), and the third one dropped a few items that could all have been found on a regular mob.

This is really disappointing after we've been told they'd drop some nice loot.  All that work to kill them (and even a few deaths), with no reward at all.  Hopefully when I wake up tomorrow there'll be a 14.2.3 patch that fixes this (and the other bugs introduced recently).

Just remember to get an NT to give the Enf in the team a decent HE. I know most Enfs love having it for the ability to chain mongo. The NT also loves it as it helps to have someone pull a bit of aggro off them. And the docs love it as they are then 3rd down the aggro list   Just a bit of a prob if you don't have an NT handy, so remember to not leave home without one  (NT that is).

  Basically, from what is said here and how this situation is being handled, if you know the right people or if you have enough friends to make enough noise- they'll do something.

I have heard of a lot of people report incidents where they lost items or xp due to server crashes, zoning, mission reseting.  Never have I heard of anyone getting something back due to those incidents.  It may have happened, but I, personally, haven't heard of it.

Even with situations happening that follow the above requisites to a T, people still don't get any help.  

If you go read this full post in the thread about the hacked accounts (mechanics forum).  CZ says that that WAS NOT a situation where reimbursement was warrented.  Now, I'm glad Mantra and the other person got their items back.  I feel that that situation was handled properly.  But we all know it wasn't done because of poor customer relations.  It was done because there were 24,000+ views on that thread and a lot of high level people threatening to quit.  Basically, if you cause a big enough uproar, you will be heard.  Reguardless of policy.  And if you don't have the friends to back you by canceling their account, you won't get help.  Even if your situation falls exactly in the parameters mentioned in the quote above.

Hell, if we all had a problem taken care of becuase the customer support was poor, FC would owe us all something.

p.s.- again, I'm not saying that mantra shouldn't have got his items back- just that FC needs to treat people equally.  We all pay the same price to play this game.

rubberducky @ 6/9/2002 8:55:13 PM (4871):
Glad I found this thread so I could *bump* it.  I just posted in another area that the Long-Axe Hyper 200x Construction Kit is also broken. 

I realize that the mature population of this game that is interested in actually developing a non-mainstream character who's sole purpose isn't to be 'uber' or 'l33t' in combat is in the vast minority, so I don't expect to see a fix soon.  However, it was stated 5 months ago that something was going to be done, and it obviously hasn't.

I certainly haven't been on the boards much, but I have heard many people in the game express ambivalence towards Funcom customer support, and now I see why when they are basically lied to.

If you're not planning on fixing something, for goodness sake just say so - tell the truth.  Lying to us doesn't make anything better.

Sheffy @ 6/9/2002 11:56:05 PM (HUGE damage inflicted AFTER a fight -- PLEASE READ 29926):
Hi guys,

There has been a HUGE bug introduced in 14.2, similar to before when the mob would remain standing after he was killed and hit you one or two more times before falling over dead.

However, now I've been taking a LOT of damage WELL after the mob is already dead (and laying on the ground).

Here is one example of this.

edit - Here is another.

We had just killed the mob and I was sitting on the ground trying to use my treatment packs, though it said I was in a fight and I was unable to heal.  Please note that the damage messages do not indicate damage type, or what is hitting me.  This has happened many times since 14.2, sometimes inside missions, others outside like this one.  It's especially scary when it happens to team members in a mission while I'm the Doctor.  I've seen them be at 100% health one second, 5% the next, because of this very same issue.

I checked with other people in-game, as well as people on IRC, and other people have said they've experienced the same thing.  I'm hoping Funcom is aware of this and that they plan on fixing it, hopefully in the next patch (SOON), because it can be detrimental to a person if they were not at full health when the fight ended.

Quick side-note:  This happened to me when I was not even aggro'd the entire fight, so I don't believe it's "lag damage" like many of you are probably thinking.  I never got "Attacked by..." during the fight or afterwards.  Just started getting hit.

I've never actually been killed by this, but maybe I've just been very lucky?  This could really suck if there are adds which are still attacking you as well.

Funcom?  Please acknowledge this?    I'll email support@ and bugs@ as well, as per procedure.

--Tsk

Xeraseus @ 6/10/2002 12:39:37 AM (26055):
Even if your interpretation is correct, the gist of my argument is true.  

CZ went in that thread and said that he'd see what he could do.  Later on in that same thread he went in and said that THAT situation was not one that was reimbersable.  After that (and some before that post)  there was the flood of account cancelation threats and wala, they get their items back.

And going on the quote I posted, it could be interpreted as either my version or yours.  Neither can be proved to be exactly what was meant, its too vague.

OllieG2 @ 6/10/2002 6:14:46 AM (29926):
The event order lag is bad in general.

Since 14.2 I've seen various weird events happening out of sequence, but this has been going on for some time.  However, I agree that after the 14.2 patch install was the first time that I saw quite so much event order lag.  

I have had similar problems during 13.x (?) when I actually killed a beast, leveled, jumped for joy, and then got killed by it's dead body (?).  

I also see messages like: 
"You must wait 1 second" or even "You must wait 5 seconds" after I've just seen the chat window message that the skill is available.

I've seen someone I kill fall to the ground, then stand up again.  (Lucky he did fall back down so I could loot him.)

Typically my man stops fighting while the mob is still standing, but a hairs breath from death.  I can't start the attack back up.  The mob still delivers attacks, but I consider him dead.  Lucky for me the pet isn't fooled, so he finishes off the mob.

In fact it's always been weird that the pets will continue to strike something that's lying on the ground, dead.  That's always been the case, including the beta days.

I'm also finding that I can't get my special attacks to launch.  I click the icon for an MA attack and nothing is displayed telling me its not available, nor that it was resisted, yet I see no information about it's failure or success in the chat bar.  Sometimes I see a message that I need to wait until the last special attack has finished - "hellllooo..."

And the worst thing is when I can't hit someone and they're shooting me because I'm trying to fight a lag image of their position - "target out of range" and he's got a gun.  I have to run so that he moves, usually that forces everything to work correctly and I can actually see his real position.

So many things out of order, rarely do I  come out ahead because of them...

Other items that are not spawning is the Bird of Prey QL 51+ and Blessed with Thunder.

I been told to check the shops.  I have been to every Omni-aligned shop and neutral shop that I can think of since the 14.2 patch and neither of these attacks are anywhere. 

Also as for getting them in missions, at level 12 I was using my QL 50 BoP, since missions only offer rewards of the same QL, there is no way I am going to get a QL 100 or 150 (which I proablby could use considering I could triple the requirments and still use it) on a mission for a level 35 MA.

My speical MA attack has gone from a powerful primary damage dealer to a secondary almost worthless attack that does less damage most of the time then I do with a normal punch.

Funcom write: All armour / utilities / HUD items more than 20% over-equipped will have their AC stats / special stats reduced with 25%. If you are more than 40%, 60% or 80% over-equipped, the stat reduction will be (in order) 50%, 75% and 100%.


Now OE work on ours Scopes (old\new) or not? :-\

Or may be will work later? (after finished IPR patches)

Snee @ 6/10/2002 7:20:16 PM (Kevlar Armor as Mission Rewards 30125):
I tried this for a long time, and admit having used ClickSaver to try solve my frustration.

What Im looking for as a reward is some QL184 Kevlar Armor Pants which I will replace with my MK2 Pants (they look like crap with the new cloaks on). Fashion Freaks, go figure!

Ive tried to find some QL200 too, but no luck. All I can find is QL154 and 169, but only Kevlar Vests at those other QLs.

I dont think it should be this way, and I belive it to be a bug. This type of armor should be easy accesbile, but it aint.

Using 1 million credits on finding a Kevlar Armor (any of the 6 items) and still no luck.

So please put a Ql184 Kevlar Armor Pants in my inventory tomorrow and delete 2 million credits. Fair enough price for some ****ty but good looking pants.

Sheffy @ 6/10/2002 8:46:05 PM (29926):
Heh.

I'm seeing all sorts of bugs, or sync issues now.  Here's another one.  After dying, and while rezzing, my skills were going up as always.

Then, to heal myself, I tried casting a heal.

Look at my stats, and look at the output in the chat window here.  I had the same problem using my treatment packs even though my Treatment and T&S were far over the requirements to use the rechargers.

After I'm done rezzing, and it says "You feel ok again..", sometimes I *still* can not use the treatment packs which my skills should clearly allow, for about 60 seconds after rezzing.

Last night, I had MM/BM Mochams on my Doctor.  After they ran out (yes I'm sure they had terminated), I was able to continue casting very very high heals for the next 3-4 minutes, which I shouldn't have been able to do without the mochams.  Finally, 4 minutes after they ran out, I was finally unable to use the heals (which is how it should have been).

And here's another screenshot of the delayed damage by nothing after a fight when I wasn't even aggro'd during the fight.

I thought we had nipped these bugs in the bud a couple patches ago, and 14.2 just made everything way worse.  I'm trying to provide as much proof as possible so the developers have something to go on, but I question whether they will read this thread   I already emailed bugs@ with my first post, maybe I should do the same with this one.

--Tsk

Sheffy @ 6/10/2002 8:58:21 PM (29852):
The same goes for any kind of sleeves.  It's not a bug, the game has always worked that way so you don't have unmatching armor sleeves if you have two different types equipped.  They'll both be one or the other -- usually the one you equipped last (but sometimes zoning breaks that too )

I think the tattoo bit is gonna have to stay.

I've known a few people that got tripped up by this.  Some people never realize that they can wear a sleeve on each arm.  That alone points out a flaw in the user interface that should be corrected somewhere down the line.

Koomo @ 6/11/2002 3:41:49 AM (28076):
Hey man, I know what you are saying, I had 11 packs of blood plasma in the bank I had harvested to buy my new implants. So I log on and go to pull em out of the bank in Tir and suddenly crash, when I came back the 4 packs that had made it into my inventory were gone. This is my first char (only played AO a moth now) and in one week lost the 4 full packs of plasma and my BwT martial arts attack. The attack I lost when I went to my apartment for hte first time and my inventory was full, so the key (not going to an overflow window) just placed itself where my BwT used to be.  In the case of the special -though I felt they should have reimbursed me- it was not so bad as I can at least avoid that happening again, but with the bank, there was nothing at all I could have done, I never even finished grabing the packs to get a chance to save before the zone crashed. If they dont have time to look over the logs or whatever the goon above said I don't know, but its not wanting to be treated like the king of france man, its just wanting what was yours back, in my case I spent 2 days to harvest the plasma, 6 hours of RL time in those 4 packs for me so its not just my 13 bucks, its my time and a bit disapointing when it gets flushed. The reply to my FC e-mail was it disapoints the GM's to hear these things also, but the dont have the tools to help and the are pushing to have these tools very soon (no exact time given to me). Anyway, I know it sucks and I thought I would let you know you don't suffer alone, and if I was the King of france I would toss LaRes in the dungeon =P

Im a Fat Nano Breed and have been staring at my gun cutting 1/2 way through my belly for 8 months now... Is this EVER going to be addresed?  I cant even tell what the gun looks like unless im shooting at somthing because its uncomfortably lodged in my belly.  This seems like somthing that wouldnt be that hard to fix for a game so graphicly advanced.  Makes your game look slilly.

Guns- Why would anyone make a gun so small that my left hand holds nothing but air.  Looks like it would of been burnt off by now sticking out past ther barrel serving no purpose.  Make the bloody guns big enough to fit in the hands of the person shooting them.  This is especially bad with SMG's.

Terribly thought, pointless, or just worthless nanos dont seem to bother me as much as looking at my charachter now adays.  Im not sure what that means, but its not good.  If you cant take the time to fix the important things after being up and "110% playable" for almost a year, maybe someone can take the time to fix the little things ?

Oh and my Ninja is a joke.  He will forever more be named "Ninja who no navigate Door"

last thing...Who ever thought It was a good idea for a lvl 189 charachter with a ql200 shining implant to not be able to equip a ql 184 gun without suffering from OE penalty should be Fliking SPANKED.  I should be able to use a sol chironis, there not that good.  Maybe I should just go Flashpoint / Nova and quit trying to enjoy the game?

I am yet to ever see an official response on the state of shops.
It truely is as if Funcom believe they are working fine as the only in-game reply we get is "Go check all the shops".

Well hay, I've done that, for three days in a row and guess what?
Still no graft armour.

Im pretty sure something is wrong with Plumbo, my dear friend that I've killed 74 times now. He has not one time dropped that nice rare ring I want, only plenty of other invaluable rings.

I have spoken to many others that have killed Plumbo a lot of times too, and they never saw jack of the Ring.

Hmm strange thing is,  went to a few superior shops last night and saw various graft armors.

Graft Body, Helm and sleeves I believe.

Only one of them was a terminal-based supermarket however, the other two were vendors (one in 4holes and one in CLon**** I think, could be wrong though).

I've lost chat, suddenly, for no reason. First, I couldn't get anything displayed when I'd chatted it, then I tried zoning, no help, tried relogging, no help there either, even tried to reboot the machine, nothing. I'm using windows xp, so it's not that I'm using win95. I NEED to have this fixed...

ok people I read the chat thread

I am NOt a win 95 user I have win 2k

everything worked yesterday

I logged in today and low and behold it was working..  I zoned into tir and my chat stopped...  I zoned in to the grid and all my friend list  dissappeared and I still didn't have Any chat,

All my channels are missing  except for vicinity which doesn't work anyways.

So wtf do I do ? spend 4 hours or longer reinstalling ? like thats a option I want to do..

Wisewise @ 6/11/2002 7:43:24 PM (10016):

When this happened to me a few patches ago, I had to do a hard reinstall to fix it. A regular reinstall did not help. There are sticky threads in either Can't Get the Game Running or Other Technical Issues that can tell you how to do this.

And don't use the autopatcher! Don't let your friends use the autopatcher! Openly question why Funcom includes the autopatcher when it corrupts files every patch and manually patching is just as easy...

Celzia @ 6/11/2002 9:56:20 PM (30401):
Well...the crits on mobs seems to be TOTAL random.
Most of the times, the mob will crit me half of the time, but sometimes i run into a mob that only crits once or twize.
Like just now...an Enforcer type mob.
Compared to me that crits once every 5 - 10 fight, this is REALLY fubar.
This CANT be right.

RedSonja @ 6/11/2002 11:04:12 PM (28801):
Hummm, that's interesting.
I must admit I've only been doing the rounds at terminals and not so often at actual vendors.

Kailyn @ 6/12/2002 1:01:12 AM (BBI Faithful and parry 30457):
Holy smokes!!! 

I am a pistol adv (apprently a dying breed with the new melee adv loving that happened with the SOL Fires). Using BBI Faithfuls (the buffed pistol for adv's) I am now getting parried, I would guess 10-30% by all mobs. Worst was a pistol weild engineer mob parrying 50% of all my attacks, including 2 flings.


I never noticed fling being parried before and used to be able to count on it as damage on the mob. Not so any longer. I would say that parry rate is closer to 30%...but without logs (combat logs) to parse I can't give straight answers.

Can we please finally get BBIs on ranged init and dodge??

Vostof @ 6/12/2002 1:38:11 AM (Fix the problem with missing mission items 30465):

two days ago i got a single mission, where i should kill a mod. it was a real huge mission, so i needed about 2 hours to killing everyone. after i killed the final mod (mission objective) i wondered that i got no exp. after another 10 sec i wondered that the mission is still not completed: i still owned it, i got no tocken, no reward item, nothing.

ok, lets post a petition. done. waited about 5 hours!!! (maybe it is normal). i told to ark about my problem and only thing he/she sayd to me: it's a mission bug, we know about, sorry. ark also said they do not replace items, money or exp. f u c k. f u c k. f u c k.

funcom, i am very angry now: you are not informing people about bugs. how hard is to send weekly bug reports? how hard it to make a webpage with all bug listed? or do you fear about your reputation? 

so everybody, stop doing "kill mob" missions - you can also run into same situation as i did.

Steelbuns @ 6/12/2002 12:17:50 PM (30465):
If this happed to you in one of the brown cave type missions I might have a solution for the next time.

I happened to find the item after searching the huge mission twice with a friend *under* some large boxes.

There is a large room (usually holding two mobs) with a fireplace and a bunch of boxes stacked up in a corner.

One large box is sitting on top of various smaller boxes leaving a little space underneath.

I found some lootable chests there and in this one particular case the mission item.

Cheers

Taldrin @ 6/12/2002 12:32:56 PM (Bug with mission doors 30542):
There's a certain bugs that occurs in missions where you will try walk through a door, the doors will open but there will be a transparant blackness covering the way through which prevents anyone walking through. This only seems to happen with one of the rooms, and that is the room with 3 doors, rows of grey benches across it and a table at the front. The blackness seems to appear when you first open a door into that room and lasts about 10-15 seconds before disappearing. You can then walk through the doors as normal.

Anyone else experienced this?

I know it isn't just me because it stopped everyone in my team.

Kireth @ 6/12/2002 12:41:26 PM (No exp for Mobs standing in Green Acid 30544):
Title says it all.

If you kill a mob standing in green acid within a mission, then you get no XP for it. 

If you pull it out of the acid then you do.

rickenbacker @ 6/12/2002 12:44:02 PM (30401):

Yep, all those things SUCK.

Workaround for not being able to exit Avalon missions (which is a "known bug" according to the ark when I petitioned):  Zone in, put key in backpack, and you can run out when you need to.  Just gotta unbackpack the key to get back in.

And OH I know the pain of not being able to yalm up after I slayerdroid transference...

porkchop @ 6/12/2002 3:19:44 PM (Shortcut bar unuseable, no right clicking 30602):
Sometimes in mission areas my shortcut bar becomes unuseable. It's almost always in team mission areas. When this happens I can't right click on anything at all either. The only work around is to log out and log back in, which can't be done if you have aggro in a team mission area unless you leave the area.

Vostof @ 6/12/2002 4:18:03 PM (30465):
Yes, I know exactly what you're talking about Steelbuns.  My bud Expire showed me that 'trick' the other day.  Unfortunately in this situation I didn't see any stack of crates.  Even if the item is in the stack of crates, it's a bug that needs to be fixed.

Now save terminals are bugged? Amazing.  I don't think this game has had even one thing that isn't currently, or has been, bugged.  If they can't even get save terminals or yalms right, how can they possibly even consider making an expansion pack.  Oh well, once SWG arrives I can leave, maybe the dev team at Lucasarts knows what they are doing.

This is quite the mission bug.

Playing my lowly advent as the upper-lvl soldier game is boring beyond belief...

Anyway, picked a lvl 40 mission (first mission in a couple days with this toon) in Rome Green with the pickup and describe item being a nano crystal and the reward a Blue Man Group Chilled Plasteel Armor Helmet.

Go through clearing the mission, no X% chance of mission token message coming up (a posted change somewhere?) which I thought odd but also thought yeah, maybe FC did change it.

Found the item - it was a ql 39 Cast-Off Plasmaprojector.  Mission obviously didn't end, no reward and no token.

Game-play bug to say the least...

"Not all missions give tokens now."

You mean you go through an obscenely long mission in the upper-end game, clear the mission 100% and still won't get a token?  I saw no official posting of this change.

Glad my main already has the 1k board if that's the case...

And no, no other keys or missions in Green.  You seem to be missing the point - picked a lvl 40 mission, ended up being a lvl 39 on the inside with no possible way to complete the <PICKED> mission.

Just thought i should warn you all about this.
As i was looting my items out of reclaim today in broken shores the server fell down when i was halfway done looting. 
This caused me to lose all the items i already had looted out of the reclaim terminal, since they diseappered from the reclaim, but didnt show up in my inventory. 
Tried to petition about it, but all i got was a sorry, cant help you.. 
So i guess the morale of the story is, dont play with unstable servers, because if you do die and the server does down.... Well you end up like me i guess..

Now.. on a side issue.. How friggin hard can it be to save your char every time you add something to your inv? they seem to manage it every time something goes out, so why not when you add something aswell?

LightningMA @ 6/12/2002 10:25:06 PM (30674):
No, if it's 100% you always get a token.

Some missions (mainly small once), just don't give tokens and you don't see a % message during the mission.

However, most times, % starts to show from fifth mob, so you can't tell from the start.

Waffen @ 6/12/2002 10:50:54 PM (30674):
Yeah Moshe_Be, thanks but I know all that.  It was the standard indoor-office mission in the city, not some small cave mission like you might get in Clon**** around that level.

I would estimate kills around the 40-50 range, with not one X% chance of getting a mission token message.

And the wrong item in the mission...

"Parry
A very useful skill for melee combat specialists, as it will enable them to prevent incoming attacks from melee and martial arts. The higher the skill, the higher the chance. Depends 50% on strength, 20% on agility, and 30% on sense."

hehe Funcom...
btw, I hope that gun don't use ammo 'cus what it looks like now you must be slapping the gun in their faces to make the mobs able to parry.

My guess is that the parry skills of the mobs was raised because of our loved MA crit buffs went self only, a nerf to make MAs do less damage wich hits other melee classes as well.

Nepenthea @ 6/13/2002 12:18:23 PM (28801):
Greetings, 

Most unfortunately, not only has the "UNIQUE" tag been removed from martial arts special attacks, but some of the martial arts special attacks have been removed from the stores altogether. 

I have not found Blessed with Thunder, after 14.2, in any shops.

None of the advanced or superior shops have Blessed with Thunder (or Bird of Prey, either). 

None of the OT Special Attack Trainers or Specialists in 2H0 have Blessed with Thunder. 

However, now Flower of Life and Shen are showing up in these stores and on those merchants. But NO Blessed with Thunder nor Bird of Prey is showing up. 

I've only seen Bird of Prey in basic shops a few times, and the few that show up, for the most part, no longer give a QL, but say SPECIAL instead. The BoPs now available seem to be very low in damage (quality level), very rarely anything higher than equivalent to QL 25.

Currently, the only way to find any Blessed with Thunder or a QL50+ Bird of Prey is through missions--and certainly not at the optimum QL at which an MA can use those special attacks.

Has there been official word from Funcom, regarding Blessed with Thunder and Bird of Prey no longer being available in advanced and superior shops? 

Is this unavailability "intended" or something which needs to be corrected by Funcom? Funcom made no mention of various martial arts special attacks no longer being available in stores in the 14.2 patch notes. 



Tiran mentioned in this post: 
http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sh...?threadid=29012 

["Shop inventory is hosed in 14.2, yes. Reported, repeatedly, even daily, on testlive. Ignored by Funcom." 

"Armor especially is very badly messed up, you will find, for instance, that only helm and boots of metaplast show in advanced, basic tech is entirely gone from advanced, etc, etc."

"Most armors are available only in a few pieces, not complete sets, now, from stores. Try the neutral stores, they have different (though still limited) selections." 

"Yes, specifically reported BwT missing from stores."] 



The question remains: Is Blessed with Thunder (and Bird of Prey) supposed to not be available in advanced and superior stores anymore? (And if so, what is the reasoning/rationale behind those special attacks not being available in stores any more?)

My MA is at the level she can now use BwT, and...now....it's no where to be found in stores--and I wasn't paranoid enough to think I should "stock up" before the patch. 

This sadens me greatly. I truly hope Blessed with Thunder will be available again in shops. Soon. 

Funcom, please make the MA Special Attacks: Blessed with Thunder and Bird of Prey available in advanced and superior shops again, thank you.

Be well.

Anyone who has seen or equipped the shoulderpads from dodga (not sure about the omni ones havent seen em) knows that the left pad skins too far forward. I am wearing very light tank with them to try and cover up the bug as much as possable but thats not an acceptable solution.

I know that normally this would not be an issue to take a priority but with just about everyone over lvl 50 trying to get thier hands on the parts to complete this quest on RK2 alone there are going to be alot of people running around with messed up looking shoulder pads. 

This should be a simple problem to fix along with all the other little visual bugs with models like how Opifex still get a broken neck when wearing cloaks.

AlexX @ 6/14/2002 1:07:30 AM (Bug when putting Small Backpack into Bank? 30940):
Hi all,

This seems like a bug, so I was hoping it had happened to someone else and that there was a work-around trick for it.

Sometimes when I put a small backpack into the bank, it creates a graphic in the bank, but doesn't actually move the item out of my inventory.  When I then click on this "ghost" image in the bank, the graphic disappears.

Oddly enough, sometimes if I just move any item into the bank, a "ghost" image of a small backpack pops up!  If you left click it it disappears.

I can't tell if it's the backpack that's somehow corrupted, or something in my bank.  This happens consistently now - it's not a one-time thing.

Anyway - just hoping someone's seen this before....

thanks

Bilitis @ 6/14/2002 9:53:59 PM (IPR Bug. I am dead 31202):
I had an issue with my character named Tombac (Soldier lvl148) with IP reset.
 
3 Days ago i used the full reset option in order to try different weapons hoping i would prefer them. Everything went perfectly.
 
Today i decided to go back to previous settings since shotties suck, knowing i had 8 ipr pts to use.
 
I resetted 8 of my skills, and arranged my IP pts exactly the way i wanted them.
 
When i accepted the changes, I ended up with skills i did not want maxed out (and that i obviously didn't raise), and thoses i need and that i carefully selected when placing ip empty or set all wrong.
 
I do not have any ipr pts left and im stuck.
 
I talked to someone from ARK after waiting 3 hours who told me that he could not do anything and suggested me to write bugs.

After sending many e-mails i finally got an answer from support, wich is :

------------------------------------------------------

"First of all I am so sorry to hear you experience problems with Anarchy Online.

As far as I understand there was an issue with something visual on peoples clients if you used IP reset points without clicking accept after the changes was made each time.

At the moment we have no way to fix this as the bug is visual on the client only there is no direct 'fault' we can see in the logs that it happened.

We might have a later update on this later but until then I am so sorry but we are not able to do anything in this case.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience along with any problems this has caused.

Best Regards

--------------------------------------------------------------

* At the moment my character is unable to use is weapons, to fly or cast important nano. I cannot do anything and need help.

Today i sent a petition in order to talk to a gm, waited 4 hours sat down waiting for nothing, and when my petition got to 0 in queue it has been deleted. Waited 1 more hour, and no answer.

What am I supposed to do? delete my character and loose manys months of my life?

I do not know what to do,so if anyone read this and can help, please do.

Crestfire @ 6/15/2002 12:47:32 PM (Extreme unbalanced missions 31342):
It seems that the difficulty of a mission doesn't have a whole lot to do with its quality level. Here are my experiences:

- At lvl 82 I play QL 125 missions, the exp I get varies from 12k to 28k, averagely 22k exp / mob.

- At lvl 92 I play QL 135 missions, exp goes from 12k tot 32k.

This all is ok, but at lvl 94 I'm forced to play QL 120 mission, because it jumps from QL 120 to 145, and 145 is totally impossible to solo at my lvl.

- At 94 I'm forced to play QL 120 mission, which give me 6k-8k / mob. I tried 3 QL 120 mission today and they all gave me 6k-8k exp. Which is 3 times less exp than a  QL 125 mission.

- I play a QL 120 solo mission in team at lvl 94, we get 8k-12k exp.

- I play a QL 110 mission at lvl 82, grouped with a lvl 65 enforcer, we get 10k-14k exp.

This doesn't make any sense at all, basically at my current lvl, 94, I get less exp in mission than I was getting from 75-92. Also in QL 120 missions 70% of the mobs are yellow.

If they would allow us to chose the QL of a mission with more precision this problem could partically be solved. Right now, by sliding the difficulty bar from normal to 100% hard you will only get 4 different QL's to chose from.

Crestfire @ 6/15/2002 3:06:54 PM (31342):
Hmm, seems like I had some very bad luck, 5 QL 120 missions in a row gave me 6k-8k exp / mob, but now I just played one with 10k-20k exp / mob. Still shouldn't be possible to get that low exp ...

Cyberpixie @ 6/15/2002 5:00:46 PM (IP Reset Graphical Bug? Tech Supp Will Not Answer My Email 31373):
Please goto this thread, which has been running since the patch on the 14.2 Patch Day Forum.

http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sho...threadid=30085

This outlines an alledged 'graphical bug' caused by using more than one IP Reset Point at once before hitting accept. This is a matter that gravely needs to be addressed by tech support.

My Adventurer IS still sitting naked in Omni Entertainment General Store with her implants and NCU out waiting after a week to see if tech support will take a closer look at the character.

I repeat this is my MAIN character, she is level 64 and I reset her STR to up my MULTIRANGE so that I could try pistols.

I used one point to reset RIFLE, then one point to reset STR and dumped all this into pistol and upped MULTIRANGE to 256 which is the requirements for the QL 70 Kaen's she had. 

I then dumped the rest, about 33k, into my nano skills.

I hit ACCEPT

I tried to equip both pistols.

I couldn'nt since my MULTIRANGE was no longer 256 BUT 50!

On the other hand, the IP from my STR were completely gone!

I was left with NO MULTIRANGE skill or STR to speak of.

I left my implants and NCU off (except I forgot I had a QL 10 pistol implant on my wrist which is probably what showed up on the ARKs 'tool' as being = to 89 points too many)

I petitioned.

I waited 90+ minutes

I had to goto bed for work so I was unable to finish the que.

The next evening I logged on, saw a message from the ARK who had missed me and asked I re-petition, which I did.

I waited 2 hours.

An ARK did NOT even show up in front of me.

The ARKs stock answer to my problem was I had 89 IP points too many (no doubt due to the silly QL 10 implant I had in) and therefore there is nothing he can do. He urged me to write tech support.

I emailed tech support, I recieved a standard form reply. I have recieved nothing since. 

I feel this is simply shoddy customer service. This is my main character, one I have worked very hard on and this was to be her 'remaking'. A chance to set her points better and maybe get to able to play her and stop goofing off on alternate characters. 

I simply want someone to reply 'Yes we will look into it' or 'No, now go away you silly woman' to my email.

Members of my Organization have also tried petitioning and emailing FC on my behalf, to no avail. The only answer recieved thus far, is the one from the ARK who could'nt even be bothered to tell me in person that he thought I was cheating or pulling his leg.

I need a member of tech support to contact me regarding ticket[Funcom Support #182103] as soon as possible. I will continue to post this message on any and all venues until I recieve an answer to this tech support issue.

If they send the bots to all 1 hour spawns, I hope someone takes out a flashpoint and alphas some sense into them.

People are bad enough at TK because he can drop TL6 bracers and some neat items. (note: nerfing bracers = wrong. having bracers show up in more than 1 in 10000 chests/mobs = right)

All bots 5 min spawn, so people who are capable of killing a mob actually get a chance at doing the quest, instead of being blocked out by a team of 3 soldiers twinking alts into pads at the minimum level and/or deleting the ID chip just to be jerks while they bracer farm.

BTW far too many people are having trouble bugging them. Yes, you can bug them under attack, but people keep telling eah other they can't. Mostly its the bugging just not working.

Aristaeus @ 6/15/2002 7:26:38 PM (31023):
About the bugging.
You need luck (and some strategic insight) around Greasy to A) tag him & get the bug mission. Then B) bug him.
If greasy lasts more then 5 seconds it's a miracle. No one will take the risk that someone else will hit Greasy before they do and put in just that one hit more for the most damage.

So it is try to tag and if this works on the first try wait an hour (due to the lag on the mission completion) to bug him.

Hypos @ 6/15/2002 8:01:58 PM (Info window bug 31399):
Try this:

1. Select a reclaim terminal
2. shift-left click on a nano in your hotkey bar
3. press T

Result: an info box for the terminal that includes the requirements for the nano.  In my case, the reclaim terminal said it was doctor only with requirements along the lines of BioMet 530, MatMet 500, T&S 500

I've noticed this also works with mission terminals and doors.  Probably happens with any selectable object that does not have requirements for use.

This is the most annoyingly overcamped thing at the moment.  Greasy Joints doesn't even get to live 10 seconds after he spawns literally.  I've seen people doing so much damage that there were 12 shots before he died.   There are at the least 25 individual people camping him 24 hours a day.  During the day there's close to twice that.   This game is turning into EverCamp and fast.  I've been trying to get the unit for the third quest since the third day the mission existed and I wouldn't be able to outdamage all those people no matter what I did.  Just change the freaking time to 10-15 minutes and stop the camping insanity.

that weapon is not at least 67% bow so it wont have the special (its mostly rifle)

by that logic the solider pistols would have bow special attack because they use arrows (and are pistols/heavy weapons)

Might just be me, but I've only noticed being actually hit by NPCs burst a handful of times (maybe 7) since I started to play.

And my dodges really do suck, so it isn't that .

In fact, Bursts are the only specials I've been hit by at all from NPCs...

PC based specially pretty much always hit regardless of skill.  Wouldn't think too much either way if I was never hit by Burst, but the sporadic behavior concerns me a bit.

Yes, but at least with the lackey if you have to do a 2-step bug (ie. first tag/complete 'look at mission', then wait for next spawn and do the 'bugging') this only takes a maximum of 29 minutes for lackey (get there 1 minute after death, wait 14 - look at, wait 15 - bug), but at Greasy Joints - it can take 1 hour 59 minutes - and it literally did take me that long.  Spending this much time doesn't make the game more fun, or much more satisfying that you got the item and nobody else did - it just makes it frustrating and boring.

The other thing with the lackey and other 15 min spawn bots is that at *all* of those bots (except sometimes lackey) everyone is friendly and will wait for you to do your tag - cause even if someone else tried to kill it - the worst that could happen is they need to wait another 15 minutes.  With a one hour spawn nobody is prepared to take that chance, so they kill ASAP.  The attitude at Greasy Joints of people gets nasty and rude - it brings out the worst in everyone, cause it's frustrating and people hate it.  Please don't continue to make the same mistake with other unique mobs and *increase* the time on all of them - just make this one also 15 minutes and make people happy for a change - PLEASE

Sorry to hear about this. 

About a week ago I sent a petition about something (I forget what) at the beginning of my play time. Hours later I remembered I had an active petition and checked it's status only to find out there was no petition any more. I was venting about it in guild chat when someone told me petitions get deleted after three or four hours (he wasn't sure) if they aren't either answered by an ARK or updated by you. Needless to say, I was pissed off. Sounds lke this happened to you, too. Why should any petition be deleted, even if the person goes offline?

So what does your reclaim terminal do when you use it? Those are pretty high reqs, it had better do something special!

Evilspork @ 6/17/2002 7:59:12 AM (31473):
Do Virral eggs show on your character? Never seen one, and never thought to ask before.

Also, can a sided character wear two pads? I know they're unique, but could you earn a level 3 pad then start the quest over again and build the second pad up to level 2 then wear that also?

Evilspork @ 6/17/2002 8:06:35 AM (31023):
Hell, why aren't all the mobs on 5 minute spawns? Or insta-spawns? It's not like any level pad is that powerful, they're just nice to have for some extra hp/np/ac. Everyone should have them. It's not like Tarasque's Right Nut which lets you clone Mini-Tarasque Pets from, FFS!

I met some "leet" people near GJ today.  Six lvl 150+ people, half wearing pads, killed Slacky Joints in 2 second... by the time my hand reached the tab key GJ was already dead.

Guess what they said..

"forget about tagging it, we aren't going to wait for you."

some others uber people said...

"those people lower than lvl 100 should leave now, you aren't going to get it anyways so why bother besides adding up lag for us."

I tested it with treatment and imps, didn't work
Don't really know which skills are affected by this bug, treatment and runspeed were the only skills (actually no ip to do more tests  )

I felt like checking out the Junk Yard and starting the dodga quest, as a change to missions the other day. I thought now the quest is fixed it could be a fun alternative, and  it was always kinda quiet there when I missioned there at lower levels before.
 After turning up and seeing maybe 30 omni players and a few clanners all camping the place and  bickering over the TK drops I decided missions wern't so bad after all and went back to BS. *sigh*
If you want to give ppl something different to do, how about making it feasable and fun Unlike every other alternative to missions which are severly overcamped and way too competitive for something thats supposed to be  fun.

Frustration and time wasting really turns ppl off these options.

faster spawns, more bots dropping the needed parts, bump.

Ql of Mobs varies way to much in solo mission. 

We did some 190s and ALL the Mobs were Yellow!! (we are a lvl130ish team), then did a 192 full of Real Means.. is there no consistency?

At least team missions seem more balanced, but please even the level of Mobs in solo missions. Taking a well prepared team into a ql190 and then getting 13k a kill is a bit of a dissapointment.

I wish they would increase the spawn but we have asked and asked for that in cases like the Lab Director and Funcom doesn't even bother answering, much less doing anything about it.

So, since they don't want to do that: have the named robots in the Dodga quest all spawn completely randomly in their zone. LiveMetal could be anywhere in Greater Tir County from Bot Mountain to the Cyborg dungeon to Sandworm territory. Trash King and Lackey (together or separate) might be sunning on the beach or haunting War Academy in Athen Shire.

Graxxus @ 6/17/2002 6:50:01 PM (Concealment desynching when entering visual range 31831):
I have been seeing two bugs plague my agent and the groups I've been in.

When entering a player's visual range in sneak there is a very good chance that you will be sneaking but still visible to that player.

When not in sneak mode and you move outside of a player's visible range and then back into it again you may become invisible to that player eventhough you are not in sneak mode.

A similar thing happens with mobs.  Mobs that are brought from a location outside of the player's visual range into the player's visual range sometimes are invisible to that player.  If the mob that is invisible attacks the player then they are attacked for phantom damage and can die to an invisible mob that they can't see.

The only ways to be able to see invisible mobs or invsible players is for the player to move out of the visual range(map radar range) of the invisible mob or player(often a teammate in a mission) and then move back into visual range again.

Teammates should always be able to detect teammates that are in sneak mode.  The invisibility effect should only occur to everyone that is not in the group.

Invisible teammates cannot be targeted to be healed however team heals do work for team members in sneak...unsure if it does for invisible team members not in sneak mode but from my experience they don't seem to be.

Desynching of invisibility seems to be related.  

And as a side note please fix these issues with concealment and stop allowing sympathetic, speeches, and new short duration 12s automatically refreshing nanos from breaking concealment.  When a profession using these nanos is in a group it is impossible for me to use aimed shot because concealment constantly is being disengaged.  With 14.4 even more professions will be disengaging concealment in this manner...please I beg of you fix this.

If they increased the spawn it would create even bigger problem (go see what happens at Nugget and other uniques when the 18 hour spawn time hits), faster spawn is working "ok" with other bots so why not do that with GJ as well.

Make them spawn randomly all over a absolutely huge zone like Greater Tir County? Well that's just silly in my opinion. Quests need to be some what challenging, not impossible.

So i look at the hologram i have (im a agent) and notice that it does not have agent as a requirement (and no they where not fp they where a real doc and enforcer) so i ask around and alot of agent shave noticed this too.  I know the holograms are in the initial stages but i just wanted to bring this to light in case it wasnt a known bug.

Graxxus @ 6/18/2002 12:16:40 AM (31785):
I only use the short cut bar now to organize nanos.  My favorites tab used to be full of my often used current buffs but I've had to stop using it because after a while the GUI would become unable to keep the nanos I organized in the right place.  After a while nanos would slowly dissapear from favorites to its default category tab (random location in that tab) until finally there weren't any nanos left in favorites.

Agent FP is another one. You get a message across the screen "False Profession Enforcer will terminate in 10 seconds. 10 seconds pass, and sure enough, the you get a message "False Profession "X" terminated. Its not in your NCU, but if you target yourself, and press T, your still in that False Profession. This can take up to 3-5 minutes to correct itself. Not a big of a problem as taking damage after the mob is "Dead" but irritating nevertheless.

How is it not impossible now? 

But seriously folks, a random location spawn would get people to explore these huge zones we have, if only for a part to a low end item. It would hardly be impossible, and truly make it a challenge.

When their logs don't show it, what are they going to do? Trust him on his word? It might seem nice, but the second they do it a thousand kids will run and say they too had the same bug and need a full reset.

If the logs don't show it they can't do anything, a "nice" policy would be exploited to no end.

If you honestly don't think it will then just think back to the Alvin/Dodga mission pre patch. The people who ganked and ganked, do you think they wouldn't take the opportunity to lie to Funcom if they had a "nice" refund policy?

You don't heal up...just the client gets updated 

If you didn't max body dev for instance and spend IPs on it, but don't hit accept, you will see that with the HP regeneration it will slowly fill it up. So as long as you have the skill window opened you have extra HPs...but everyone maxes Body dev anyway and having the skill window always up and waiting for the HP to regen naturally isn't really fun 

Same goes for nanopool and some other stuff...hehe.

Didn't bother to figure out if it's only visual tho, quite possible.

  Funcom knew about this since 13.8. I sent bug report afer bug report to FC on this same issue. I left the game for DAOC around that time due loosing a level and a half total xp on my main and approx a level on an alt. DAOC really sucked( to be blunt) so I came back. I had also suggessted that they focus a bit more on bugfixes before they change the way the game is played, but after 14.2( phantom hits surfaced for me in 13.8) the problem still exists. I really hate to pick at funcom but it is soooo easy. Big gameplay problem not addressed(or resolved after 2 patches) and a lot of focus directed elsewhere.

The weapon is clearly called a crossbow, looks like crossbow, smells like a crossbow it's a crossbow.  Asquari Chemicical Rifle uses flame thrower ammo, by your logic(Oberon) it should be a flame thrower.  

Also some Bow special attacks take longer than 5 minutes to recharge depends on the arrow of choice.

Moreover, where is this "ruling" or explanation of what makes a bow not or not have a bow special attack, seems like more Funcom arbitary BS. Until I see this from an official rep, I think it is fair to assume this weapon is bugged.

Look Im not trying to be an ass, It just seems wrong. What more than likely happened is they just plain forgot to code it.  So give bow users some love and fix this.

Quick rundown of what happened to me last night.

I go to Alvin.  I get the quest.

I acquire the parts.  Assemble them.

I go back to Alvin and give him the assembled brain thing.  Mission Complete.

But I don't get a card!! So now I can't continue my quest...


This annoyed me.  So I decided to put in for a petition.
I hang out online for 4 hours waiting for my petition to reach the front of the queue.  It goes 3... 2... 1... 0 in front.  Then... "You have no petitions in the queue".  I figure... I'm about to get to ask what happened!!! But no.  No one contacts me.  No one appears before me...  Nothing.  A complete waste of a night.

So I put in another petition.. and sure enough, after about 5 mintues.. my petition was moving forward again... so I know SOMEONE was answering these things.  They just chose to ignore me.

Why to hell they don’t answer.

Well, I am trying to do that 3rd time now. 
Waiting and waiting, and typing this.

What happened is this:

We were in the advanced shop at NL. Me and MA.
He was agreed to sell me her old Ma implants set. And he was helping me same time to transfer some money to my main to my alt MA. So we agree that he get that money and give rest to my alt.

So he give me the money and keep the money what we were agreed to is a prize of the implants set. He hit accept button and then I hit the accept button. No happened the tricky part, I get my money but not implant backpack. I ask him to give me the implants. He doesn’t have them anymore, and I don’t see them my inventory. We zone, zone, re-log. Nothing, the pack of implants is gone, totally.

No the MA are wondering what a hell happened? And he give me my money back, because we now that we are not scammers.

I just feel so sorry about this, that why I try and try petition. But I don’t get any answers.

Ok, I've had it. Every patch since release (except a few down the middle I missed) I've been waiting for the fix to the most pressing problem in the game:

Whompas are supposed to make more noise than the door opening. They should go "WHOM!" when you enter and "PAH!" when you exit. Hence the name. It's in the manual. How hard can it be, just put the intern on it. (Actually it seems that the intern is currently busy smoking crack and designing fixes to broken classes, but once he is done he can fix this problem.)

I avoided walking on the metal grate part(that has a tendency of letting you fall through it into the water) by walking along the sloped wall area, but as I went off the edge of the wall onto the non grated floor I received 333 points of fall damage.

Xlot @ 6/20/2002 12:49:53 PM (Can't buff pets in mixed team 32582):
Hi, I play an Omni crat.

I've noticed that if I'm in a team with Omni and Clan folks, (i.e. the team is "neutral"), that after zoning once with the pet, I'm unable to buff my droid, as his side becomes "neutral", which isn't *my* side. 

Could this be fixed so that the droid (or charmed pet) stays Omni, so I can rebuff him as necessary?

Xlot, rk2.

Codewitch @ 6/20/2002 7:06:23 PM (32544):
Well, there is no search function alas, and google didnt find it either.  If this is a problem because my character is Opifex, then its a bug and really needs to be fixed! How could it not have been fixed by now?  I was so lookin forward to playing a bow user and this is the avatar/breed I want, need since bow is light blue and fligshot green for her.  I am not changing my avatar...any word from the devs on a solution to this in an upcoming patch?

I understand what you said, but...

I am pretty sure Fc can look at my skill and imagine* that a soldier lvl 148 with stats like sense at max and no gun skills is not really normal...

I am sure you can imagine all the time involved in making a lvl148 character and that it might be worth the effort.

I understand that you are dead if they don't help. (Well, that your toon is, hopefully you survive.)

Yes, FC can look at your character and see that he isn't a very optimal soldier. You have no gun skills, so it's obvious you got borked somehow.

But the next soldier, with Bow as his only weapon skill. Is it as obvious for him?

Using common sense is unfortunately not a good idea, it's too easy to exploit. It's a sad, sad world, but when making PR decisions you have to take into account that about 25% of the population is willing to rob you blind. (This is probably a low figure on the internet. I polled my friends with computers and came to the conclusion that the average 25 year old comp sci student has STOLEN for $10,000. No innovation in the history of man has lowered morals as much as the internet. This is on the assumption that a CD costs $15, a game $30 and a DVD $20.)

People who in real life wouldn't say the F world use such a lot of profanities online that the most hardened sailor would turn pale if he heard it.

And everyone is making out like bandits.

Yes, their logs SHOULD show it.

But in the real world there is a limit to how much data you can plow down into a DB without slowing it down. In an ideal world ALL transactions should be saved indefinitely so that anything like this that happens won't be repeated.

Unfortunately it takes time to update the DB, so you have to cut corners. The database is pretty big, and most likely stretched to the limit. It's not like a minor Norwegian company has the same computing power that Nasa does. (Nasa have the worlds biggest and fastest DB, atleast outside classified military stuff. But I don't think even the military beats them.)

I try to explain WHY they are pricks. An explanation isn't an excuse. 

How much is it worth to you that their logs always show this? That it takes another 0.1 second before your character reacts to commands? Another 0.2 seconds? Another 0.5 seconds? Another 1.0 seconds? Only a finite number of things can be done per second.

It's a smaller scale, but it's still economics. You have 200 bucks. Health care costs 100 bucks, your childs school costs 100 bucks and your childs dental plan costs 100 bucks. Which do you ditch?

Face it: Something ALWAYS has to go, and someone gets hurt by it.

I think it's better to understand WHY than to just scream "IT'S NOT FAIR GOD!" to the grey sky!

RedSonja @ 6/22/2002 7:24:52 PM (Wait a sec....I cannot roll QL200 missions Grrrr 33025):
Well now that I can meet up with a couple of friends more regularly online I thought it was maybe about time we did some QL200 missions, purely so we could all get some QL200 items to grow into.
I'm Level 116 and know that I should be able to roll a QL200 mission, oh how wrong could I be!!!

If I move the slider all the way to the right I only get 2 choices of mission reward, DNA locked blasters at QL206 and QL206 MP nano.
If I drop the slider just a small amount to the left the maximum level I can roll is QL174.

So, has this been broken recently?
What am I doing wrong, why can I not roll a standard QL200 mission?

LordMaxwell @ 6/22/2002 10:32:24 PM (33025):
The mission system only has a few set levels you can get missions at. Don't let the slider fool you, it's only really 11 different levels tops.

Here is a link to when you get 200 exactly missions: <A HREF="http://vnboards.ign.com/message.asp?topic=29840803">check it out</A>

Well, atleast some of the levels are listed.

RedSonja @ 6/22/2002 10:41:03 PM (33025):
Yup, I knew that there were only a few locations on the slider that actually mattered, although I actually thought it was less than 11 different ones.

Anyway it now gets really annoying as there are only certain levels when you can roll up Level 200 missions and this is crazy.
Once you go over Level 112 with your character rolling such missions are suddenly near impossible.
At character Level 154 I can then roll Level 200 missions again and that is it until I'm actually Level 200.

Just adding this thread to the "game play" bugs as I think this is crazy, Level 200 missions are certainly not reserved for Level 200 characters only, it's the way to get that equipment or armour we need and there has to be a way from say Character Level 112 onwards where you should always be able to roll a Level 200 mission if you want one.

Not that I'm complaining, but I thought you should know.

yes you can wear a pads of interest and a pads of will or a pads of will and a pads of dedication or even a pads of interest and a pads of dedication.

LordMaxwell @ 6/23/2002 9:16:43 AM (33025):
I doubt that there is a plan behind it, but if there is a plan behind it then it's to restrict the easiest route to ql 200 items.

You still get ql 200 rewards by blitzing a ql 206 mission for example. (Well, a very few select things go over 200, but most blitzed for items don't.)

Due to Aces/Real Means no one plays level 190-200 missions for real. From 110-200 teams do 184-189 diff missions. 90 levels of the same mission level, and FC wonders why people get bored...

Harmonizer, I think your referring to Perpetual Waste Lands regarding the 700 Map Nav.  Though I have no idea where it even is.


PS While I'm venting, Make Yalms CHEAPER or else make the missions within realistic distance from the booth (for christ sake, all of my missions (clanner here) are either in the most NE corner of Mort or else in Omni Stret East Bank.  Wasted 3 hours running, dying, respawing just to get to the mission site).  I'm sure you will get a consensous opinion from us folks not fortunate enough to have had someone buy us a yalm.  It's somewhat fatiguing reminding myself that this game is supposed to be fun.

Camping the mission booth for 2 hours to get a mission followed by another hour of running really DOES suck.  Factor in the mission time and your looking upwards of 4 to 5 hours just to get a nano crystal or piece of armor?

Petition and insist that you want to see an GM. ARK tried to fend me off for like an half hour about this, I eventually managed to persuade her to set me on the GM attention queue. After 2 hours or so a GM came and gave me the second quest & the quest items.

skybert @ 6/24/2002 7:53:17 AM (33077):
it's dependent on title-lvl.

You start by getting one mission token (at lvl 1), and get an additional token to your board for each title lvl when uploading tokens.

When I was around lvl 90-ish, I got four token to my board for each missiontoken.
Now, at lvl 101, I get five.

One could almost begin to think that FunCom didn't want everyone to have this item.....

skybert @ 6/24/2002 8:09:28 AM (33215):
you are still, technically, in the same area.  If someone goes up, while you're sitting there, they might see the mobs running at a wall, trying to reach you.

But in teammissions, you are in a team.  Have another teammember go up, take aggro, and then you may heal again.

I and another was doing teammisisons, and in the bossroom, we ended up doing a tag-team-thingy.

i.e.: I go up, bash until I need to heal, go down.
He goes up while I heal, As soon as I'm fully heales, I go up again, which was about the same time as he needed to go down and heal. (no, none of us were a healer-class).  It worked just about fine.  

It is annoying, yes, but to change that, I think they have to make us zone for each lvl, and that means more loading graphics, people going linkdead while zoning and teammissions would take longer time......WAIT! DAMNIT!  FunCom: do not read this!  This is not an acceptable way to force us using longer time to reach high lvl! Do not use! *attempts a jedi mind-trick on FunCom* "you did not read this"

skybert @ 6/24/2002 8:15:33 AM (32952):
happened to me, not long ago.

I petitioned about it and met a nice ARK.
(don't think I've talked to ARKs not beeing nice)

He told me he had had the same problem himself.  When he got there, I had been out, getting a few more lvls, and were in town to see if I could upgrade som more NF's (it was with one of my alts, around lvl 10-15, when the lvls really pour in, if you put some effort into it, and know what you're doing).

Anyway, I tried buying the nano from the very same shopagain, and guess what?  No error-message.  No problems buying it whatsoever.  I told him, he said he launched off a report, and waved goodbye.

It is a bug that should not exist, but the work-around, is to try again later.  Or try another shop, if there's one nearby. (zoning in and out might work. haven't tried that one.)

Paramp @ 6/24/2002 8:28:52 AM (32165):
Kits, special attacks, everything are out of sync. When you get the message that "[whatever] is available" you need to wait 1-4 seconds before it actually becomes available.

This is probably because the server and the client do their own timekeeping. The "[whatever] is available" must come from the client only - but the rebuff ("available in 2 seconds") probably comes from the server. OR they other way around. But the client and the server are definitely out of sync.

As for dual-wielding and specials, I whole-heartedly agree. A very simple way of fixing this would be to simply halve the specials' recharge time when you're dual wielding - but only for the weapon-based ones! If an MA is dual-wielding a claw, dimach recharge should not be halved. But flingshot, burst, full auto - yes please! I have two weapons, let me use them as two.

This is a serious bug ihmo.

Not only does it prevent you from healing/recharging, but team members who have gone LD / crashed cannot rejoin the team as they "are in a fight".

This caused 50% of the time spent in a teammission yesterday to be troubleshooting, trying to figure out who was in a fight, moivng away and coming back, relogging, reforming team...

What it boils down to is this :

When someone moves to another level in a dungeon, all fights with that player should terminate.

MartekO @ 6/25/2002 2:07:46 PM (33215):
I don't know...

Sure it would be a nice convenience to be able to just transport back up and heal.  But is this a "bug"?  I am not so sure.  Is it impossible to heal after transportingback up?  No!

All you have to do is move far enough away from the transporter to be out of "fight range".  You can then sit and heal.  I do it all the time.  It's similar (exact same thing maybe) to rooting a mob on the same floor and then moving out of its range and healing.

If you don't feel like doing that - well then just keep trying to heal!  Eventually (meaning usually just a few seconds) one of your teammates should get the attack.  At the moment you can heal, even right at the transporter.

As I say, it would be a nice convenience to have the fight "terminate" upon entering the transporter.  But this isn't a hard-and-fast "you cannot heal on the previous level" thing at all; even though it is being presented as such in this thread.  I certainly would not agree it is a serious bug.

Strategy!

Cheers,
Martek

But OHH BOY, the system sure as hell isn't fair.

MartekO @ 6/25/2002 3:58:32 PM (33215):
For me it "usually" works, while your experience is that it "rarely" works.

I acknowledge you are much higher level (my highest is level 79), so that may have something to with it.  But what?  Hmmmm...

My experience thus far is missions don't get smaller as you level upwards.  (Sure there is mission-to-mission variation, and locations seem toaffect missions size, but "generally" speaking they do not get smaller).

Seems that "logically", a "smaller" mission would be harder to get far enough away to get out of fight range.  So offhand it would seem that higher-level missions (generally speaking again) would be "easier" to move far enough away, not harder (because in general they should not be smaller than lower level missions).  I wonder what else explains our different experiences?

In any case, however, my main point was to say that it "can" work, versus the report in this thread that it "doesn't" work (more precisely, that we are "prevented" from healing).  I don't believe it can be termed a "serious bug", which was the point I was trying to make.

Again, sure it would be a nice convenience.  Sure I would like it. But on the flip side, not everything should be made so easy for everyone.  But every inconvenient thing should not be called a serious bug.

Cheers,
Martek

It might have something to do with the mission layout actually. But the odd thing was that while I could, as you say, run a few rooms off and then heal the first time, doing the exact same thing failed every time after that. 

And I dont think it was the level either, as this was a level 21 alt of mine...

And I suppose we could say it is a matter of convenience to be able to heal, recharge and re-recruit LD members...its a matter of your point of view I guess

Ya know, i was originally doing the Alving quest so i could get the pads.  Which are very cool, and I'm happy.  Except for that fact that i didn't get the xp that the reward says i got.  The reward for the 3rd pads was 150k exp.  I'm like sweet! that should lvl me.  Alas no, i only got 7500 exp.  So i petition, and after speaking with a gm for quite some time he blatently says "What i say is law, there is nothing else i can do"  So i'm like wtf, i have been paying for this game since the begning, so i ask to speak with his boss, that doesn't happen.  AFter bickering with him for a while, he says you have to e-mail support there is nothing else i can do, good bye.

So wtf, because of a bug i don't get my reward?  I'm sorry but because of a problem with your software i loose, and you won't reimburse me?  I spent like 8 hours on this quest and i don't get the full reward.  Ok well i sent an e-mail, i do expect to get this exp.  It can't be that hard to fix, i mean come on.

That weapon is mostly rifle, only got crossbow look and 33 bow attack rating. I think its lacking of special attack is intentional.
But anyway, bow special attack is somewhat useless and got /wave animation.

Meegor @ 6/26/2002 11:24:54 PM (31202):
I had something similar happen to me.  I was very careful in my resets,  Just wanted to reset my nanoskills.  I took points from less needed skills and put them into my 3 main nano skills.  After being totally satisfied with the changes, I clicked accept, and put all my stuff back on .  When I zoned out, I was horrified that NO points had shown up in ONE of my skills. No points at all .  The IP points were gone, but the skill sat at only the amount that my implants raised it.   I spoke to an  ARk, then a GM  , who asked me to send in a bug report.  Someone from Funcom responded ,  saying it would be submitted as a bug.  

I do understand why they cant give me my points back , but still ..it makes life a bit more complicated now.

Devis @ 6/26/2002 11:35:28 PM (31202):
I have to agree with Lord Maxwell on this, everyone looks for a way to cheat the system. I also feel bad for Manha, my client suffers from a "visual bug" as well, my ranged enregy is listed 10pnts lower on the server then it shows on my client .. and well I never woulda noticed until I tried to equip a wen wen yesterday .. but there is only so much they can do. I know .. it sux. So they can't give you any ipr points or a total reset .. so lets look at your options. Re-roll, Quit, or trudge your way to 150 (I believe you get 2-4 ipr points) I know its not as much as you may need .. but it should help .. pluss once you hit the title cap at lvl 130  you have more ip then you know what to do with. If your on rk2 and are a clanner .. send me a tell .. I can trudge ya through a few missions with some of my friends that feel yoru pain.
what ever you decide .. goodluck to you.

Ditka @ 6/27/2002 1:14:30 AM (26055):
I'd like to thank everyone for thier support, it really has meant a lot to me.

I wish Cosmik would have ever bothered to talk to me about this.

Its all irrelevenant now.  The direction FC is taking the game (level req nanos) is not one that I am intrested in playing.  I will be leaving soon.

Thanks again all.  Hope to see you in Citizen Zero or SWG.

Funcom,

With more and more people getting hit by the "visual" bug while doing IPR and having their characters gimped beyond hope....

U are actually driving customers away.

Please, to prevent more victims, do post a warning message in your login launcher splash screen.

That is the least u could do to help the player community.

And if possible... give the victims a time line for a possible fix to those who got hit by this terrible bug.

-A concerned CUSTOMER.

Shashie @ 6/27/2002 5:28:28 AM (The Magical Toe Ring 33899):
Anyone else noticed something wierd with the toe ring?

The other day, when I was organizing the bank, I found a toe ring, and just out of curiosity, I put it into the feet slot, but nothing happened visually, so I put the old steel ribbed boots back on. The amazing thing was, after a few shuffles between the toe ring, the steel rib boots, and another pair of omni elite boots, somehow I ended up having the elite boots equipped in one of the ring slots, and the other boot in the original feet slot.

Just though it was interesting, wont make much of a difference anyway if you have 2 boots equiped

If the logs don't show it they can't do anything, a "nice" policy would be exploited to no end.

If you honestly don't think it will then just think back to the Alvin/Dodga mission pre patch. The people who ganked and ganked, do you think they wouldn't take the opportunity to lie to Funcom if they had a "nice" refund policy? 
			
		
	

Thing is that the log SHOULD show it.

It's the very same thing with Melee specials, Brawl/Fast Attack

Vydas @ 6/27/2002 12:46:13 PM (31334):
How about this for just a novel approach to things:  instead of asking for all things to be equally bad, ask for all things to be equally good.

Everyone gravitates to a few weapons choices in this game because there is not a wide variety of decent weapons dealing decent damage.

The solution to that particular problem might well lie in improving the existing weapons and introducing other practical choices, rather than reducing them all to garbage.

Just a slightly different approach.

Taldrin @ 6/27/2002 1:44:28 PM (Mob distribution in outside zones 33980):
I'm sure many of us have wandered along the edge of a zone at some point and seen the insane amount of mobs that can accumulate there. I highly doubt this is intended, with the interior of zones containing very few mobs except at specific sites, and on the perimeter having 99% of the total mobs in the zone. Is this a bug? Should there be even distribution throughout a zone? Is it getting looked into at all?

Here's a screen of one such area in TLR, I could post many more from many different zones, but for now this one shot illustrates what is happening quite well.

cryos1999 @ 6/27/2002 4:55:15 PM (31202):
I do agree with lord on this. If FC accepted a "nice" policy then everyone who used all there IP resets would say the exact same thing. 

 I have no reason to trust or mistrust you're words. Then again neither does FC.

Nullifax @ 6/27/2002 5:36:39 PM (Hideous new bug introduced in 14.4!! 34087):
There is a HUGE bug in 14.4

All the new nanos have level reqs.

Oberan @ 6/27/2002 6:25:42 PM (Wen-Wen ranged or melee weapon 34102):
ok the current wen wen uses ranged energy

BUT it checks vs evade clsc and has a multi melee requirement (not to mention the low range). Doesn't this mean it is supposed to require melee energy to equip not ranged energy???

Likewise consider this is very similar to the breathing space

The breathing space used to be ranged energy but was changed to its current form of melee energy

So which is it funcom. Is the wen-wen supposed to be ranged energy or melee energy?

Its obvious that its wrong in one way or another.

Snuble @ 6/27/2002 9:09:17 PM (32791):
Okay... 14.4 is here, and still no Wailing Wastes map in shop.

So I ask a GM, got the answer that its random mission loot... Well... Then what is the name of that map??? It can't be "Map of Wailing Wastes" cause that is not in the DB :/ 

Anyone?

labrutte @ 6/27/2002 9:25:29 PM (31334):

Magnuz @ 6/28/2002 2:28:17 AM (14.4 Bugs 34259):
Installed 14.4 patch today, and logged on with a big smile on my face. Found a team and started playing, when we were at 80% complete one teammember use the lift down to heal, but he got killed by fall damage (hit 4-6 times with 267 in damage). This player was the mission holder, and he got so frustrated that he didnt come back, the rest of us wanted to try to kill the boss. But when we came to the boss liff, there were still 8% left, and with one very important char missing, and me with 1.2K from level, we didnt risk taking on the boss. So we headed back, all fully healed, and when me and another teamate took the lift down, both of us got killed by fall damage, and of course i lost ALL xp (and with FC's fantasatic no reimbursement idea, even when bugs are to be blaimed....) i became a bit..... grumpy.   Didnt feel like trying another mission that day, so i just logged. Reported it to ARK's though, but what good do that do?  Discovered another bug to, activated surgery clinic, and rightclicked over an eye-implant (spot was empty on me) and it disappeared from inventory, but didnt appear at the implant spot. I rezoned, but still it was missing, and now it was missing from my inventory too. Checked all my bags, bank,etc.. lots of cash right out the drain... Ohhhh, and let me guess.. no reimbursement......

I can understand that player made faults should never be reimbursed, but bugs from FC's side should be. (at least that should prevent FC from making an emergency patch the day after a patch      )

Shinoko @ 6/28/2002 1:23:50 PM (34259):
yeah i was doing a team mission with a person in my guild and he was attacked by 267 points of fall damage 8 times and died

theres a bug that makes the mobs in team missions invisible if you loose sight of them...i was the puller and several times i couldnt attack the mob b/c it was in invisible to me, i'd go back to where i last saw it and i only say its selected name floating in air while my team is killing it in the first room  and one time i was the only one able to see the mob so they all kept buffing me and healing me

there are times when my yalm is equiped but im still running arround unmorphed....ususally happens when i leave a shop

when will FC fix the nano uploading bug, if you alread have the program and right click it the crystal will dissapear....many times ive done this accidently, why cant it just stay in the inventory??

the hp bars on the team list are still bugged

Paulie Walnuts @ 6/28/2002 2:55:28 PM (Full IPR gimped my HP!! 34426):
*** Funcom Developers please read this sad story ***

What I did earlier this week with my lvl 94 nanomage MP:

Before full IPR:

Stamina: 237
Body Dev: 313
HP: 1282/1282

After full IPR:

Stamina: 321
Body Dev: 410
HP: 1950/1282

So after seeing the 1950/1282 HP, I was thinking, ok, I'll zone and it'll then show 1950/1950 HP, which is correct with my new stats.  I zoned out from the shop into Tir and BAM: 1282/1282 HP.  I petitioned and talked to GM and he seems to think this is a 'visual client bug'; either way, I'm extrememly frustrated with this issue and this needs to be fixed asap.  As far as I am concerned, the full IPR did not work as designed and as a result, my character is now gimped by almost 700HP.  Please help me, Funcom!!!

Sincerely,
-Haggin, gimped lvl 94 nanomage MP on RK1

Lyriam @ 6/28/2002 3:45:25 PM (Team Missions "elevators" = double death 34458):
Happened to me twice today (after 14.4 kicked in thus) : i died at the very end of a team mission (one solo and one teamed) when taking the "elevator"

1 st one : we cleared most of the boss room, going up and down. I go back in the room, swing a few punches and get hit twice critically by the boss and i click on the arrow to get my little MA rear out of the room. I appear in the safety of the room beneath it..and there take 388 + 469 points of fall damage and die. I was like "wtf". Anyway i'm low level so it didnt really matter

2nd one, nearly same scenario despite the fact that it was a solo team mission. After clearing the ground floor, i'm full health when i clicked the "up" arrow to get to the upper floor. I have the time to hit Q and engage the combat with the mob waiting for me in that room, then take 300ish + 300ish points of fall damage and die again (FALL damage when you go up???)

Well, anyway, just to let you know. If you guys could check this out...i fear elevators now

Scarlito @ 6/28/2002 4:30:56 PM (30465):
Same problem happened to me multiple times, always in cave missions. No item. Sucks when you're aware you just wasted 1h cleaning the whole place from mobs just to discover you're ****ed up.

rhyztaz0 @ 6/28/2002 4:47:18 PM (34249):
I beleive what your talking about is a clan soldier school. Myself and some guildmates went in there and found a classroom type room set up with all the chairs and desks etc. Not sure what Its their for but we didnt get any special loot or anything, but it was a funny sight.

Nullifax @ 6/28/2002 5:00:00 PM (34343):
It breaks roots and snares when cast on yourself.  Same as the way Crats, Traders, and NTs can mezz themselves to do that.

kagemusha @ 6/28/2002 5:45:30 PM (Uninvited Mission Visitor 34510):
This is by far the weirdest bug I have ever come across. I was running a solo mission a ways out in Stret West Bank with my lvl 57 MA, and I was about 75% complete when I see an immediate area chat message saying "hello." (Previously I had noticed a floating white dot between walls, but could not spot anything) so this mysterious floating white dot shows up behind me in the form of a lvl 6 omni MA. 

So, I gather myself back together, and ask him how he got in. "front door." I petition, but I already knew that was futile. what's an ARK gonna say? "Wow, that some whacked out bug <port lvl 6 omni>" I tell the wee one to stay close and not get hurt unless he ~wants~ to leave. He  decides to stay close, and a mob spits on him and he's toast. That's pretty much the end of that, little guy gone, and he's extremely apologetic for some reason ::shrug:: I'm not really sure if it's possible that he braved the mobs around the mission area to be able to get there. 

Is it possible that the uniqueness of my mission key was not so unique?

FireC @ 6/28/2002 6:15:42 PM (34510):
I know there has been things like this hapening, as far as I remember very rarely and long long time ago - two people in the same solo mission by accident. Did you make a bug report? If this thing is happening again it's not at all good.

kagemusha @ 6/28/2002 6:20:57 PM (34510):
Will have to report the bug tonight. It is indeed not good

Vydas @ 6/28/2002 6:50:20 PM (34510):

Found the item in that type of mission under the water once, in the largish room with the pool that wraps around to the right - where the mobs used to get stuck swimming.

Bummed me out because I couldn't get to it.

Scrappy @ 6/29/2002 7:47:30 AM (Can't use Insurance Terminal 34658):
When I try to use an Insurance Terminal to save, it says I have items in Reclaim that must be claimed first.  So I go look and there is one NoName item in the Reclaim.  I take it, and still the Insurance term won't work.  In fact, every time I look in Reclaim there is one NoName item in there.  I can fill my inventory with them.  They all disappear when I change zones.

For the record, I haven't seen any other NoName items yet, and I definitely did NOT have the 99% patching problem.  Also, I can't remember the last time I died, it's probably been months (I played other characters while waiting for the Fixer-love patch.)

Anyone else seen this?  Any solutions?

Hi, just popped to arena to see what was going on, saw a 114ish trader there fighting, well turned into a brawl really, lots of people attacking him, his hp hit 0 and stayed on 0, he ran off, everyone chased him, he healed went back down to 0, this lasted 5 minutes, with people 30 lvls higher than him fighting him.

There where plenty of other people who saw this happen, Im not naming names but this needs fixing, clear and simple  , this is the worst kind of exploit.

Scrappy @ 6/29/2002 10:57:06 PM (34658):
FYI,
An ARK was kind enough to quickly respond to my petition and guide me to an easy fix.  Instead of trying to remove the NoName item from the Reclaim, delete it in-place.  It won't go away, but close the Reclaim bin and you're all set.  The Reclaim bin will be empty (i.e. won't re-open), and you should be able to save as normal.

Saw this too, I put 1000's of damage into him after he hit 0 points...he just wouldn't drop. It may be a bug, but if peeps figure out how to make it happen, then it's an exploit.

CrimsonSaint @ 6/30/2002 11:10:46 AM (26055):
Well we have already gotten the "I will look into it." and the "It appears to be working correctly." why more could you ask for? If you think this dilema of a "cold and uncaring" staff is central to Anarchy Online...you are mistaken. I have been nailed with bugs in just about every online game I have played and 98% of the time, even when I supply proof I get the industry standard "I'll look into it." "It appears to be working as intended, next!"

Suck it up and get over it, or walk away, those are your only options. This whole "Change my name." "Acknowledge the bug." "Fix it." crap is all out of line. Yeah it sucks when it happens but it happens, but that comes with the territory. I have played just about every MMORPG out their and sooner or later the though crosses my mind that I am paying to Beta Test, but it dosen't really matter to me as long as I am having fun. If you are looking for a finished flawless product you will never find it in a MMORPG because they are constantly changing and evolving, and often enough the scope is so vast that if you fix one thing it breaks three other things, or creates an exploit, imbalance and so on and so forth. 

So yeah

What you fail to understand is that this is not an isolated problem  After startign this thread I've spoken to LOTS of people in game who have the exact same issue.  Theres no chance in hell that FC is unaware of it, but rather than admit to anyone that the insurance scanners just dont work sometimes, they ignore myself and everyone else who has gotten uppity about it.  This thread was not an attempt to gain reslolution, it was an attempt to highten awarness.

Before 14.4 I was 50% succesful if I wasn't recharging from a nanorecharger. Then it would always fail. I think this might apply to other shieldgrafts too. Had the same problems earlier with a reflect-shield graft. Don't that it now.

Tritoshe @ 7/1/2002 9:43:59 AM (crash during team mission + relog = death 35110):
Hi,

Yesterday, I had a very bad experience (this is only the second time I am really fed up with bugs in this good game) with team missions. We were 6 players in a team mission and everyhing was fine except that:
- the mission was very very long (too long, this is my first complain; afer 1 or 1,5 hour we were still at 70%); it looks like there were around 100 mobs! The map was so huge that we spent a lot of time clearing all floors
- as a consequence to the first remark, at a moment we got lost when we retrieved an unlucky player who re-joined the team after diconnection. We were all running everywhere to find these elevators: why not putting elevator switchs in the map when they are discovered?????
- as a consequence to the second remark (this is my explanation) I was kicked out AO: strange, i got the usual exit screen (freeing memory) and then I got the login screen (although the first instance of AO was not completly closed????). It seems that also another player had the same problem; I do not know about others.
- the last thing, very very boring: I re-logged, and I appeared in the team mission, BUT FULL OF MOBS (althought before crash we were more than 78% completetion!). Of course I died after a few seconds and LOST 133k exp!

My conclusion is the following:
- limit the maximum size of the map and number of mobs (or at least give the possibility to change this as a setting of the mission)
- indicate the elevator switchs when they are discovered on the map
- DO NOT save the location of the players when they exit/crash in the mission. PUT THEM AT THE ENTRANCE OR OUTSIDE!

A few minor problems, still annoying:
- pet pathing! this is crazy how many times my pet was stuck in the middle of a table (how an elevator can end up in a small room with a table in the corner?). AO is may be 1 year old, and I was not there at the beginning, but I suppose pets were. So this is definitivly something that should have been fixed/investigated a long long time ago!

When you get your stuff from reclaim, if you crash, you loose all your inventory. Rather rare, but it happens. And FC don't reimburse anything .... even in that case.

This is a known problem. The server your mission was on crashed. And instead of a periodic save so that they can roll back to that save after crashing (probably to reduce server load) it has to rebuild the mission from scratch. If you are more then 3 rooms from the entrance that usually kills you (unless you can calm)

Should be 'When you get your stuff from reclaim, if Foncom's server crashes...'

Check out Lost Items - Revisited  thread (plus others) - and it's not as rare as you think...

Regards, Eta

PS - You'll feel much much better after reading this...

Quote start: “Let me try to explain to you why we are unable to 
reimburse your loss. 

Right now we don’t have the tools for doing this. In our databases data are stored as big clumps of data, so-called blobs. Since all the data is packed in these blobs it is very difficult and sometimes impossible for us to track items. 

One of the highest priorities for the AO Live Team right now is to 
restructure out data and make it possible for us to track items, and by having this possibility we will also be able to verify someone’s loss of an item and be able to reimburse it. 

We are very sorry about the situation as it is today, and we know that reimbursals will be a very wanted feature by everyone, maybe the people who want it the most is the GM's. Please understand that this is something we will see shortly in the game, and again, I am sorry for your loss.” Quote end!

I asked the development team today how fare they had come with the reimbursement tool and the answer was that if we are really lucky we will have it in the game shortly after the summer holidays.

One thing that is important to remember is that this tool must work very well in order for us in Customer Service to be able to give you back what you rightfully lost. So the test period will be intense, and we will not launch it before we are absolutely certain in works as intended.

One other important thing to know is that items lost before we actually patch the new logging system onto the servers will not be logged and therefore not reimbursed. Only items lost after the new logging system will be reimbursed.

This turned out to be a long answer to you, but I think you deserve a thorough answer to your question. I know a long answer can’t make up for your loss, but I hope it can make you confident that we are doing all we can to improve our customer service.

Mollie @ 7/1/2002 1:33:43 PM (34458):
Can we get an ETA for a fix for this? Saying it's `high priority' (an ARK when I asked if it was ever going to be fixed) and putting a message warning low levels from doing team missions on the launcher is all well and good but right now I still can't do team missions with any chara under, say, 40 without playing Russian Roulette with the down buttons.

Dakxx @ 7/1/2002 10:16:15 PM (33754):
Well if thats the case then it should say you only get that, and not the full amount.  I don't see a problem with them givein gme that total amount just once for a quest, thats why quests are harder then others.

aiyen

Alynie @ 7/1/2002 10:51:36 PM (35206):
I'm not sure about the bug itself, but the solution to get past the "Better nanoprogram already running" message is to shoot the mob once, then cast your lower QL calm.  It's a crappy solution, though.

I get this problem all the time when I team with my NT buddy.  His calm is a higher QL than mine.  If I skill drain the mob, that breaks the calm, but apparently doesn't remove the calm from the mob's NCU.  So I can't use my own lower QL calm on the mob until I shoot it once.

Alynie @ 7/1/2002 10:53:47 PM (34343):
Hmm.. If you are using the mez to break roots and snares, I'd recommend using something else will a faster recharge time.

I get the message that false profession so and so will terminate in ten seconds and I wait, and wait for it to actually terminate. This gets really annoying in solo missions because I have to switch between enforcer and mp professions to even be able to complete 50% missions now. Not a game killer, but I waste valuable buff time sitting and waiting longer than should be needed. Anyone else having this problem?

Plz plz plz help!

Thanks for listening!

Tritoshe @ 7/2/2002 8:52:54 AM (35110):
Hey,

This is really a stupid bug then. If the server does not save the status of the mission, why the hell does it makes you log in the middle of it after rebuilding the complete map with mobs?

Damn, and this is a known problem :-(

Leosonyc

Vydas @ 7/2/2002 1:11:07 PM (35315):
It's not an FP nano bug, because this will also happen with other things, like adventurer morphs.  To be honest, it seems to happen to all 'buffs', but it's more annoying for FP and morphs, due to the nature of refreshing.  It's a timing and synch issue, though, and not really a bug with FP.  Just one of the many cases where what the client thinks and what the server thinks are not the same for a significant period of time.

Nullifax @ 7/2/2002 2:32:52 PM (34343):
Other hostile nanos don't work because they put a little bandaid in the code which prevents "hostile" nanos from breaking roots and snares during combat.  However, they forgot to remove mezz from that list of "hostile" nanos.

Inocybe @ 7/2/2002 4:32:13 PM (Problem with Fixer Quest - Baboons 35458):
I first posted my problem at the Fixer prof board (others have also posted) 
http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sho...threadid=35144
but someone suggested posting it here as it is a techincal problem. 

------------

My Fixer cannot complete the quest because the cursor/accept button action is unresponsive and hence trade cannot be done in that place - Baboons just sends my game into a tailspin. I don't have that problem in other bars like Rompa, The Cup, Reet Retreat, Dancing Atrox Bar, etc... only Baboons.

Remember how bad Baboons was during Beta? When a lot of people couldn't even make past the front door and they would just float up? Although something has been to alleviate the situation since then, that place remains a nightmare for many players.

And I have met other Fixers who are stuck at the same step of the quest - Dancing Fool and Baboons. The common thing - we don't have high-end systems. I can't believe something like this slipped testing stage 

Please have a heart and move that Dancing Fool somewhere else. Rompa or the Dancing Atrox Bar or somewhere, anywhere but Baboons.

Afterthought ...
I don't know how long it might take to look into Baboons but please consider re-locating the Dancing Fool for the time being? 
Also, in that thread at the Fixer prof board, others have reported problems even though they have higher systems than mine.  In my case, I'm one of those that have problems moving about freely in Baboons. I have to switch to walk mode while I am in Baboons. It also takes me a long time to go up those stairs, far too long that it will never meet the quest timer - I had to ask an engineer friend to warp my fixer up to the balcony.  The trading part  however is the huge problem.

Hmm personally I only use it after fight over (and mez because it has no negative side effects for players).

				The adventurers have gotten new deflection shield items usable only by them, which recycle faster than the normal ones. They have also received a "Flurry of Blows" look-alike item that recycles quicker. These are found in various places, and can be produced through trade-skill processes by kind friends of the Adventurer.
			
		
	
Many Adventure Shield found various places, but no-adventure-version-flurry found yet.
So there is any loot table bug or something.
And I tryed all shop selling trade skill tool to shield and flurry both.
Found Neutron Displacer change normal shield to adventure shield, but couldn't find way to change flurry to any adventure version flurry.

check loot table and trade skill way both please.

+ there is no normal poison deflection shield on db.
Is that bug or designed for ?
Adv version poison shield is there and many ppl looted it.

When someone hides successfully, I cannot target that person, not even by pressing F2 while teaming with them.  That's fine.

But if I select them, do a /follow, and he THEN hides, I follow him wherever he goes. That's not fine.
If I can not see him, why can I still follow him?  /follow should be broken when a successful sneak has been made.

Or am I totally wrong on this? Anyone else noticed?

This upsets me.  After doing a mission, saving in at least three different places.  Two to three days later I die trying to solo Trash King Lacky and I lose 2 mil xp.

I am 100% certain I saved, heck I saved in three different places.  I never saw that text string: You are unbale scan with items still in your reclaim" or something close to that.

I do another mission, make positive I save, two days later Live Metal killed me, and I lose 3.8 mil xp.  Each time I died I ended up in Broken Shores, and I have not been to broken Shores for a week.

My bet is that she's following the guide on our website www.mockers.net so it's not likely she's missed a step. 

The problem is that the lag in Baboons is so horrible that it makes it difficult to get up the spiral staircase to the balcony where the Dancing Fool is. Once you get up there, you have mouse lag, etc and it can be difficult to get through the trade process with the npc.

Hi,

I want to also support Chown!
The situation starts to scare me; I have been affected by the bug until now, but the same thing happened last week during a team mission. We were in team and we all saved in Varmind Woods, but we had an unlucky adventurer that ended up in Tir when he died during the mission. At this time nobody really realized the problem.
But now, I am scared! If this kind of very very basic functionality does not work 100% as it should then AO becomes seriously bad in my eyes (when I am loosing xxx k EXP when I am dying I am already angry [against me not being prudent enough], but if it should happen because of one more stupid bug, then.......).

Jason-M @ 7/5/2002 6:45:17 AM (Self-cast, unbuffed bot acting like it's OE'd... 36166):
Yes yes yes, I decided to make myself a little neut 'crat today. I went to the store and happily bought a nice little bot to follow me around at level 3. I cast the guy, went into a mission, and told him to attack a baddy...

Only problem was that he said, "Are you my master?"

I checked my spacetime and mattercreate, made sure it was all in order... yup, both at 22, just like the nano requires. So, I zoned. I typed in /pet guard, but to no avail. I then decided ot kill this pet, since he was a naughty little oaf, and it so happened that my next bot was a reincarnation of my first one. In fact, every bot I have made seems to have the rebellious spirit my first bot had.

So, I decided to log off. "Surely, that will solve it!" I though to myself. Unfortunently, no. It seems the soul of that first bot which I summoned will haunt me forever. Or until a GM fixes it. (Which is pretty close to the same amount of time...)

Sooo, that's my bug. Fix it, now dangit! NOW!

Sean-Roach @ 7/5/2002 9:14:59 AM (34510):
I'm thinking the little guy had an old mission key.  One to a zone number that the server had recycled, but one to a zone door that he could reach.

I've been known to re-log after a mission had timed out, (I had to go to work, or some-such), and find that, since I camped in the mission area, I was still in the mission area.  I've even noticed that I could still have a key, and presumably let myself back in, when I camped outside.

Of course, this was 6-9 months ago.  I don't know if I could still do that.

Also, this is purely speculation.

Sean-Roach @ 7/5/2002 9:18:30 AM (35968):
Today, (yesterday, it's after midnight), I managed to walk, I assume, into a corner, and get stuck in a mission.  Thank you again to the ARK who got me unstuck.  I forgot your name, sorry.

I think FunCom should make the walls permeable from the backside.  This would not only mean fewer lost pets, but no more getting wedged between the walls, as characters could just walk back through the wall.

Kynu @ 7/5/2002 5:05:57 PM (Pseudo Death 36251):
This happened to me five times in the past three days, once while soloing, four times while in team.

While in a seperate room from the fighting, I received a barrage of attacks from the mob that equaled to my full hitpoints.  In all cases, the agro was held either by my pets or by my teammate in an entirely different area and there were no adds.  Somehow I was able to crawl around with 0-10 hitpoints, but when targeted by a teammate, I had full hitpoints.  I was also unable to use a treatment kit, my healing pet, or the 15 point healing nano.  While in teams, I just zoned out to find myself with full hitpoints and everything was fine.  When I was soloing, the mob killed my attack pet, and promptly killed me.  It sucked.

Inocybe @ 7/5/2002 5:47:49 PM (35458):
Yes of course we have tried but for some of us, it won't still wont work  

And if it's not a trade problem, it's the stairs problem - what ever it is,  Baboons is causing problems for some of us. Hence the suggestion/plea to move that quest NPC.

WHAT IS UP???????

Tal Cerav @ 7/6/2002 2:30:51 AM (35458):
I drop to about 2 fps in Baboon's, and after navigating the spiral staircase (not easy... walking helped) I was unable to accept the trade.  

As to it not being a technical problem, I believe it is.  When the fps drops, left click becomes inopperable.  I was also unable to open any of my status windows (i.e. the mission window, team window, etc. ) by left clicking on the buttons atop the play window.   I could not close any information windows by clicking their close button.  I could not decline the trade with the dancing fool by left clicking decline either.  

These same problems crop up in the static mission in Longest Road.  The big rooms cause them, and it gets even worse when someone opens a door up between the big room I'm in and another big room.  When I go to the little bathrooms in the back of Baboon's, the problems cease.  Now, if only the Fool would do his dancing in the bathrooms...  

My system is a 466 Mhz, 512 Mb Ram, 32 Mb Geforce 2.  It's above minimum reqs.  However, this quest is uncompleteable in it's current format.  I minimized every graphics setting under options, and tried running it in 640x480 even.  No luck.

Stratah @ 7/6/2002 3:42:04 AM (36349):
If it's in the inventory of, or equipped on any player, in any way, it decays as it is intended to.

What may be causing your confusion is that the decay rate of some summoned items has been dramatically increased recently.

				The items summoned with the "Smuggler's Shipment", "Bootleg Blades'n Blunts" and "Bootlet Beamers'n Bolters" will now exist for 12 hours, rather than two. Additionally, the credit cost of summoning these items has been lowered dramatically.

I managed to do the quest. I don't get any lag in baboons but that spiral starcase is hard to ascend at certain turns. I found stepping back then going forward got me up it. Perhaps FC could extend or remove the timer on that part, or move the grrovy atrox to the 'green room' behind the DJ?

Not real shure if it's a bug or just a useless item.

A treatment library of QL 5 gives:
- First Aid + 1
- Treatment +2

So exactly why does a QL 30 version give only:
- First Aid +3
- Treatment +4

Aparently from what friends tell me the list gets considerably more rediculous as the QL goes up.

Granted i wasnt expecting them to give out tremendous increases when i assembled them but everione has to admit that it's kind of pointless.

So. Is it a bug or just useless ?

Tyndel @ 7/7/2002 8:30:57 PM (New bug with calm and outdoor mobs 36646):
Out playing with shades today, and calmed a few that came charging in on me.   Now, before, the outdoors mobs that attacked you(ran towards you) when you calmed, would keep following you around(would seem so in the client, the server would keep track of them as standing still).. they dont do that anymore, and that is good.
However, now, if you have your bots break calm, they oddly enough follow you after the calm is broken. And this seems to be happening serverside too. So basically.. what happens to me is this.. 
Mob charges me, i calm it. then my pets finish off the current mob they are fighting, and i walk away from the calmed pet, and send pets on that one.  Then the calmed mob at once starts running towards me(while fighting my pets) and runs straight up to me, and stays there, fighting my pets.  If i walk around.. the mob follows me.
Now this is REALLY annoying, cause when fighting melee mobs, they have a WAY higher chance to switch to you if you are actually in range to hit at, also, i dont like having a fight happen 0.2 cm from my viewscreen.. i like to see whats going on.

So please get this fixed. 

(This happened to me in GTC, fighting shades up in the desert there. And it happened to me 5-6 times, every time i calmed adds and sent pets on it.)

Swing @ 7/8/2002 1:02:41 AM (36166):
Oddly enough, I had a n00b crat come to me with the same problem, about a week ago.  After buffing her, debuffing her, and going so far as building a set of implants so we could =really= OE the bot, I threw up my hands, bought her the next pet, and told her to level before uploading it.  Sure enough, this fixed the problem

Engies and MPs dont have to buy thier first pet.  And it seems that only crats are affected by this annoyance..  The only conclusion I can draw is that the basic worker-droid crystal is bugged.  Yay.

Then yesterday, when I was picking a teammission, I cheked the reward items on several of the missions. And some of em gave 6 AoPM. Some gave just a heap of the same type of gun. Then I tried singleplayer missions, and managed to get all 5 missions 3 times in a row giving Anima of Pure Malevolence. ok BOORING. I want to find something else.

Swahili @ 7/9/2002 9:50:31 PM (Fix The 0-HP/Non-Death Bug! 37179):
When someone hits zero hitpoints, they should die. None of this getting up stuff, no more capacity to take additional damage, no ability to run off and recover. You should die. Period. And it should be a standard AO death in that it takes just a second too long and is overly dramatic. It's one of those fundamental principles, right? 

Whatever the case, I've been hearing about this recent bug/exploit wherein you don't die upon hitting 0 HP. Rather, you just sort of fight on, taking unlimited damage in the process. I'd read about it in numerous threads in these forums, I'd heard accounts from guildmates, but I'd never seen it until last night. Yep, some few hours ago in Camelot, I got to see this bug/exploit/display of uberness in action. I went, I saw, I took screenies, I laughed about it. I assumed it was just another silly bug, the kind we've all grown used to. I even joked about it in this very forum, as you can read in http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sh...threadid=37131. 

Alas, just moments ago, I came across a lowly level 90 MA soloing multiple 150+ Cyborgs at once. He had no hitpoints yet somehow managed to fight on, racking up XP all the while. Funny. I get within 40m of any of those same borgs and am suddenly at 70%, yet here is this one single Clanner making me look like a gimp! I mean, I know I'm a gimp next to most MA's, but they're usually my level and quite experienced. No, no. This was an exploit, plain and simple. 

Now, I don't care what you personally may or may not want to call this 0-HP non-death situation. What I saw last night with Nubs, well, I chalked it off to the bug category. But what I witnessed moments ago, that was exploiting. Call it what you will, this needs to be fixed. 

As it is, it is starting to seem that AO is having some serious issues retaining people. Or have none of you noticed all the high level farewells from the last two weeks?? This stuff right here, this exploiting, this will kill AO in no time at all. Why should anyone PVP when there is the chance that some foolio isn't going to die, even when he gets down to zero hitpoints?? What's the value in anyone obtaining 200 when someone else can go solo multiple medusas at level 100 and bypass all the hard work in a matter of a couple weeks?? 

Funcom, I am still enjoying AO despite all my complaints. I have no intention of leaving it until the bitter end, but this is pathetic and you all really need to figure out what is happening and then you need to fix it. 

As for you Lost Chapter guys, well, I know some of you are probably innocents in all this, but I trust you know the saying about a couple bad apples spoiling the bunch.

Docmax @ 7/9/2002 10:06:37 PM (4 sec server lag every 2 minutes 37181):
About 32 days ago on a Friday, there was a message in the server status area on the logon screen that read something like
"the servers are all messed up and we don't know why, we're looking into it" 

The message ran all weekend long.  The problem that started that Friday is still in the game 32 days later.  About every 2 minutes or so, the servers shutdown for 3 to 8 seconds and no one can cast, sit, or fight.  You notice it most if you are a casting profession, like a doctor.  Everyone in the team (and in guild chat's) will say "lag" so I know it's not just me.

If you are not a casting profession, you may not notice it at all.

It's very annoying and it didn't used to be there.  

Please explain and fix this one, it gives me a sick to my stomach feeling, like an experience-hickup.  Very ugly.

Shyenia @ 7/9/2002 10:12:35 PM (37181):
Buddy your not alone!!!

Ex. 1 -
 About a week ago last weekend my Organization buddies and I are in a huge mission 70-80 team in a 127 mission. We go up on the lift to the 3rd floor and all of a sudden we cannot sit, cast heal, etc. for a total of 10-15 mins. Low and behold the servers catch up and all of a sudden I get hugely spammed with a bajillion spells and people running around... Very funny

Ex.2 - 
 Last night im blitzing missions and on the way out with my item I get a$$ raped by the FC server. This mission had nothing but chaos minions in the damn thing and im level 80. Just as I hit the exit door the server catches up with my client and warps me back to main room where 5 or 6 chaos minions are sitting at the dinner table with chemical plates waiting for my tasty wolf self.

So yes the servers are F.U.B.A.R 'ed!!

Glarawyn @ 7/9/2002 11:11:03 PM (Support Beam Bug 37195):
Found a Quality Support Beam in a mission last night (Ql120) Took a good look at it, and noticed something. 

The defence skill for the support beam is listed as Duck. 

The description for the Duck/Explosions skill is for defence agnist trown weapons and explosions (gernades) 

So, Support beams aren't thrown, and they definitly don't explode, so why is duck the defence skill?!? Seems like it should evade clsc like other 1he and 2he weapons. 

I based my defence skills off the descriptions so this really annoys me! My close combat and dodge range skills are high, but my duck is 1/3 of that since throwing weapons aren't in the game, and I have never seen anyone using gernade weapons. This worked well for me until I tried to PVP with a beam toting enforcer! 

So can this be fixed, or can we at least get an explination as to why it's Duck not Evade? And if the explination is "We goofed," please follow that with "We'll fix it!"

Jayde @ 7/9/2002 11:55:08 PM (37179):
I DON'T want them to fix it in the way your suggest. Why? Because it (typically) is a result of LAG.

Every time it has happened to me, it has been because I have zoned, however the server still held me in the zone even after I was "changing areas" and I got hammered by 4 or 5 hits while in limbo. I DON'T WANT THIS TO KILL ME.

AO has enough lag deaths as it is, let alone making this one work "as intended." If you want a real fix, make sure those phantom hits don't happen, and you'll never see it.

Also, you exaddurate the ability to exploit this glitch. First off, the most any monster can give is 10% XP. Meaning, in the best case scenario, you have to kill 10 enemies to level. Now, I have seen situations where people could freely attack MOBs without worry of dying. I have seen people get into positions where the ICC guards couldn't attack back, and the Enhanced Shark in Athen is another good example. I watched a level 112 soldier with crit buffs take almost 20 minutes to kill one of the level 190-200 Female High Commanders in ICC.

Even if they DID give XP, 10-20 minutes for 10% XP is not a good deal at all. Take a good team into a hard team mission, and you will level MUCH faster. I gained 3 levels in just over an hour (along with 12 other people--so a combined 36 levels worth of XP spread around) with a good pair of teams taking a 200-man high-level mission. There is no way someone could solo a super-hard mob that quickly to gain XP, even if they did have infinite HP.

There are much more effective ways to power-level, as well. And very few involve anything remotely considered an "exploit."

Tahrus @ 7/10/2002 12:16:26 AM (Fix The Waterfall!!! 37203):
Hey!  One of the coolest things I have seen in my short AO lifetime is BROKEN!!!

The Waterfall in Aegean(The New Road) has a secret passage behind it, which leads up to a small village on a mountain-top(the same village Dodga is in).  But instead of going through the waterfall into the secret passage...we SWIM UP THE WATERFALL!  now before 14.4 the passage worked correctly.

also there is a building in that village which is broken.  If you try to go in, you get the message "Server could not start the building" and then a bunch of technical mumbo-jumbo.

but that's a minor thing. the main thing is FIX THE WATERFALL!!! PLEASE!!

Finfarin @ 7/10/2002 1:11:39 AM (26055):
This may not be related but it sounds almost along the same lines, so heres what I've seen. 

For the past 2 days Ive been in the process of reequiping my soldier (since i did a IP reset on him). I had a bunch of old equipment  weapons armor etc etc. Went through various stores in omni trade looking for new equip and i sold off the old junk. A friend messaged me and needed me to buff him with one of my alts so i loged out and loged back in with one of my other characters. After i buffed him I relogged in my soldier ...the stuff i had sold at the terminal was back. I resold it again in a different store thinking that i may have hit cancel accidentally, went on to the next shop...low and behold all the junk was back in my backpack again. This happend like 3 times, almost like it didnt take  BUT the stuff that i bought and equiped was still with me. Seems to be something to do with zoning into the shops. Maybee they operate on a different server? and something is lost between the zoning? Kind of like saving at a city then zoning into a mission.. (From your posts this always seemed to happen when saving then going on missions?)I seem to remember reading somewhere that the mission zones run on a different server. Its almost like the info is being lost on their end between the different servers. 

I am on cable  the ping indicator was green and my ping was around 75 or so I was experiencing no lag.

If Cosmic went around testing the servers then terminating himself to see if it saved then there is no way possible that he would have seen the bug. I believe it has to do with saving then zoning into a mission area same as what was happening with the items in my backpack.

I seem to remember a few times too where i could have sworn i saved then ended up somewhere else even after seeing the character stored message. It never happend in places like broken shores where the save terminals were close to the missions, it always seemed to happen when I would save in one zone travel to another for a mission then end up where i saved the night before when i died.

Just my 2 cents

Swahili @ 7/10/2002 2:15:48 AM (37179):
Thanks for the reply, Jayde.  Now, can you do me a favor and tell the handful of Clansman I came across in Mort today who were all soloing mobs well beyond their levels?  Nothing like an 80 Agent taking on a couple 160+ Mantises.  Fortunately, he was kind enough not to kill me though he easily could have.  We laughed about it and went our different ways.

Karuna @ 7/10/2002 3:37:08 AM (37195):

Are the 3 to 8 second server lags every 2 to 4 minutes still there, too?

Nullifax @ 7/10/2002 7:48:39 PM (37179):
How about this:  stand in a cyborg camp with autoattack on and just walk away from your computer.  Watch a movie, eat dinner, have a few beers, come back a few hours later and suddenly you find you've gained like 20 levels.  Kinda nice if you ask me.

While we're at it, they should just have level terminals in the game.  These would be terminals where you click on them and they give you a level.  Or better yet, so you don't have to click so many times, just type in the number of levels you'd like to get and it gives it to you.  Yeah, that would make everything REALLY fun!

Seriously though, this is some bad mojo.

Dedori @ 7/10/2002 7:53:29 PM (Experience Rip Off 37379):
Soloed my way through a team mission today.  Killed every mob on every level.  Near the end I noticed I wasn't getting experience sometimes.

I'm aware of most of the experience rip off bugs...fighting multiple monsters...zoning after a kill..et tedious cetera...

But this time I was fighting a single mob at a time and never zoned or logged and I saw at least two times I got no experience and no increase in heroic effort percent...nor any death message at all for that matter.

At the end my heroic percentage was only 77% after killing all the mobs.  This would tend to indicate I was ripped off 23% of the time.

Now I know how broken AO is but I NEVER expected such a HUGE flaw in such a fundamental aspect of the game.

Nianna @ 7/10/2002 7:55:02 PM (Grid death bug 37380):
Dying in the grid by typing /terminate does not work properly.  I go through the death motion and it takes all my hit points, but I dont actually die.

My guess is that this means that when fixers get a DOT cast on them then they grid away from a pvp battle they dont die properly in the grid either.  That WAS supposed to be what the loss of all hps except one on fixer grid spells was for right?  Otherwise I dont really see how a fixer could ever die in PvP at high level since the 6 sec grid spell would be practically instant.

While soloing team missions I get no experience for killing monsters that SHOULD be giving me some.  No message...no token percent bump...nothing but a corpse to loot.

I killed everything in a team mission, all green and up, and ended up at 77% chance for token...so I figure I lost 23% of my experience for kills.  That's a LOT.

I talked to an ARK who stated it's the "price" of soloing team missions but I found that answer unacceptable and after some debate it was passed on to the bug team.

In any event, I think everyone should know about it and plan accordingly.

It seems like you had a brown cave mission and killed mobs who were standing in the green ooze.

Mobs standing in ooze while you kill them don't generate xp or token %

Dedori @ 7/11/2002 4:11:13 AM (37397):
But it happens in other missions too.

It's even been reported in non-team missions on some forums now.

Aristaeus @ 7/11/2002 6:13:08 AM (37397):
Hmm. There was a bug a while back that if damage shields killed a mob it wouldn't register either.

Lyriam @ 7/11/2002 9:02:23 AM (No token if not 100% chance - bug or bad luck?? 37504):
Since the 14.4 patch, i can only get a token if i clean 100% of the mission, i can even miss one single mob or i dont get it. I tracked a bit the last missions i did...sticked with not cleaning it all thinking it was bad luck but i dont think so...

Solo Team Miss QL 49 : 86% completion, no token
Miss QL 56 : 93% completion, no token
Miss QL 55 : 97% completion, no token
Solo Team Miss QL 50 : 89% completion, no token
Miss QL 55 : 91% completion, no token
Miss QL 54 : 96% completion, no token

Miss QL 53 : 100% completion, token ok
Solo Team Miss QL 52 : 100% completion, token ok

That is just the missions i wrote down starting to get frustrated not getting the tokens..i dont know how many before that were "no token" missions, but i assume at least 10 of them. I can understand the odds when you top at 50% chance..you got 1 chance out of 2 to get it..but above 80% or even 90%  chance, no token for AT LEAST 16 missions in a row doesnt seem only bad luck.

When my fixer friend tells me he got a token @ 1% completion just because he had to kill a mob while blitzing, i just wanna cry

Shyenia @ 7/11/2002 11:41:24 AM (37181):
Yessir,

The lag is still there even after two maintainence patches. I especially notice it during peak hours of 8pm-3am PST -8:00GMT
then it goes away almost to non-existence. This is probably due to most of the playing world going to bed for the next 3 or 4 hours. So if you want lag free time *if there is such a thing* best do it after 3am PST

Nullifax @ 7/11/2002 2:35:26 PM (37179):
If you don't get XP in this state, you could still try keeping your char camped at some rare aggroeing Unique for a while like the Tarrasque or something.  Or maybe you could go hang out at the Humungous Baraton.  So far that mob hasn't dropped anything worthwhile, but seeing as how I've never seen Plumbo drop anything, and Plumbo supposedly drops the rust-pitted ring, maybe Humungous drops something decent once every 100 or so kills.  Who knows, for all we know maybe he drops a QL 200 Juggernaut Maintenance Console (+40 treatment, goes in a wrist slot).

Hypos @ 7/11/2002 3:23:45 PM (37397):

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 8:26:57 PM (37181):
Weird...
Just had a couple problems yesterday, but a GM told me nothing was wrong.
I was in the middle of a battle when all of a sudden the server side stuff went dead.  I was still in client side for a few minutes, able to run around and wave to enemies but not interact with anything.  Then I dropped completely and came back to a ton of xp missing (I was near the end of a big mission ).
After that it seemed I was getting a lot of minor hits of lag.  Then the same as above happened again, luckily it was right after a fight this time.
The only other time I had crashed like this was when I first started, but it went away and I passed it off as a setting on my machine I had fixed...

Very annoying .

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 8:35:13 PM (37179):
Strange- this has happened once or twice to me, but I passed it off as an oddity and healed up.
Maybe this is a good spot to mention this- I passed off having 0 hp and being alive, because my total hp when completely healed tends to be 3 hp above my max hp.  Not sure why, but I guess I assumed it worked the other way too- since I was three above, I should actually die at -3 rather than 0.  Maybe it has to do with the number weirdness funcom has (weapons need +1 from the documented skill to equip, grid requres +1 from the actually required skill to use).  Has anyone else noticed that about their HP?

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 8:38:06 PM (37504):
I've noticed that the % chance doesn't seem to reflect reality as well, although on a much smaller sample.  Both me and an RL friend have hit 95% on a few missions and not gotten tokens.  I haven't dared go less than 100% lately because of that.  Glad to hear it's not just me .

Although you don't have to be at 100%, it just seems that if you're not, the % doesn't actually reflect your chances of getting a token.  A friend got a token at around 65% last night.

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 8:42:25 PM (37379):
I saw someone mention on another board (maybe it was in response to you- if so, sorry) that if you team with a neutral or opposite faction you can get enemies of your faction in the mission.  When by yourself killing them, you get no xp or token chance.

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 8:44:12 PM (37195):
Well, if someone's swinging something big and heavy at you...


DUCK!!!


Actually, I have no clue...  but it seems a number of things are weird like that.

Dhurdahl @ 7/11/2002 9:26:27 PM (37379):
Are you using cust reets by any chance?

If the mob is killed by the nano damage from them you wont get any xp.

Dosuchin @ 7/11/2002 9:31:16 PM (Help! 37625):
Today there were server bugs or something and it messed everyone up.  I kept trying to enter places and it wouldn't work.  So finally things got fixed (I think) and I somehow got transported in an area of Tir that I can't get out of.  All it is are walls and some doors I can enter through, but none of them lead out.  So I'm literally stuck and can't get out in any way.  I try logging off and back and I keep coming back to the same place.  What can I do?  Will I have to start a new character?  I hope not.  I just started this game Saturday and this isn't a good first impression on a "newbie".

Solinarus @ 7/11/2002 9:37:53 PM (37625):
That sounds weird...
Can you see anyone else there?
My first day, a RL friend got stuck on the wrong side of a zone- he could see where he was supposed to be, but wasn't actually there.
If that's what's going on, then do "/petition stuck <message>".  Usually they're quick with stuck-type messages.

Docmax @ 7/11/2002 10:45:12 PM (37181):
sounds like they may think it's not an issue

this is not good news

Dosuchin @ 7/11/2002 10:53:44 PM (37625):
I went log on again, and before the entire area finished loading I was able to run through a wall, basically.  So I got out.  I'm so relieved.

Vydas @ 7/12/2002 1:49:14 AM (37181):
I'm having this, too.  I just logged off, actually, because my lag is too bad to play.

It's noticeable when a morph or fp wears off, but you can't refresh because although your client thinks that the nano is no longer running, the server doesn't agree.

Leomorn @ 7/12/2002 3:02:53 AM (36843):
<Bumpity bump>

This thread must be bumped until FC either delete it or do something about these damn phantom deaths.

It just happened to us in the huge main room in a BS team mission. We had killed about 12 mobs straight off, were having a quick breather, when bam, 6 350-600 hits out of nowhere in complete silence. I am dead and the others wonder where the hell I've gone. 

As I'm making my way back from reclaim, another team mate suffers exactly the same fate.

Later in the mission it happens a third time, to another different player. Good night it's time to log...

P.S. When I get back to the main room my dead body is still there - is that supposed to happen? A bit morbid, if you ask me, seeing your own remains.

Tanuki @ 7/12/2002 5:01:21 AM (Stand up when swimming 37691):
While swimming forward, use a healing treatment ... you stand up, and then start floating across the top of the water like Jesus in the Bible or something. Haha!

This is actually a special case of a larger bug, I think, wherein you can perform certain movements while walking, and your player model freezes in a "stand still" position even though they are moving, so they appear to ice-skate/float forward rather than run or walk. Stopping your movement and restarting causes the character to go back into their animation.

It may only be a graphical bug, but it isn't limited to any one video card.

Magetsu @ 7/12/2002 5:46:18 AM (Whompa problems 37699):
every time i try to use any whompa or grid terminal to go to omni ent the game freezes and i am forced to ctrl+alt+del i have seen many players complaining of other whompa problems as well, please fix!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Evilspork @ 7/12/2002 7:14:04 AM (Random Bugs 37709):
I started writing this list up a couple weeks ago on a whim, adding entries when I remembered or noticed another bug. Here we go:

Many times I have run right through the zone border to the clan newbie area from the clan backyard and getting stuck, needing either ARK assistance or RDing out as a fixer. The zone border back to the backyard is screwy too, requiring you to take a step back from the invisible wall where you should have zoned.

Map in missions resets when you zone/crash/LD. Very annoying.

Not able to click through 'vine doors' in brown/white cave missions.

There should be keyboard pitch controls for Yalm (QW too?) piloting.

Character names are in the middle of the person's model when they are in a yalm, not above, making them impossible to read.

There are nine mission slots in the mission pane, yet you can only have three missions at a time. Allowing three single player missions and three team missions would be ideal. Also, quests like the Dodga tasks take up valuable single/team mission space.

/follow should be more reliable, shouldn't break when the target goes out of range, and shouldn't break when zoning.

Blaster beetles do NOT belong in missions. 'Nuff said.

Use of right clicking (looting corpses and chests, picking doors and locks, etc) randomly dies in missions (unsure about hunting), requiring a zone to get working again.

Invisible walls in the sky above Tir make flying around a pain. Invisible hurdles on the ground in Last Ditch make running around a pain.

The three cluster terminals in neutral shops aren't in order from Faded to Shining like they are in Clan shops. Unsure about Omni shops.

I regularly have three more hitpoints than my max. ie, the Stats pane (ctrl-9) will show 2576/2573.

My left hand, since the Sol Chironis SMG is so short, is holding thin air when in idle mode and is holding thin air *in front of the muzzle* when I am in attack mode. Must hurt.

The entire back wall in the mission entrance rooms is a zone border rather than just the door. This is annoying when you hug the walls trying to avoid the insane agro rate in team missions when mobs see you through the door from the main room. Stores are the same way.

The yellow mission marker on your compass sometimes disappears unless you are pointed directly at the mission or to one side; when looking to the other side the marker disappears.

Sometimes when taking my Night Vision Goggles off the night vision effect doesn't go away even though the goggles are off. Putting the goggles back on causes the night vision effect to stack to blinding levels. I haven't had this happen twice for three levels of night vision (yet). No idea what causes it, requires a zone to fix.

Items that can go in more than one slot (sleeves, rings, bracers, NCU items, etc.) many times will not go into the right equip slot when you drop them on your paper doll. This will also sometimes unequip another item with the new item in it's place.

There should be a way, apart from zoning, to cancel putting on a vehicle (or any item) as it equips.

When launching the game in windowed mode, the window should open in the same place it was when the game was last closed down, not the center of the screen.

I *hate* hitting corners in the grid catwalks causing you to fall to the ground.

The chat background is too light, a lot of the time when it's bright out it's very hard to read the text. Making it a darker shade of grey would help a lot.

And lastly, a request:

I would have loved to have had tank armor that went in the leg slot. Give it AC and drawbacks relative to regular tank armor. I want to look like a total badass, not just a badass from the waist up.

bever @ 7/12/2002 8:53:07 AM (Black view when indoors 37721):
Since last patch my view goes black when I use map indoors. This is specially annoying in missions since I need the map there. Outdoors every thing is OK. When is this going to be fixed?

Kissysuzuki @ 7/12/2002 11:33:05 AM (37504):
I got a token 1 night as loot on a body. that was nice.


but on the whole I agree unless I'm at 100% I rarely see a token.

Especially anoying when the Boss is in the way of geting to the rest of the MOBs.

The numbr of time I've had to run around like a headless chicken just to get him out of the way is unreal.

Aristaeus @ 7/12/2002 12:22:13 PM (37709):
If you fall you take 1 hp more damage then stated
ex : you take 9 damage check <ctr-9> and see that you've lost 10.

Shantelle @ 7/12/2002 5:10:40 PM (Female Flowers Tech green belly 37794):
Please please please get rid of the luminous green belly on the female flowers tech.  It doesn't happen on female basic tech armour, so it cant be that big a change.

Can it ?  ;P

Khaitlene @ 7/12/2002 6:34:24 PM (Invisible MOB's killing me. 37812):
Running a mission yesterday I encounter a Mob in the next room.
Get close to it and it aggros me.
I back up from it into the room I just came from.
It runs away in the opposite direction.
Disappears off the map view.
I start getting hit by this phantom mob.
I cannot calm, attack back or run from it because it is nowhere to be seen.
After 20 seconds I am in the corner with 100 HP's left...whack, dead with a nice view of reclaim terminal.

What the hell has just happened?

Dies twice yesterday from this, 2 hours of experience and now completely wasted time, down the tubes.

MaDezzie @ 7/12/2002 10:23:41 PM (37721):
A friend of mine has this same problem, and it didn't start until 14.4 went live.  He petitioned about it and an ARK told him that its a known problem with players that use a Voodoo video card.  So basically she said it was his problem, not FC's even though this particular problem wasn't triggered until the 14.4 patch.

MaDezzie @ 7/12/2002 10:46:21 PM (37181):
Lag has been terrible since 14.4.  I never get it outside mission areas, but when in a mission, solo or team, the lag is in full force.

First for team missions...

I play a MA so I tank a lot.  This past week especially has been hell.  I receive ghost damage on every single mob that attacks me.  It goes something like this...

You hit mob for 1500 points of brawl damage.
Mob hits you for 238 points of melee damage.
You hit mob for 378 points of fire damage.
You received xxxxx amt of xp.
Mob tried to hit you but missed!
You hit mob for 435 points of fire damage.
Starting attack failed...
Starting attack failed...
[Team]Dezzie: uh oh ghost damage, start healing guys
You were hit for 439 points of damage
You were hit for 342 points of damage
You were hit for 300 points of damage

That's just one aspect of this lovely lag that's afflicted us players.  Mobs still warp through walls.  One minute they're standing next to me, the next instant they're across the room, or in a completely different room running into a wall, I start running towards them, only to find that in the next second, they warp back to where I used to be standing.  Doors in team missions do not open when a teammate passes through it, they just kinda disappear through it, very annoying when you're supposed to be following.  Finally the HP bars.  These are FUBAR Funcom.  A person can be listed at full health (even when I have them targetted), then after a few seconds of them being hit, I ask, is that mob even touching you?  5-10 seconds later I see their health drop from full to half (or less).

In a solo 'subway' mission in Clon****.  I get about 5 rooms into the mission and suddenly the next door is blacked out.  I end up making my way through it only to find that every single door after that is also blacked out.  Every room I entered after that was empty and full of blacked out doors.  I back track and end up getting stuck inside because one of the doors wouldn't let me through.  I petition stuck in mission, twice.  After 30 minutes (this long a wait for that type of petition is insane if you ask me, it used to take 2-5 minutes), I finally get an ARK, and he tells me that the server has my position listed as being at the mission entrence room.  In the hour I was inside, the server never recognized me as moving around.

I say to the ARK, ya know this sort of problem has been around for quite some time, are the dev's even investigating this?  He says yes, but its not necessarily Funcom's fault.  He says a lot of times its the players ISP, and server that uses.  In response to this I laugh and remind him that the majority of players have the same lag problems I do, and the the ONE thing we players all have in common is Funcom's game server.  All he said in response was, ok, well do you need anything else?

-Dez

MaDezzie @ 7/12/2002 10:50:58 PM (37504):
On 50% solo missions, I noticed that if I was under say 95%, I wouldn't get a token.  On harder solo missions, say 75% or higher, even if I only get to 50% complete, I usually get a token.  For team missions, since they're always much much harder then 50%, we always get tokens if we hit past the 75% complete mark.

Difficulty seems to have a much bigger factor then just % completed, from my experience anyway.

-Dez

Shyenia @ 7/13/2002 12:54:21 AM (37181):
2 points I would like to make:

1. If your getting lag pop up your browser, if you play in windowed mode, and log onto yahoo or google. If the page pops up in less than 3 or 4 seconds. Your connection is good and it is FUNCOM's servers that are to blame.

2. In all my 5 years of playing games online our ISP is less than 5% at fault. It is always either heavy internet traffic, a relay post somewhere in tin-buck-too just died, or the server at your destination just died. 

So the next time an ARK or GM tries to claim ISP tell em to shove it. It's just an excuse to get you off their petition board.

Ooo, I can't believe someone else said that than me. Of course I've not been following MP board for a while but before I retired my MP (quite some time ago) I did post about this - so very annoying problem.

nait @ 7/13/2002 9:57:40 PM (Tradeskill Recipes Bugged.  Well, duh, but... 38047):
Does anyone have an idea as to roughly what percentage of weapon recipes are actually bugged?  It seems as though every single one my guild has attempted to assemble has been impossible to complete because the recipes are broken.  Should we be submitting bug reports on every single one of these as we come across them?  

There's little point to the engineer class for many players if they can't actually build the schlock they set out to assemble.

Falikos @ 7/13/2002 10:50:14 PM (Swarm of Vulture Quibblers assault ICC 38053):
Over the past couple of weeks a swarm of Vultures have been terrorizing ICC. The guards in place are either poorly trained, or are mere braggarts as all they can do is talk about how much the vultures are going to hurt. Extermination of the Vultures surrounding ICC is desperately needed.


----------------------------

Anyway, you've got a serious bug going on with vultures spawning in walls in ICC. They are *not* being led in through the tunnel. I spend a great deal of time there and can attest to the randomness of this. I've summoned 2 ARKs and ran into a GM and both told me they'd report it, but seeing as though it's been going on off and on since the patch I figure I better post it here as well. The vultures sometimes, but not always appear on the radar, but the guards will all go on and on about killing the thing without actually firing. You need to fix the spawning issue and have them not spawn as they do. 

"You'll be sorry you came here Falikos. For we guards won't shut up" is what they should be saying 

Oh, and resetting their agro target only works for a little while (by seeing them attack someone else, or calming them). Eventually they'll go back to trash talking the vulture.

Thanks

The servants of 8 body and leg armor looks just like a primus, so that's probably what you're seeing.

Clairedanes @ 7/14/2002 10:32:00 AM (37812):
Same occurance happened to me today and quite often in the recent patch.  An invisible mob is there, I seem to be able to shoot back, but can't use specials like fling (no line of sight) or cast nano's (like calm).  Lost a hearty 1.6 million xp that way on a solo mission.  Would have ran away but the doors were black and could not pass through them.  So, just as you, I died backed into a corner.  But really, work on the expansion Funcom, don't finish this beta.

Naraya @ 7/14/2002 3:44:36 PM (Don't know if this is a known issue or not.... 38161):

Naraya @ 7/14/2002 3:46:21 PM (37812):

Docmax @ 7/14/2002 4:32:25 PM (37181):
It's FunCom's servers, there is no doubt about that.  When you have a team of 6 poeple from all over the world and you have a guild with people from all over the world and they all say "LAG" at the same time, it's not everyone's ISP at the same time.  

We need to make sure FunCom knows the servers are unplayable.

thresholdrpg @ 7/15/2002 2:04:59 AM (Using IPR points 38232):
Does this work or not?

I have heard some horror stories.

What is the safest way to use these?

Have they been fixed in 14.4?

Thanks,

thresholdrpg @ 7/15/2002 3:46:58 AM (RELOADING BUG: It has existed since RELEASE! 38249):
When I returned from quitting in Sept 2001, I hoped they had fix this annoying bug during the intervening 10 months.

You start a fight with Weapon 1.

You use full auto or burst with it.

You swap to Weapon 2.

You complete the fight with Weapon 2 (and you win, of course, or else this is pretty much moot).

You then do one of the following:

1) Reload Weapon 2. Wait for reload. Switch to Weapon 1 and try to reload Weapon 1.

or:

2) Immediately switch to Weapon 1 and try to reload it.

Either way, the weapon simply WILL NOT reload much of the time. Sometimes it does, but at least 50% of the time it does not. Weapon 1 will be at something like 0/5, 1/5, 2/5, or whatever. The character executes the "reaload animation", but no status bar appears on the screen, and no reloading actually happens.

The only way to reload the weapon is enter combat with it, and when it tries to fire and fails, the game auto-reloads it. This is obviously BAD since it means you have all that time in battle doing nothing.

Now, its bad enough that there is not a nice and simply reload button, command, or macro (at the very least, /reload should be a command). But when you CANNOT reload a weapon at all, it is a real pain. 

Please fix this!

Since I dual wield Alloy and Leadpipe I use a Pillow to enhance my Nano Skills to cast a better Essence / Damage Shield.

Now I do this (while I'm inside a mission area)
unequip my pipe
equip my pillow
cast
unequip the pillow
equip my pipe

Kismet @ 7/15/2002 12:48:20 PM (Yalm Not Working Properly 38318):
After saving my credits for a very long time, yesterday I bought a Yalmaha.  It unequips every time I zone, and I take fall damage.  The only way I can unequip it is to zone, so if I'm traveling to an outside location, I can't use it because when I get to my destination, I can't unequip it.  I have tried relogging, unequipping inside a building, zoning without it, then putting it on -- basically everything I can think of -- to try to get this piece of equipment to operate correctly.   My friends who play do not have this problem.  Is this a known bug that is being addressed?

Kismet @ 7/15/2002 12:56:18 PM (Display Problems That Started With 14.2 38320):
I had to reload the entire game in order to get the 14.2 patch to work.  And when the game finally did run for me again, I discovered that any time I'm in an indoor location and the mini map is displayed, my entire screen goes black.   I have a Voodoo 5500 graphics card, and have been told the problem seems to be limited to players using machines with Voodoo cards.  Not being able to use the mini map during missions is extremely aggravating, but there is also another display problem related to the mini map.  Whenever I'm flying outdoors, and have the mini map displayed to help me navigate, the distance view on my regular screen immediately becomes out of focus and I can't see anything ahead.  If I switch off the mini map, the view goes back to what it should be.  This means I have to travel flicking PF10 to turn the mini map on and off as I move, to be able to navigate.  Is there any word on when this is going to be fixed?

Mercatura @ 7/15/2002 1:42:54 PM (38318):
Sounds a lot like when implants affecting Air Nav, or base abilities related to Air Nav, were counted AFTER the check on your yalm. God d4mn that was so annoying, esp using implants at low levels for ql30ish yalms.

Some people told me that some items with ability bonuses are still being counted AFTER when they shouldn't be. Crat suit maybe?

If you're really close on the reqs, check any items you have. Implants should be ok, but some weaps or armor may not be.

When the yalm icon 'reds' or 'greys' out, put it inside a backpack and take it out again. Then try wearing.

Mercatura @ 7/15/2002 1:46:26 PM (38249):
One of the big selling points of going CHS is this bug 

That and the FA & Burst recycle are based on 2.5 instead of 5-7

Mercatura @ 7/15/2002 1:51:42 PM (34102):
Please DON'T fix them.

I don't want to have to take mine off just because every third mob has a 91pt damage shield and every fourth mob has a reflect shield.

That and theres a boss mob type that loves to get some 150+ damage shield stacked with RRFE and more hps than T.

Oh yeah, multiple weapon sliders love to screw with each other. Its not usually a problem with melee weapons, but with ranged it can ruin your week. (Earth to FC: 2 guns = fire twice as fast. Supposed to gain something from raising a skill)

thresholdrpg @ 7/15/2002 3:59:42 PM (38249):
I'd rather they fix the stupid bug =(. A reload button at the same time sure wouldn't hurt either. In fact, the easiest way to fix this might be to just code a reload button from scratch instead of using whatever corked up manual reload mechanism they have in place now.

The CHS looks interesting, but raising MG/SMG a bunch at this point would be very painful. Further, having a full auto requirement as high as assault rifle is a pain since FA isn't a green skill like assault rifle. Thanks for the suggestion though! =)

Demios @ 7/16/2002 1:41:59 PM (37195):
Yup its intended. Its been that way since day 1 and partly the reason why shotguns became a popular choice.

Since some, lets say lvl 124'ish agents, dont have enough IP to raise the duck skill 

I event think it makes perfect sense. Shotgun can be considered an area attack and so can the beam if you take the size into account. That goes hand in hand with the description of the duck skill.

Lifebleeder mob line uses nano resist as defensive skill. So fear them at low lvl

Principe @ 7/16/2002 8:03:16 PM (Death's Gaze NanoProg -- Does it Work? 38608):
Does anyone know if this program works?  I'm contemplating pushing some skills and implants for it but don't want to if it doesn't work.
Thanks.

Jayde @ 7/16/2002 9:32:55 PM (37794):
The green is roughly the color Funcom uses for "transparant" on their PNG texture files. Most likely, this color is improperly read, or a shade off of the "pure green" it needs to be to be read by the texture engine.

Would probably be pretty easy to fix, but Funcom will never do it. =P

Shyenia @ 7/17/2002 12:43:17 AM (37181):
Last night was the last straw I could not keep my mouth shut in game any longer. Having dropped from the server, FunCom's side disconnect mind you, I had to relog 4 times in the Broken Shores zone. After losing 1.6mil (equivelant to 2 levels) I decided the servers were F.U.B.A.R.'ed to the point we could not do missions. So I petitioned and sat in Omni HQ waiting for an ARK. Guess what I dropped another 2 times while in Omni HQ. So a total of 6 server drops and 2 levels of exp lost I was getting peeved.

When the ARK finally replied I gave my account of events as well as the names of my other guild mates and friends who were in my team and organization who got dropped at the same time. Quoting that they were in such differing locations as

BC Canada
California USA
Iowa USA
Forida USA

The ARK finally admitted that the server we were on was having troubles and that they should be gone by now. My response was to ask if the servers worked on  a zone-to-zone basis or per population. FunCom would not disclose that so I moved onto my complaint which was:

"Well if FunCom Realm servers are based on a server farm then is FunCom working on server stability because there is a post on the boards that a lot of people are citing similar issues."

The ARK's response.
"Server crashes are not an uncommon occurance. They do happen. However FunCom is aware of the server side drops and are constantly working to improve the situation."

To this I say 
BAH
I worked in a corporation selling servers. The promise we had to make to the customer was to guarentee that our servers would not be down for more than 3% of the year!!!!!!! FunCom servers are down around 10-15% of the year. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE by corporate standards.

Cosmik, Cz
If you read this you should let your engineering/MIS department know that their servers are subpar and need to be overhauled cause your promise to us customers of constant online time is quickly faultering!

Sorry that should not be your promise, but FunCom's promise

So, Support beams aren't thrown, and they definitly don't explode, so why is duck the defence skill?!? Seems like it should evade clsc like other 1he and 2he weapons. 

I based my defence skills off the descriptions so this really annoys me! My close combat and dodge range skills are high, but my duck is 1/3 of that since throwing weapons aren't in the game, and I have never seen anyone using gernade weapons. This worked well for me until I tried to PVP with a beam toting enforcer! 

So can this be fixed, or can we at least get an explination as to why it's Duck not Evade? And if the explination is "We goofed," please follow that with "We'll fix it!"

Well I did petition and you all probably know the anwser :" We do not plaah plaah plaah plaah". 

AO is way too unfriendly against players. This will be my last post for now and maybe forever in these forums and my last logout/login was when ark said those words.

I have had way too many issues anyways after 14.4 came so I am not even little bit sad of this.

Just all to know dont WAIT any support from FC in ANY matter!

Reason AO is bugged is that the company isnt nothing but BUG.

Nianna @ 7/17/2002 3:45:16 PM (Cannot sell mission pick-up items from chests 38767):
This bug has been around for a long time but only really started to bother me a lot lately.

When you get a pick up item in a mission, there is something done to it that will not allow you to sell it from inside a backpack.  Basically you have to take every mission pick up item (which you get to keep in observe item missions) out of the backpack and put it in main inventory then sell it from there.  The exact same item will be sellable from in your backpack if you got it some other way like as the mission reward itself (the thing you were rewarded after you picked up the pick up item), bought it from a store, or got it out of a chest.

At one time this behavior used to be useful since it would allow you to figure out which nano crystals were "permanent" and which were not.  Now its just an annoyance.  Any chance we could get this fixed?

Taebo @ 7/17/2002 7:15:07 PM (Shops have lousy selections... 38816):
EVERY Superior shop I hit looking for Flowers Armor (other armor is this way too) has JUST Female tops and Helmets.

As of the last patch or so (14.2?) I never see Flowers Sleeves, Pants, Male Body Armor, Boots or Gloves. There is always 2 Female tops and 1 or 2 Helmets.

Other armor seems to only have certain pieces too.

I know it's random, but I never see these other pieces.

If certain shop locations had different pieces to make it harder, that's ok, but I see the same selections in Omni-E, Omni Trade, 20k or Lush Resort (all have a Superior Shop for Armor).

This is also the case with MA Special Attacks.

The weapon shops *seems* ok, as I see various weapons offered and it seems to cycle.

This has been going on for a couple patches: you finally find the item you're looking for, you click "Accept Mission", and *Poof* nothing. No message saying "You got a new mission", nothing.

You have to search another half hour to get it again, and cross your fingers in hopes that it lets you actually *have* the mission... 

This happens about 1 in 10 times, Win 98 and Win XP.

Please fix this.

Thanks.

Any suggestions?

Patent @ 7/18/2002 4:34:39 PM (I would like my pads back please... 39015):
I logged on today to find my Dogda 2nd quest pads where replaced with a ql60 basic detox pad. After petitioning, the ark informed me that items cannot be replaced. I would just like to know why a Nodrop/Unique item that I can prove I had ( I still have the second card) cannot be replaced. I am neutral and spent a good amount of time to get both the Alvin and Dogda pads, not really interested in doing the quests again. This seems 
fairly simple to me, as I can not sell or trade the pads, there is an obvious bug. Some kind of response besides no would be appreciated.

Abunari @ 7/18/2002 4:40:54 PM (39015):
My friend has a backpack in this bank that he can take out, but can't open.  He can't trade the backpack and when he zones, the bag disappears from his inventory and shows up in the bank again. 

He's done everything from removing all items and uniques and still can't get the bag out (which contains all the high level guns he's been saving up for use when he's high enough level).

When the ARK showed up for his petition, he was relayed to a GM.  GM said "I'll look into it."  We've never heard back.

So, you'd get the pad back faster by re-doing the quest than by asking, begging, paying for help.

Docmax @ 7/18/2002 6:24:50 PM (37181):
I hadn't played a mission in about a week and as a result I was beginning to think the server lag was gone, but I played a mission last night and it was there.

2 to 15 seconds of lag every 2 to 4 minutes.

FunCom?  can you comment on the source of the lag?  It is your servers or your ISP?

It makes the game very difficult to tolerate.

OriginalBrembo @ 7/18/2002 8:47:52 PM (Is your Wen Wen broken too? 39063):
I got one, but that sum-***** don't do nothing but sit up there and take up space!

That's it!  That's all it does!

The description would lead you to believe that it is suppose to do damage to the enemy - but it don't.

You'd expect to see a beam shoot out, or a message for the damage appear - but you don't.

Hell, I'd even settle for some funky sound - but it don't.

Roots I love - they work if they connect and you can count on them unless someone breaks the root

SNARES - another issue altogether 

I am seeing more frequently the Snare being cast successfully and yet there is no change in speed of mob. Mob glows with the wonderful green nano but the speed is unaffected. 

Ppl say to snare, then root - but that isn't working either. And I shouldn't have to cast one nano to get another to work as it's supposed to. 

Others suggest letting the Mob come up to you and mess you up a bit b4 you cast the snare so the mob is still upon casting - again, why should I have to do this? If the snare malfunctions i'm toast and if it works I just took 1.5k damage...

C'mon FC, fix the bugs.
It's been one year and the lag is as bad as ever, MOBs still warp thru walls and become invisible, items don't work, arrghhh.

Platy @ 7/20/2002 2:00:23 AM (Battlesuits, displaying weapons, and displaying their damage/attacks 39321):
Why is it that my weapon doesn't display when I wear my battlesuit? (on my chatacter Platy2 - as my other character Platy doesn't wear one)

I was hoping that it would be fixed when in the 14.0 patch you guys announced that you're fixing the bugs with battlesuits.  Well, you did fix a lot of them (like crashing every time i tried to grid ), but the weapon display and attack times/damage output display is still not working correctly.
I've found that it holds back an attack, then delivers 2 attacks, rinse and repeat. - the wole time showing a punch attack.
I'm an level 112 Atrox Enforcer wearing a ql 150 Omni-Pol Elite Battlesuit and weilding a ql 200 Premium Rider Warblade.  (they were hard as nails to get equipt, and my nano skills are gimped because of it, but I think it's worth it )

Just wondering if you guys are working on displaying weapons correctly and the combat time/bug thing.. thanks in advance

MaDezzie @ 7/20/2002 2:33:01 PM (37181):
Another thing I forgot to mention in my previous post was this..

Ever since patch 14.4 I get random screen freezes.  My screen just hangs there for about 5-10 seconds, looks like I'm about to LD, then suddenly snaps back to life.  Anyone else getting this?  Happens only in missions.  ALL the lag issues happen only in missions for me.  Even in the center of trade during peak hours, the worst I get is reduced frame-rate, but throw me in a mission and the game goes nuts.

Still no official reply about this..

Dominata @ 7/21/2002 11:18:51 AM (Calms severely broken... 39545):
Since last patch calms are more or less useless. Calmed mobs still fight, both melee and ranged, or the calms just slip off after a second even if I get the message that the program was axecuted successfully. Last night we had a room with four MP's hitting with chem dmg from their shields, red to the four of us. This is tricky even with fully functional calms but now it turned into a slaughter house. After a couple of trips to the reclaim we finally wore them down but i was thoroughly digusted with it all.
My team consisted only of people from my own guild who I team up with all the time, they all know how to work together and knows to avoid calmed mobs. We did not break the calms ourselves.
This was the single worst example from last night since people actually were killed, which almost never ever happens in my teams. They all respect my calming skills and trust me to keep adds under control, when they started dying I felt so bad about the whole thing I almost logged off. After we finished the mission no one felt like doing another, we all lost the spark.

When bugs like this pop out of nowhere it kills the game, it kills it by taking the fun out of teaming. When skills and tactics suddenly becomes pointless we lose heart and interest to continue. Since aggro is so severe in team missions it is crucial that calms work, at least in a teams that's not solely consisting of Atrox Enforcers. It so bad it deserves an emergency patch...

Borox @ 7/21/2002 6:18:42 PM (Can't heal or recharge outside boss room, intended, or bug? 39584):
yesterday I tried soloing a team mission with my alt ( lvl 43ma). I cleared all the floors, and got ready to storm the boss room. He had two cronies inside with him, and I had to zone out a couple times to heal before I could kill both of them, then started on the boss. He was orange to me, and very tough so I fought as long as I could and zoned out to heal. Down in the lower floor I tried to heal and kept getting the message "can't use this item in a fight " over and over. I tried running down to the next level, and was able to heal there once, but never again. Eventually I was forced to abort the mission because I couldn't do anything but maybe zone all the way out to try and fix the problem. I also tried to log out and back in, but I couldn't log out in a fight. I would like to know if this is a bug or not before I spend all that time again for nothing, or try another type mission

Trust me, this has never been a problem before. Something has changed, and not for the better. I am not the kind of person to whine about things just because I do not know how to behave in AO. 
Other NT's in my faction have the same problem so I know that it's not an isolated incident.

I think overflow should override so short thinking troxes like me wont get the overflow deleted.

Anyway, Madmartok did feel so sorry for me that he gave me a QL200 elite battle suit so i was abit more happy when leaving

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 5:32:36 AM (Completely UNacceptable! 39705):
What exactly has to happen before we stop paying and stop playing a game that is riddled with more bugs than content?

I've been keeping a list of blatant bugs and will someday post it... though I am not sure why I would even bother.  Most of these bugs are already known by the (I hate to use this word)... developers.. of the game.

Many many many people have suffered losses (items, exp, money, time) in this game (Yes, I know it is 'Just a Game')... but most of us pay to 'play' and we do not look forward to paying to sign on and just be frustrated day after day.

I would not stand by silent for an instant if my new car were anything less that in full working order.  Nor continue to pay for a monthly service of any kind that was not what was promised me when I signed the agreement FOR that service.

There are some sympathizers that will read this and think I am just whining or complaining and if I dont like it, just leave.  Well, that is exactly my point, I am not sure I want to stay if things are not going to change.  These 'love' patches have nothing to do with anything but trying to keep me paying every month, hey certainly do not replace the items I have lost, or better still.. repaired the PROBLEM that causes the constant losses and frustrations.

I've recently lost 4 bags of items I have been saving.  I even used the insurance terminal before I opened the bank.. Then poof, I got booted, came back to discover that the 4 bags that had been in my inventory after removing them from the bank... were gone.  They were not in the bank again, not in my inventory, not on the ground or anywhere I could see.  Then I discovered that I was not the only one to get booted, many other people had.  Then 10 minutes later while waiting in 37th place in the Petition Queue... everyone got booted as the server crashed.

After hours of waiting, I finally got some robot of a GM who came to tell me I was screwed.  The policy is we dont replace anything, no matter how weird or common the bug is, no matter what the reason... unless of course you are well known as running an AO based website.  But thats another story.

After tyhe server crash, I discover that my exp bar is 20% lower than what it was.  I know where it was, because my girlfriend and I both play together exclusively... and hers was where it had been before I was booted and now my bar was 20% lower than hers.  Sure, no big deal.. just go hunt for an hour and get it back.

I am now wondering why I would even bother?  If my items are not safe, why collect them?  If I do not need items, why get exp to get even better ones?  Thus... why even worry about the loss?

I've pre-paid and now feel like I have been taken.  There is absolutely zero customer service in this game.... because I have never, and will never.. accept "There is nothing we will do" as customer service... that is just completely unacceptable.

Ditka @ 7/22/2002 6:05:01 AM (26055):
WELL, I got bored, and the girlfriend REALLY misses AO, so we're back. 

I remain unconvinced that FC managment actually has the vision to pull it all off, I think that level reqs are the worst mistake they've ever made, but 6 weeks w/o playing has at least removed the "high-lvl boredom" factor. 

on another note:

Fix the bug
Change my name Cosmik!!! :-P

Asmodea @ 7/22/2002 9:02:52 AM (Collection of "active" bugs 39726):
Hello,

cause the old sticky thread is long obsolet. I try to start a new bug collection thread. If you add your bugs try to keep them short but disciptive. ( Please no spam responses !)

1) You still bounce one a while at a zone border. ( Server can't load new zone .. or so)
2) Visual removal of social armor if you zone or equip new armor parts. You have to take it out and on every time you zone.
3) In team missions you sometime can't see one of your team mates. He has to zone to be visual again. Sometimes you also can see him again, if you went to the last "seeable" position of him.
4) Sometimes mission doors don't open for one of the team mates, so he can't enter the mission.
5) Dual wielding: Stop firing with your off hand if you main hand reloads v.v.
6) Many, Many construction receipts are not working. ( FIX THEM ! )
7) It's still possible to get missions to positions on step ahad of a zone border. ( So you can't get to the mission. )
8) Wen-Wen don't work 
9) If your skill ist just enougth to fill your weapon requirements it seem that you get oe penalties. ( My smg that eactly fills my smg and burst skill, was servly laking damage against my older one.) Maybe weapon skill buffs are ignored ?
10) Fixers NCU-Compressors are buged. You have to deactivate all buffs after the NCU-Compressor runs out. A recast without deactivating all won't reset the correct NCU Value.
11) Sometimes your still attacked from mobs a million rooms aways.
12) "You aren't allowed to loot" message for dead mobs or treasure, even in single missions or if /team loot all

beginning.. more to come

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 10:36:39 AM (39584):
If you leave the boss room and go back up or down to the previous 'level', the boss still has you targetted and is trying to fight you... so you wont be able to sit and do any actions that usually require sitting (ie; using treatment labs, nano kits, camp, etc)... however, you CAN stay there as long as you need and use the first aid and nano stims until you are fully healed and full of nano.. this will take a while to do however.

Keep in mind that while  you do this, the boss's regeneration rate is healing him/her/it as well.

Sometimes running a few rooms away and waiting for anywhere between the required 10 seconds and as long as 2 minutes, I can finally sit down and heal or replace my nano or camp if that is what is needed.  In other words, get out of his range and 10 seconds after you do, you should be able to sit and use those items or actions normally again.  As long as he has you targetted and is focusing on you, you wont be able to.

Hope this helps.

Asmodea @ 7/22/2002 10:54:30 AM (official bug page ? 39745):
Also i have a short plea... can you please make a official bug list page, with status;date;priority;progress (and maintain ist !)? You could make many post unnesseary and will lift the darkness of witch bugs are in work and with not if you will make such a page.

And if you think the needed manpower to care such a page is to high i would suggest a link to your internal request managment system or ask a fan page to do it.

Happens to me all the time.  I use WinME and it is so damn frustrating to spend the credits and the time and the health of my fingers to click click click.. get the item and in a place I can actually get to.... then have nothing happen when I hit accept.

And so I double double triple check I have the correct mission selected before praying, wishing and taking a deep breath, removing all heavy (throwable) objects from my desk... then click "accept mission".

My girl has this exact same trouble from time to time, she using win98.b

Dont look for it to be addressed, or even acknowledged from your friendly neighborhood FookedCom, they are too busy coding an Expansion "Attack of the CloneBugs".

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 11:01:44 AM (26055):
Well, this is probably the one and only bugs I have yet to encounter... but now you guys have me worried.   I dont know if they need to be changing your name over it, but they certainly need to look into it, fix it and start reimbursing people for the losses their bugs are costing us.

No.. its YOUR ISP!

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 11:08:12 AM (39015):
Wow, nice...  and to be honest, it sounds like a just end to your troubles.... you lucky bastard.

I wish I had known I was going to get booted today just before the server crashed on RK2 (gee, what a surprised!  

If I had known, I could have taken the screenshot of the 4 bags of items I've had in my vault for 2 months that I took out today.. then got booted.. came back, bags are NOT in my inventory, not in the bank and nowhere to be found.  After 4 hours of waiting to speak with a GM, one finally showed up long enough to tell me I was out of luck and no items would be replaced.

I asked to be 'restored to my last save point' since I had just saved 10 minutes before, not 5 feet away.

He actually said "We dont do that" and I asked if he was serious and he said, "Sorry, I cannot help you, sorry for your loss"

Well, in my dealings with the FC puppets (GMs) thus far, I have heard precisely one truthful statment from ever single one of them.

"Sorry"  Must be Customer Service's motto.  I'd say it suits them.

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 11:13:14 AM (37794):
I agree with Jayde...

unless this post gets about 2000 views and 50 to 100 replies minimum, FC will never pay any attention to the bug.

As for me... I say fix it... I wanna see dem girls navels!

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 11:16:10 AM (38767):
Cross your eyes... you'll get more results than crossing your fingers.  Hehe.

I agree, it is something that needs to go on the 'repair list', which is much longer than the 'features list'

TerorRaen @ 7/22/2002 11:26:07 AM (38741):
Same thing happened to me today... lost 4 bags of nice items, posted about it til I am blue in the face and probably pissed off half the folks that read my posts.

No help from FC, got the standard you are fooked reply from a GM, and I can only assume my feedback-support email will be ignored like the rest of them have been.

My account is active until Aug something... I do not forsee letting them charge my card again.

This game HAD great potential, but the incompetence of the staff, the unavailablility of real customer care or customer service along with the bugs, which have far out-numbered the features for a long time now.... have ruined this game.

With all the other games releasing over the next 12 months, I forsee more people leaving .. far more than will arrive.

This one is turning to dust.

Not really a bug. You only can have 2 extra inventory-like windows open at the same time. Same as going through stuff in bank. You pick one bag from it, open it...nah, wrong bag, pick another, open it...poof, bank window gone.

This one is simple. When in a mission you only load the surrounding rooms. Everytime you go into one of these rooms your client is receiving information from the server to load the rest of the rooms. Now if you don't have a fast enough connection to update the mobs pathing your client is going to freeze for a moment while it updates the other mobs. Only way I have found to fix this is to log off drop your graphics down and log back in.

Skyhigh @ 7/23/2002 5:00:36 AM (Crashing during missions bugs 39927):
This is what happen when i crashed back to the desktop for no apparent reasons during my mission earlier today. Before crashing the mission was 75% completed. 

1st thing : When i came back, all the monsters i killed before were back but the mission was still at 75%. 

2nd thing : I reach 100% mission completion but the dungeon was still 75% full of monsters. 

3rd thing : Proceed to kill all the monsters i already killed before the crash and noticed i was getting the same loot again ! I end up having everything in double ! 

4th thing : All the chest were back too, same thing happen with the monsters all the loot i got before the crash was there again. 

This must be known already but i just want to be sure you're aware of these bugs.

Skyhigh @ 7/23/2002 5:04:41 AM (39832):
Never got Master not known, but often get system overide not attacking.....    

Often get not responding pet, seems like he's only responding to my command when it's 10 feet from me.

TerorRaen @ 7/23/2002 7:35:23 AM (39832):
oooh, for once a question that is not bug related.... first time for everything...

The reason your pet is not responding or says "Master not Recognized" is that your nano skills to command him have fallen below the 20% required to use that pet.

For example, if you NEED 121 in MC and TS to control the pet, and your skills drop to 100 or less, you have either lost a buff, or been debuffed by a mob and until you get your skills back to the minimum requirements, (100 in this example)  the pet will remain unresponsive and only attack if it is attacked directly.

Hope this helps.  (my numbers may not be exact, but regardless, that message means your skills are not high enough).

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 9:43:18 AM (@@@@ Hey, Coding Morons..... Fix the Death while Zoning bug 39966):
Its been over a year. 

This bug has existed that long. 

Numerous patches you have said you fixed it. 

You haven't. 

My wife died *twice* last night to this bug. Both times she zoned out with between 3/4 and FULL health, only to listen to the gunfire or melee hits as her character is killed. 

Don't give me this bull**** about "oh, the client and the server were out of sync." First of all, that is your cop out for every bug these days. Guess what: that means your client and server need to poll each other to find out how things are going, and if they are off, prevent severe things like death. And Second, we play from a T1, so it ain't our connection flubbing up..... its yours. 

This bug has been around so long and it is one of those real "heart breaker bugs." The kind that are so hideous that they really suck away your desire to play the game. 

After quitting once, my wife has been back 3 days now. The death while zoning bug may have ended her return (personally, I hope it hasn't). 

To add insult to injury, your policy of never reimbursing people for deaths is really getting ridiculous. I have a screenshot of a bug that killed one of my characters a day or two ago where the ARK said "yeah, that death is due to a known bug that they are working on.... but no, I cannot reimburse you." 

Screenshot of that outrageous statement: 

http://www.threshold-rpg.com/phalan...ttabejoking.gif 

So basically, the message is this: 

1) Fix the year old bugs for christ sakes. 

2) Reimburse people for known bugs. Does it really hurt you to reimburse xp for crying out loud? Many times, the time people spend waiting for their petition and spending 30 minutes talking to the ARK is close to, or at least half the time it would have taken to get the exp by killing stuff. But at least they don't feel nearly so screwed over by buggy code.

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 9:50:00 AM (39927):
Sadly, the bugs you explain have been in the game SINCE RELEASE.

Over a year, and still not fixed.

Pathetic.

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 9:53:48 AM (39015):
I actually feel bad for the GMs and ARKs. They are the hard working folks who are forced to deliver the line of complete BULLSH IT that funcom forces them to spew.

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 10:19:37 AM (37181):
The last few days (July 20-23) I have experienced:

1) Inability o cast nano programs: basically, for a while, I hit the button to cast, and it says "Running such and such", but nothing happens. 

2) I kill a monster, get the exp, get the +% chance for token, and it keeps dishing out damage.

3) Monsters doing melee damage to me from 4 rooms away.

4) My wife has died TWICE while zoning (and she started zoning once with full health, once with 3/4 health).

5) Phantom Damage. Everything is going along fine, then I get 15 lines of "You are hit for 34 points of damage." My wife has experienced this as well. It can be fatal or nearly fatal.

6) Frequent server dumps: The game just dumps you and you have to relog.

I play AO from a dedicated T1 that is only used by myself and my wife. The problems are 100% on Funcom's end.

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 10:21:45 AM (Petition Fraud!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 39974):
Well, looks like Funcom has so many bugs now they know they cannot handle the petitions they have, so they coded in some cheats.

1) Sometimes,you have 0 petitions in front of you, yet yours goes unanswered.

2) Last night, I bounced back and forth between 2 petitions in front of me and 3 petitions in front of me about 4 or 5 times. Where are these phantom petitions coming from, and how are they getting in front of me?

Just admit you have 47 petitions or what not. That is better than lying about the number and making it obvious when the code has to play tricks.

thresholdrpg @ 7/23/2002 10:35:17 AM (943):
1) Death while zoning

2) Guns not reloading when you drop the ammo on them.

3) Nano programms not running when you hit the hotkey for them.

4) Monsters attacking you through walls.

5) Melee mobs hitting you for melee damage from about 40 feet away (I;m talking humanoid mobs here).

6) Phantom Damage: all of a sudden, you see 10 lines of damage.

7) Cannot use treatment labs when teleporting away from boss room.

8) Game has major trouble discerning when you are truly out of combat.

Shyenia @ 7/23/2002 12:25:47 PM (37181):
Of course the problem is on FunCom's end an official FC GM went to the edge of admitting that they have constant server issues.

"We are always looking to improve our server/client stability, but rely on petitions to alert us to such things."

Well I am reading inbetween the lines but I feel that was as close to an admission we will ever get.

Zepto @ 7/23/2002 2:40:19 PM (Overflow Window difficulties 39998):
I have found some difficulties wtih full packs and overflow windows.  The specific example I can think of was this.

In team mission.  Fighting BOSS.  Item was picked up by leader before boss fight.  Overflow window appears with token and reward.  Durring battle with Boss I click on token and reward in overflow window after making room in my pack.  I get error message at bottom of screen You can not do this right now (refering to the fact that I am in a fight).  After fight is over the overflow window is empty, my pack is empty.  Zoneing does not refresh the pack or overflow.  I even close the overflow and combine a inplant/cluster (to force the overflow to reopen) and there is nothing in there.  The items were lost.

Terra @ 7/23/2002 4:00:49 PM (Bugs i know of 40013):
I dont know if these are listed but ill post them anyway...

Use of all right clicking actions on dorrs etc and all control fo player such as sitting (except running and jumping)  cannot be achieved for a reason i do not know. Use fo chests, looting corpses, pick locking, using elevators in team missions inclucding the boss elev. etc etc cannot be odne. The onyl remedy i know of is to cast a nano upon yourself. Extremly annoying bug when i REALLY need to leave the boss room and i cant.

Dramatic scale decrese when leaving a yalmaha is a bug on its own but when your an agent using rune of taren as well you will appear invisible but actually will be as small as a flea. Annoying when people wanting to recruit your or trade with you cnanot because they cant see you when in fact your stading right next to them.

Not so much a bug but a complaint from me- NPC's eprsonally can cast nanos that are too high powered for thier level, even though hunting at 8x8 NPC's are rated orange/dark yellow for me at 8X8 (myself being level 87)  they can cast a nanjo on me that willl dmaage me for 700 points, this twice renders me good as dead leving me with 400 hp, 2 shots or a crit will now finish me of. Perosnally this is not right.... Also Runspeed debuffs from nps ARE dramitcially overrated.. even though i was in a quality 150 mission at the time a nano was cated on me leaving me with -750 yes MINUS run speed, even though the mission was WAY to good for me (even though my team could handle it) i could not run.. i had to walk because it actually lalowed me to move. I can admit the NPC's in the mssion were double my level but i know at the npc level i wont have my run speed + another 750 for the pure fact that i have a yalmaha and dont ened to waste IP on the skill. 

okay thats all from me for now. i hope this issues can be adressed if they have not been already.

Docmax @ 7/23/2002 6:15:37 PM (37181):

Sorry Comfortyou, that is not good enough. That is just a workaround for something that is clearly broken. I can not afford for me or anyone in my team to be jumped by four red mobs before trying to calm them. Besides, I have had adds that refused to be calmed even after aggroing me.

Some things I can accept not working pefectly since I am an NT already. But calms did work up until recently and with our blackholes, our way more than 3% fumble rate and incrased resists it is crucial that we at least have our calms working.

I appreciate the tip you gave me, and my low level Crat who I so far only solo with does not have this problem. At level 144 the prospect of single missions isn't very appealing anymore since missions just go on forever and ever sometimes.

You take care, too.

psycluded @ 7/24/2002 3:56:32 PM (39966):
As far as I know, and I don't really have much knowledge either way, but from what I've heard, I don't think the ARKs have reimburse powers yet. I think they'd have to call in a GM to do that.

Besides, it's almost impossible to verify that you lost what you say you lost, I'd imagine. If they kept detailed logs on every character even back only a half hour or so, their servers would absolutely die under the weight. I know that, even from working with text MUDs.

Have a little patience when working with the ARKs. All of the ones I've met have been very nice and very well spoken, and have tried their best to pursue my problem to aagreeable outcome, even if I don't get what I want, be it a reimbursement or other. They're volunteers, remember? They do this on their play-time, because they love the game and want to help the other players in the game. I've got a lot of respect for them because of that...

I don't know if anyone else has noticed this, but whenever I warp myself (NT nuetral Borealis warp to get specific, although I've had the doc and fixer grid warps do it as well) the nano recharge bar stays up there untill I relog.

 Also, durring battles I have noticed since the last patch that I'll get two attack bars (wepon) for my 2HE wepon, which isn't too big of a deal because after you hit "q" it just goes. But it is also doing it for my nanos, which ends up giving me lost time through my "nano bots being busy" or being unsure which bar is the actual one.

Last thing I need is something else messing with my nukes other than lag, blackholes, and fumbles

How does this help Advents who have to calm when MOBs are in non-aggro state only, eh? =P

I've had several teammates die because I calmed a mob off a boss room warp only to have it NOT calm at all. However, the halo is there, and the team's primary calmer cannot recalm it, since something somewhere thinks it already is calmed. Of course, this doesn't stop them from shooting. Woo.

Longyen @ 7/25/2002 9:49:09 PM (943):
I found a new bug with the MP mezz pet.

The mezz pet causes a really weird bug now.  It will hit a mob and the mob will glow yellow as usual.  The mob will then sit there for about 10 seconds doing nothing but get beat on by you or anyone else.  After that 10 seconds is up, and he is no longer mezzed, he hits whoever he is attacking like 5-15 times siultaneously.

ARKs and GMs have a large tendancy to say simply "oh, it's lag on your end."  Here is why I have problems with that:

I was with my MP friend in a mission.  The mob aggroed me and he sent in his mezz pet.  The mezzer hit the mob.  His healer was on me.  When the mob stops being mezzed, all of a sudden we BOTH see on our screens about 10 hits all at once.  If this had been  a mission with my high level char instead just him helping a lowbie alt of mine, I would have been dead 3 times over.  Every single mob we attacked with the mezzpet the same thing happened.  And each time, whoever it was attacking got hit about 10 times at once.  It almost seems like when a mezz pet mezzes a mob, instead of suppressing the actual attacks themselves, it only suppresses the info, and saves the damage info in some sort of queue.  The second the mezz is up, it applies all of the damage messages in the queue all at once.  Why can't they just make the mezz pet do a normal mezz that lasts only like 10 seconds instead of this pseudo-mezz crap?

Oh yeah, and it isn't just graphical or whatever because the healpet doesn't heal you during that time while the mob is mezzed because you "aren't being hit" and heals cast on you don't give you HP because you "aren't hurt."  And it isn't like in the middle of those 10 damage messages you see a heal message.  No, you get those damage message all together, and all the damage all at once.

Shiori @ 7/25/2002 10:04:17 PM (NCU Belt Disaster 40543):
On two of my characters, I removed a belt and now cannot load another one. Not even the belt I removed. This is a disaster. Do I need to delete them both? Are all my other characters stuck with 1 slot belts forever? I tried zoning. I tried logging. I tried waiting. I tried casting nanos on myself. I have the stats even unbuffed. One character is level 36. I am needless to say pretty unable to hunt with something like 8 ncus available.

Tried asking on OOC channels, all three factions. Tried sending tells to high levels. As a last resort, tried paging a gm and then watched my petition status climb as someone apparently decided this wasn't an important issue.

Please, has anyone else had this problem and is there a workaround?

He was shooting something, but no one could see it, we did not see his health go down either.  He ran outside because he nearly died and the ghost mob started to attack someone else but no one knew it until the victim died

When wearing a cloak or some other types of back armor the Opifex male head seems to get "detached" and moves to the side like someone hacked my head off and put it back on but of the side a little.. it's more of an annoyance then a real bug as it's only a visual thing.. but i'd like to beable to run around without a mask on all the time.. i like the way my face looks.. heh

I agree with you Daeln, It  is almost impossible to believe that a
game that seems this complex (I know very little about programming) would have no fail-safes or methods of protecting the customers...from the game itself.

Destractor @ 7/26/2002 11:24:54 AM (Bot nano does not finish 40640):
Today a mob (maybe q 120) slowed my bot (green swirls)
after 15 minutes waiting it still did not end. needless to say the combined bad pathing with its incredable slow, meant I couldn't even get it into a fight in the hope that might knock it off.

I tried debuffing the bot but the nano would not execute.

Toorqs @ 7/26/2002 11:47:30 AM (extra sweet chocolate surprise 40643):
yesterday i was rolling some mission..i rolled some kind of cake and looked at the stats for some reason. i was stunned to be correct, there i was looking at a cake with the stats of a hammer, and it was 1 handed in addititon.

http://auno.org/aodb.php?t=ag&cmd=view&id=129025

I decided to try this kewl little thingy on my enf (lvl 140)
mostly for show, as he were naked and ipr'ed anyway.

6 hours later i stand there wearing a new set of q 200 imps made for this "cake", found me a +120 grenade buff and a wrangler.

i put the thing on, and "poff" if falls off..
tried 6-7 times, and if went back to inventory as fast as i hit "Q"

this got me fairly annoyed to say the least.

anyone know if this is a bugged item, or if it isnt suppposed to work at all?

even if it reloads , the reload time will make it useless,or worse , it could be like bronto burger etc. an one use item.

Not sure about this,but the graphics for the organic body armor seem to be backwards.  When wearing the armor, you appear to have pectoral muscles on your lower back, and a big brown patch covering your entire front.   Maybe thats the way it was designed, but it looks backwards!

JohnnyVega @ 7/26/2002 1:37:54 PM (Death by unknown 40651):
I was just doing a mission with my lvl 20 atrox. A 100% difficulty mission, not that it matters.
I was fighting a mob and was running out of health at about 100 HP, so I run for the door. and you all know what I'm talking about, cuz you all do it. then, just before I get to the door, I get hit by 301 UNKNOWN damage, and I die. This seems to me as to be a bit unfair, as the mob was only hitting me for 25 damage each hit.

I send a petition, and get in contact with and ARK. I explain the situation, and he says the game is not designed for ppl zoning out to save their life... Hmm... I seem to remember a patch in wich the patch note said something about the mob's breaking off pursuit when the char was getting close to the mission door. to stop mob's hitting you if you have problems Zoning. Why would they implement this feat. if the game wasn't designed for it?

I told the ARK this, and then he started saying that it was because of Server lag... Well... OK. Why didn't he just say so in the beginning?

And the thing that is the most annoying, is that this wasn't my fault at all, it was because of server lag. (I myself think that this is just another one of these stupid excuses the ARK's always come up with because they aint able to do squat sh*t.)
And thus I feel that qualify for some compensation. In form of credit's or whatever. I don't care. give me something to tinker with so that I forget that the game is as bug infested as a donkeys ass.

I'm seriously considering breaking off my subscription to this game, because this stuff happens ALL the time. and nothing is done by the ARK's about it. because they can't do anything.

Falikos @ 7/26/2002 8:41:21 PM (40335):
Oh thanks  Although when I went looking for it I was mighty confused where my post went. 

Anyway, after doing some more testing I think I figured out what is causeing the in battle "extra" nano bar to appear. Team heals. Doc, MA, and Advent team heals are causeing it. Also it happens if a MOB casts a nano on you. 

Seems realitivly random as to if it will cause interuption to the nanos you personally cast, but it can be quite annoying 

Havent' tested it in a PVP situation. I'll see about that tonight.

Also, more on the warp permenant nano bar problem. It seems more likely on nanos with a long cast time. The fixer nanos that are quick that damage the fixer don't do it as often. But should the bar appear it is there till you relog or crash.

Jayde @ 7/27/2002 9:01:46 AM (Boss MOB with MUCH too high-level nuke. 40800):
Tonight, my team was in a QL 141 mission. We were totally wasting everything, until the boss...

In fact, we totally wasted the boss, too. It was pretty weak HP-wise compared to most bosses--the only hitch? It insta-killed one of my teammates with a 2176 point nuke.

Since it was a boss, it was hard to tell if it was an NT or a Crat, but one important fact is that the nuke was Energy damage. This makes it very easy to track down, since there aren't many heavy-hitting energy damage nukes out there.

There are basically only 2 nukes it could be:
Rule of One 
QL 179
Inflicts 1,375-3,211 points of energy-based damage. 

OR

Cascade of the Storm 
QL 175 
Massive bolts of lightning strike the target, inflicting 932-2,218 points of energy-based damage.

Both of these require more than 800 points of MC...and should NOT be on a QL 141 boss. Not by a long-shot. 

The idea that MOBs can cast nukes at their own QL is asanine as it is--without the 50% rule, there are quite a few nukes that can insta-kill PCs, because they are balanced for NPCs with 10 times the HP. But the idea that a nuke 34 QL's above the mission being cast? Absurd.

With the skill required to cast Rule of One, an NT could cast Izgimmer's Little Nuke, which is insta-kill to basically any player no matter what. (2,834-4,739)

LOL
No, if your chance is in the 90's than you have a 90%+ chance of getting the token.
Look, basically speaking if you did infinite missions and attempted to complete the mission at lots of different levels, 1% through to 99% and worked out when you got a token and when you didn't then it would all add up perfectly.
Even if you did 100 missions in a row and each mission you took to 99% and on each of those missions you failed to get a token then it's just bad luck.
It's the eqivalent of rolling a 1 on a D100 100 times in a row, unlikely but still very theoretically possible.

They left the Concealment buff off of the QL10 entry for The Mid in the database.

So rather than scale smoothly, at exactly halfway between the lowest and the highest QL for The Mid, I think QL106, it jumps straight from +0 Concealment to +350 Concealment.

Bosses are quite more challenging and special for their type and I think considering them to be +/~ 10 levels of the ql of the mission is missleading. 

They have more HP, evades and AC than a mob their level and having higher nano skills sounds also reasonable.

NWvoicesStink! @ 7/29/2002 1:12:18 AM (Keep References of ALL your NonDrop items! 41048):
some tim earound september 2001 my NT's yalmha disapeared out of his inventory from a freak accident. i kept a reference of my yalm and petitioned to the ARk, they escelated my petition to a GM -- he asked me to show my reference in the text, without telling me in a long pause of 4mins of silence, he was checking my logs, then he relpaced my yalm!!!

EVERYONE KEEP REFERENCES OF YOU NONDROP ITEMS! THEY MAY REPLACE IT!

Elements of the disapearance fo the yalm:

-zoned into a shop while still in my yalm (this was in the patch that made yalms stay EQUIPPED, but red on your wear menu)
the advanced shop in 20k outpost

-sold a bunch of loot from bags

-i zoned out

- i wasnt in my yalm

-everything in my weapons-wear menu was gone (NCU belt, NCUs, nightvision goggles, and 2 leets)

-my helmet, and cloak was gone along with my yalm!

-my Omni-pol elite pants were regraphiced to a difigutated skirt with the lining and color of the omni-pol elite

-seems like everything in the head, back, and the slot where the yalmah was placed (weapons) was gone.

ADVICE: never zone indoors with a yalm, take the time to unequip it, or keep references of your yalm!!! ( this was around september 2001, i am not sure if the GMs still replaces yalms that have been referenced.)

Longyen @ 7/29/2002 7:58:54 PM (40800):
A few weeks ago I did a team mission using my enforcer, along with a few friends.  We got to the boss, and I died in about 5 seconds.  My enforcer is only level 65, but has about 3200 hp.  Why did she die so fast?  The boss was an NT and the little helpers were all crats.  Every single one nuked me at the same exact time.  Each one was about 600 dmg nuke.  There were 4 helpers and 1 boss.  The boss nuked for about 1000 instead of 600.  All in all, I was hit at the same time for:

600 +
600 +
600 +
600 +
1000 =
3400 dmg

Nice.  Real nice.  F***ing Funcom.

You're one of many many players who want this fixed.  However, fewer people have seen your post here in Game-bugs forum that the 20 other threads in the "Next Patch" or "Suggestions" forums.

Bionitrous @ 7/29/2002 8:19:12 PM (40800):
That's the end result of one of the many poor programming efforts by FunCom.  Every single nuker and caster MOB executes their nanos at the same  exact  instant.  Either a cheap way to be frugal with timers in missions or just poor programming practice.

One way to fix this without rewriting the nano-trigger code would be to prevent 'pairs' of nukers from spawning together.  The room with two NT's would spawn with a Fixer and an NT instead.  Much more interesting anyway.  Instead of two Crats, you get one Crat and an Agent.

It's really transparent how poorly done a lot of the coding in AO is.  Things like the simultaneous nukes are glaring examples of shortcuts and/or oversights that riddle the game's framework.

Docmax @ 7/29/2002 10:25:21 PM (37181):
I didn't play too much over the weekend with my doc, but with my fixer.

My fixer doesn't cast continuously so it was harder to notice the server lag.  My wife was playing an adverturer and healing me and she kept noticing the server lag.  

You only really notice it if you cast continuously, but it is there and makes the servers foul to play on.

Pluteaux @ 7/30/2002 2:01:16 AM (Can't find mission item 41278):
About a week ago, I was doing a mission where you have to find an item to get an item. After killing all the mobs, I searched the mission about 4 times trying to find the item. When I finally found it, it was almost completely buried with only a tiny bit of the tip showing (it was a cone shaped object). Tonight I did the same type of mission--in the meetmedere area with vine doors and gray walls and floors. This time I searched the mission several times but couldn't find the item and had to give up. It seems that items to pick up are always at certain locations in certain rooms. Why doesn't Funcom make sure that all pickup-item types can be seen before putting a particular location on this list? The time I found the item it was in a long room (width of a typical room and length of about 3 typical rooms) that rises up a bit toward the center. I believe this type of mission is new, maybe since 14.2.

Metaing @ 7/30/2002 3:24:57 AM (35110):
It is not just in missions you see the problem. My sister Aalya as Shade hunting in GTC some time ago. The server crashed and the area was reset.  The only thing she had time to see before she  died when relogging was the big teeth of a sandworm. It should be simple to put players in a safe position or keep mobs away from players.

Maxtor 1-7 @ 7/30/2002 7:27:14 AM (39545):
"Calms seems to be funcioning correctly nowdays, thank god "

Not for my crat, the resist chance is not only extrememly high but the calms often have no effect even after they land. Sometimes the calm might not even be registered on the mob even though it landed, sometimes it might get lost because of server sync or whatever, and sometimes the mobs just won't stop fighting.
Now if they stopped with calms landing less often I might be OK, but it is becoming tedious to team because of all the changes.

Snuble @ 7/30/2002 8:16:51 AM (Mobs get free hit when done casting 41321):
I use a damage shield so its pretty simple to see.

What happens is this:

Fight starts, me and mob is taking turns as intended.

MOB decides to cast a nano (of course it shows up in my NCU about 1 s before casting animation even starts). When casting animation stops I get hit 2 times by the mob. But my damage shield only deals one damage for one of those hits. Its a consistent bug. If MOB heals, I get hit twice, if MOB use a dot, I get hit twice. If I get rooted, I get hit twice and so on. 

Try to defend against Frost of Coronet and two crits...

Snuble @ 7/30/2002 8:25:59 AM (Some mobs ignore calms! 41322):
I've seen it several times the last days. I'm and adventurer and can only use calms (or is it mezzes? ) when mob is out of fight. 

Typical scenario:
Red enforcer. Calm and run out of range so he cannot hit me and break the calm. Now when I get within range again, I get the "xxx attacks" message. I've tried to zone after calming to break any aggro, and mobs STILL attacks on sight (brown shimmering still around it).

So far I've seen this on enforcer and trader type mobs.

Well, unfortunately, I don't believe MOBs should even be able to cast Last Word at all. lol Maybe it was taken out of the nuke rotation, I'm not sure (never seen it myself)...but there's no way an insta-kill attack should exist for regular MOBs--even bosses. That's just stupid.

At any rate, even if we did asume it was a QL +10, that puts the boss at level 151. This is a QL 175ish nano we're talking about here. Why is a level 151 mob casting a QL 175 nano? Why are they casting a QL 175 NUKE, when Nukes should be maintained at lower than level QL to maintain balance in the slightest bit?

Also, as mentioned, all MOBs nuke at once. This is really, really bad/cheap in boss rooms. 1 strong nuke is one thing...maybe avoidable if you have Layered Protection, HP buffs, and good HP in general. (Not to mention a quick healer.) But getting hit by 2 at the same time? 3? 4? Impossible.

In general, I have notice a lot more nukeing recently. I guild-mate at level 84 was killed by a green NT/Crat with 2000 points of energy damage this evening. TWO TIMES IN A ROW. (That being, he went back to the mission and suffered the same fate.) I don't think he even had 2000 HP. This MOB was no more than level 72 or so--casting a freakin' 2000 point nuke!! That's just absurd. Energy damage, too...so refer to my previous post about the nano in question.

Again, that's Cascade of the Storm or Rule of One in a QL 81 mission on a level ~72 MOB.

I was hit by a insta-1700 point nuke two nights ago by a crat. Of course, it was insta-cast and was surrounded by 2 or 3 hits on either side. I didn't stand a chance. There's no way you can stay at 100% health the whole time during a fight. Anywhere near 60% life (as a normal point of HP in battles), and you're toast from these various nukes.

Angelus0001... 
As Maxtor said. No, calms do not function properly. However, calms seem to work better in solo missions for some reason, while they are totally borked in team missions still.

Mursamune @ 7/30/2002 8:57:35 PM (41322):
I've noticed this on all types of mobs since 14.4.

I run into a room, calm a mob, stand there for a few seconds, then the mob starts attacking me.  If they dont notice you immediatly after you calm them, they dont calm.  I orginally though this was because of the new adv calms (I'm a trader) to give them a sorta grace period so their calms would be more effective, but from what you're saying it's not.  

This could be a bug.  Maybe funcom's way of cutting down on calm blitzing.  It could be a lagg between server and client, but I never had this before 14.4, and I havent noticed anymore lagg than normal since then.

Edit:  Also noticed when this happens, the calm only acts as a root.

CheeseNips @ 7/31/2002 12:15:32 AM (zoning and loosing 1/4-1/2 of my hp 41471):
I've run into a rather odd bug more than a few times.  When I zone I will loose 1/4-1/2 of my total hitpoints.  I think the hp that "disapears" is all of my hp from buffs/gear.  I have been able to recreate it and belive I have figured out the cause of the problem.  

The dot from one-more-hit-healing.  It's only a 5 point dot, but when I have it on me and zone (after zoneing previously with some damage and healing up from it) my hitpoints vanish.

The only workaround I've been able to come up with is.. well... wait the 10 seconds for the dot to go away.  Not a BIG DEAL bug, but one that is kind of a pain.

Yeah, that's it they do seem like roots.

I didn't start noticing this untill a few days ago. Could be because I didn't use them very much before recently when I've done alot of solo missions.

By the way, they are all deep orange/red mobs (again probably bacause I've only done those mobs the past few days...). Is there some kind of timed check on the calms? Like on MOBS discovering you while sneaking or the lockpicks?

Tenkx @ 7/31/2002 4:12:32 PM (38880):
I though I was being stupid.. I have frequently collected what I thought were 3 missions in a zone (often rolling 100's of mission to find 3 with location/item combinations that I like). 

I think I have 3 missions so I head off to do them only to find that I only have 1 or 2. This has happened so often that it cannot just be me. 

I use Windows XP.

Tenkx @ 7/31/2002 4:17:21 PM (40569):
I have also noticed that on Opifex faces "Keelar Sunglasses" do not look good. They sit right on the end of an Opt's nose making them look like grandma with here reading glasses on.

This is not so bad because Kataras look pretty cool but it would be nice if the Keelars looked as good on opi's as they do on Solitus.

Tenkx @ 7/31/2002 4:23:37 PM (40543):
Belts an NCUs are a bit wierd to equip, did you check the following:

1.   Your old belt and NCUs are un-equipped. Unequipping the belt forces the NCUs to unequip. There is a little progress bar at the top left of the screen to show you how the unequip is going. It takes about 1min maybee 90 secs for this to happen. Do not zone while this is happening.

2.   When the old belt is unequipped right click the new belt in you inventory. So long as you have the skill for the belt the same progress bar at the top left of the screen will start (another 1 min I think). Don't click anything or zone while this is happening. In fact I think if you right click the belt again you see a message like "Please wait" and it actually then takes about 2 minutes to leave you without a belt. 

So long as you remember that the belt takes 1 min to take off and 1 min to put on (I think that each NCU deck upgrade takes 20 seconds to put on) it should work. I have certainly changed belts a lot of times.

Specialone @ 7/31/2002 4:50:10 PM (35110):
Same thing happened to me, but in my case i was soloing a ql 100ish team mission and I had just killed the boss and LOOTED him (but i hadnt completed the mission yet) when the server crashed. Upon relogging, i found myself again in the boss room with a NEW boss (different name) and two helpers. I hit the elevator and found 2 mobs above that I had to dispatch. 

I returned to the boss room, killed all the mobs and looted the boss again 

Approx 50% of the loot was identical to the first loot, but it was 100% junk.

Docmax @ 7/31/2002 6:25:30 PM (37181):
is the server lag still there after last night's emergency fix?

FireC @ 7/31/2002 6:25:30 PM (40543):
If I remember right you also can't put those on straight from the bag, they need to be in the inventory.

IronTide @ 7/31/2002 10:20:14 PM (35110):
Yeah, it's a server crash that causes mission mob resetting.

My observations are:

1) All chest's respawn identically (loot and trapped/locked status).

2) All normal mobs respawn identically (loot, type, level, etc etc blah blah)

3)  Boss has different name, same type.  I would presume different loot.

IronTide @ 7/31/2002 10:26:30 PM (38880):
I've noticed this only happens when I continue to examine the rest of the missions after selecting the one I want.

Here's when I get the poof:

1) Examine mission
2) Select mission
3) Examine other missions (and/or mission rewards)
4) Click accept mission


If you do that, try this: close your 'examine' window.  Select a different mission.  Reselect the missions you actually want.  Click 'accept mission'.

What I think is happening is that examining a different mission deselects your selection.

Anyhow, give it a shot and see if that helps.

Agent Smith @ 8/1/2002 1:04:17 AM (38880):
They introduced this bug with the mission booth change that will only spawn 3 find item missions if you don't have any, 2 find item missions if you have 1 and 1 find item mission if you have 2.  I hope someone understands what I mean, as I can't remember what patch it was.

In any case I have petitioned about this a few times and all I got basically was "yeah we know about it but too fricken bad".  It has to be one of the most annoying bugs EVER.

I think this picture sums up my feelings about it

Acektg @ 8/1/2002 9:31:01 AM (41322):
I just noticed this playing yesterday.  My lvl 137 trader was running through a lvl 137 mission to get the reward for a guildmember.  about 10% of the mobs in the mission would ignore the calms.  Now, my trader had the top two drains running and was casting the top trader calm on all the mobs.  The mob would stop attacking and get the brown shimmering visual effect but would soon attack me afterwards when I was in the next room.   It also did work as a root...the mob could not move at all but still was targeting me and shooting me when I returned to that room to recalm.  The second time I calmed those mobs, they did remain calmed.  

I mentioned this to my guild and they suggested that the calms were breaking.  Now, I dont wear bracers when I calm missions due to the fact that they often break the calms.  I also tried to cast a lower ql calm to see if it had broken and I got the "better program already running" message.  

This is very annoying especially when I am 5 rooms past that mob and I have to go back and recalm every mob just to let me use a treatment kit

I mean I am not complaining...but.

Ashuras @ 8/2/2002 2:41:27 AM (40800):
Casters are dangerous. Must always kill them fast (it's possible due to their low hp).

Or... get soldiers, fully buffed with all kinds of survival stuff to go up 1st with MK on. Other people won't survive.

The worst type of boss is not the NT type, coz at least they are killable.

The worst, IMO, are huge enforcer types who have insane hp, crits for 1.5k EVERY hit at insane speed as well.

My team finally killed it after a long long fight becoz we used a slayer to tank, with MP healing the slayer. Else... I wouldn't be the only casualty.

Bionitrous @ 8/2/2002 4:02:49 AM (40800):
They absolutely have to fix the all mobs nuking at once crap in the boss room at a minimum.  I'm guessing they have one or at the most two timers that tick for the entire mission.  When it ticks, they do a nano.  Not bad when you are going room to room.

But in the boss room with 4 NT's or Bothackers al focused on one player, it's kind of stupid and ultimately unfair to the players to have to suffer from a code streamlining technique like that.

Krneki @ 8/2/2002 8:24:11 AM (41755):

Are you set at full AGG?  My dodge and evade is maxed, duck is about 100 points lower, and I set my agg/def bar to 60% agg.  I RARELY ever get critted.  Now, if I'm set full AGG, I notice a big difference with criticals.

Pluteaux @ 8/2/2002 5:35:05 PM (41755):
One thing I love about being a trader is that, after doing ransack skills and deprive skills, my shotgun skill goes way up giving me a higher chance of getting crits. That's why I use a Windchaser shotgun--great crits. I get crits over 800 againts red mobs, and I'm only level 47. My shotgun is QL 77 and only OE prior to running Shotgun Experience. Maybe you should start a trader--if you can't beat them, join them.

Mystika @ 8/2/2002 6:19:08 PM (41755):
Evades have absolutely nothing to do with crits at all.

They only increase your chance of dodging an attack. There is no way to stop a crit. If they have a 75% chance of crit then they will crit whether or not you have high evades.

But I do agree that most mobs crit way too often.

Tiran @ 8/2/2002 6:38:52 PM (41755):
Er, yes, evades affect crits.

When the system does its attackers-attackvalue/yourevadevalue, higher figures cause higher crit chances.  The base chance is (supposedly) 3%, but if you have a much higher attack value than the defender's defense, the chance is higher.

And being missed now does affect whether you get critted.  It was recently changed so that you cannot crit without hitting first, so you have your crit% chance of a successful attack turning crit, now.

At least, that's the way Funcom explained it.   Actual code may vary.  (Are you suprised?)

The other day I lost link while walking through the grid and this bug became more than just a minor annoyance.

Nianna @ 8/2/2002 7:48:33 PM (41322):
Reflection spells definitely can break calms even when it doesn't appear that a monster has even attacked you.  Don't get any reflect buffs or use reflect bracers when you are casting calm.

The only other time calm fails for me is if I cast calm on something then run out of the room quickly before the spell takes effect.  If the monster can't see you when its time for the calm to take effect he will often stay aggro (but be rooted apparently) and you have to go back and recalm him.

Brad, STL/MO @ 8/2/2002 8:03:01 PM (Cloaking Device Bug 42094):
If I'm wearing a Cloaking Device, no player character can see me. (OK, the few with really high perception can, but you know what I mean.) But I just found out yesterday even Epicine can tell I'm there, alright. Why?

Because the damage I take from it gets announced in vicinity chat. For almost as far as if I was shouting!

Excuse me, but for role-playing reasons (stakeouts, etc.) I want to be able to use a Cloaking Device to shadow other players, and so on. Not much chance of that, is there? Similarly, I wouldn't mind being able to use it to hide in PvP areas, only taking it off if the opponents looked survivable. Wouldn't do much good, would it? Heck, not only does it announce that there's a cloaked person, it announces their name, so everybody in the area can "/tell helpbot whois" and find out who it is, what level they are, and so on.

If you can't switch that message to self-only, then take it out of the game. As little damage as it is, I don't need it spammed to me every few seconds, anyway - I know it's there, and I can see my health bar just fine, thank you. (Besides, I'd know how much I was taking anyway; I typically have a long HoT up during.)

I know I'm asking for a lot here, but can I get some kind of a response from Funcom out of this, ASAP? Here, I'll give you a form letter, please pick one. Thanks!

[ ] Yes, every player character within 40 meters is supposed to know that someone is using a Cloaking Device. We have no plans to change this at this time.

[ ] Valid point, we'll put it in the list. No firm date for when it will be fixed, though.

[ ] Valid point. I talked to the developers, and it looks pretty easy; we'll try to get it into 14.6.

[ ] We have no plans to address this at this time.

Yep, and everyone who wants to try a funny way to make sure its FunCom's server:

1. Go to a newbie holoworld (starting area)
2. Kill a Reet of Paradise
3. If after you achieve 0% HP and the bird for about half a second does nothing then you get the message "A reet of paradise tried to hit you but missed" then the server is getting lag. 

Three new toons I rolled only to see this happen all the time. Kill a reet and then die myself due to ghost damage. Really its all the time try it you'll be amazed at it. If I were the guy in charge of employees I would tape a lovely pink slip in the IT depts lockers at FunCom. This is stupid.

Grymvarg @ 8/3/2002 12:51:43 PM (40543):
And if rightclicking doesn't help, pick up the new belt after the progressbar has disappeared and drop it on yourself in the equipmentscreen. I've had much trouble with belts especially, and .. well, if it doesn't work the first time, zone and try again.

rickenbacker @ 8/4/2002 10:49:25 PM (41755):
I can understand how the delay between being told I can use something and actually being allowed to could be due to lack of synchronisation between my computer and the server, though I can't understand why that's the case. The "Please wait for your previous AAARRRGHHHH!!!!!! <frantic hammering on special attack key>" bug can't really be because of that, though, it almost always works the first time you special attack a mob, but subsequent ones during the same fight take a varying amount of time (and annoyed keypresses) to go through, if they ever do. This isn't just annoying and stupid, it also kills people needlessly. 

Oh yeah, what's up with the camera in the "subway" style missions anyway?

Scorus @ 8/5/2002 6:20:01 PM (Calms really are broken! 42539):
All,

As per:
http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sho...threadid=39545

and

http://forums.anarchy-online.com/sho...threadid=41932

It is true, calms are broken. I know that a lot of you have calmed with no problems, but under certain conditions the mobs will continue attacking even after they have successfully been calmed. Or, as Meister has experienced, they will attack you later from several rooms away and you will not be able to heal.

This can happen when you mez something and you never get the "Attacked by..." message. The mob will be encased in the glow and you will get a successful nano execution message but the mez will not in fact be working. Two effects can occur:

If you stay in that room long enough for the mob to notice you then it will start attacking you. Successive calms or charms will not work UNLESS you first spoil the first calm with an attack. So you can nuke the mob and then calm it successfully.

If you do not stay in that room long enough for the mob to notice you then it will still attack you but not until you are several rooms away. You will then lose the ability to use healing kits and do other things that you can't do when under attack.

Since this is predicated on the mob not seeing you until after you have cast the nano, it is most likely going to affect you when you are alone (or at least separated from your party), when you have a relatively high NanoInit and when you are moving quickly. It is more likely to affect the higher level mezzers who have the higher perceptions and NanoInits and who tend to mez through a mission quickly.

Note: in the case of this particular bug, the calm is still present on the attacking mob (i.e. he is still glowing). In cases where the calm has actually been disrupted, that is another bug entirely.

Scorus

Hypos @ 8/5/2002 8:24:44 PM (mob with 0 hp bug 42561):
Well, I've heard of players with the 0 hp bug, but this weekend I saw it on a mob.

I was soloing with my level 40 MP.  About halfway through a large mission in Stret East, I started receiving ghost damage.  I ran for the exit.  But before I zoned, my attack pet was able to get the aggro and before long the mob was dead.  I looted and continued on.  The following mob, however, appeared to be at 0 hp right from the start of the fight.  Everything else about the fight seemed normal.  The mob didn't take noticeably more or less time to kill than others in the mission.  But throughout the entire fight, it appeared to be at 0 hp.  So, in this case, the 0 hp bug was merely a visual glitch.

Because of this, I'm thinking that maybe the ghost damage bug somehow sets up the 0 hp bug.

[edit] made a couple corrections

Docmax @ 8/5/2002 9:25:51 PM (37181):
Yes, the server lock-up is still there.

I played a mission this weekend and the server locked up many times for serveral seconds.

Ylara @ 8/5/2002 11:51:20 PM (Dieing after a fight 42607):
I am so sick of losing half a lvl or more due to the so-called ghost hits. Mob will be long dead, you have your xps and then you die by getting hit repeatedly by a dead mob. I really wish you would get this fixed, it is extremely annoying and it is interfering more than a little with my game play experience.

At this point in time, I am NOT a happy customer.

phil @ 8/6/2002 3:30:40 AM (42094):
Ive also had this problem, its stupid that the spam is there at all, really.  I was in rompa the other day with it on, and everyone was yelling at me for spamming... so crappy and it doesnt even make logical sense.. the one I have does less damage than my NATURAL HEALING repairs!  There is no reason in the world why I should have to see that in the chat!

Sean-Roach @ 8/6/2002 8:01:42 AM ("timewarp" like effect at the waterfall 42649):
On the last mission I did, (second to third by the time you're likely to have read this), I had to go to some mesa SouthEast of Athen, where there is a 100% suppression zone, a spring and a waterfall.  "tent leading underground", was the description on my mission-key.

Anyway, after completing, I "decided" to take whatever real path existed to get back down, (read, didn't want to fall to my death, trying to rappel down the side of the cliff I climbed to get there.)

I found a tunnel that leads down to the base of the waterfall, but at a certain point, I always found myself at the top again, and swimming at the edge.

I finally "swam" down the cascade, but thought you'd like to know the bug was there.

Necron99 @ 8/6/2002 3:37:04 PM (42397):
Old bug, actually I thought they fixed it. You can't use colored text (i.e. the blue text of an item link) with a % variable. It crashes AO and always has.

Docmax @ 8/6/2002 5:43:48 PM (37181):
I played a couple missions last night with my L 18 fixer.  My wife played with me with her L 18 Adventurer.  I only noticed the lag on my wife's end because she was doing a lot of healing and I was just letting my gun shoot.

Which just points out that not everyone will know, unless they know what to look for, but the lag was horrendous last night.

Did a router go bad at FunCom's ISP 10 weeks ago?

runey @ 8/6/2002 5:46:29 PM (42649):
Did you try coming in from the other way? Heh heh heh. Seriously, it used to work (you go through the waterfall...I usually call the place "the hidden city"), then got broken with 14.4. Hopefully they'll fix it sometime soon. It's a cool way to get in and out, usually.

PleaseNo! @ 8/6/2002 6:47:24 PM (Biggest bugs and solutions 42725):
These are the biggest problems in the game effecting the largest portion of players I believe.  Yes pet pathing problems exist, but they only effect a specific class in specific circumstances.  They are a big deal for that class, but these problems are bigger.  This is an honest attempt to identify problems in the game and suggest real solutions.  If you disagree with any portion of this post please feel free to state your opinion in a constructive manner giving real evidence of why you disagree.  Simply stating an opinion is not acceptable.  One should at least construct a scenerio to support your arguement.  

If you agree or disagree with these problems lets here about it so that the games designers take notice!

Now onto the problems:

BUG 1) Spells canceling when consecutive attempts to cast occur.
Solution 1) NEVER cancel a spell when another attempt to cast that same spell is made.

===========================================

BUG 2) "In a fight" message happens when your not in a fight.

This is very annoying in Boss rooms, when NPC's are far far away, when leaving the arena etc and so on....

Solution 2) If you have not taken damage in N seconds then you are not in a fight.  

===========================================

BUG 3) One can cast negative spells on themselves, yet can't shoot or hit themselves.

Solution 3)  Do not allow "negative" effects to be cast on yourself!  Its the same code as if you were going to cast on a team member for crying out loud!

===========================================

BUG 4) Roots are broken by spells that do not do any damage.  Casting an inexperience on yourself shouldn't break a root.

Solution 4) Only allow spells cast by someone else to break a root and spells that do damage.  Except obviously for the spells that are specifically made to break a root.

===========================================

BUG 5) Concealment appears to be broke in that one can have very high concealment and be detected by those who have no investment into perception.

Solution 5) Here is what I suggest:
A.) Movement by the concealed should lower their effective concealment.
B.) Range from a "detector" should play a factor with longer distances increasing the chance of hiding and in your face hiding being almost impossible.
C.) There should be ACTIVE revealing and PASSIVE revealing.
C.1.) Active revealing uses the full perception skill.
C.2.) When revealed actively the hiders concealment skill should drop to zero for N seconds.
C.3) Passive detection uses a percentage of your perception skill (< 50%).
C.4) Passive detection will reveal the hider to the person detecting them and no one else.
C.5) No text message will be generated on a passive detect.
C.6) Passive checks should be on a slow timer or done once when the target enters the detectors range.
D.) The perception and concealment skills when used should be modified randomly from 85% to 115% when used in formula's.  This introduces an element of chance.  The philosophy being that someone with 91 perception should not always detect someone with 90 concealment.  Or someone with 91 concealment always hides from a 90 perception person.

Suggested formulae:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
rndChance= random (0.85, 1.15)

if (moving) then 
movement = SOME_VALUE_LESS_THAN_ONE
else
movement = 1
end if

effective concealment = (concealment * rndChance);
effective concealment = effective concealment * movment

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

rndChance = random(0.85,1.15)

effective active reveal = rndChance * perception
effective active reveal = effective active reveal  + (PercentageByDistance(distance) * perception)
effective passive reveal = 0.5 * effective active reveal 

Note: PercentageByDistance returns a value from 5 to 0 where distance being low returns a bigger number and distance being far returns a smaller one.

Borrace @ 8/6/2002 7:24:53 PM (42539):
it's true...

i /petitioned it last night.  you run the calm, the mob gets the calm glow, then it starts attacking you.  VERY annoying.

Anyhow, give it a shot and see if that helps. 
			
		
	
This does not work. I have tried every possible combination, from selecting the mission and clicking "Accept" right away, to looking at different ones, to selecting the mission and clicking "Accept" five minutes later. All to no avail. If the booth decides to not let you have the mission, it doesn't matter what silly hokus-pokus you try on it, it still won't give it to you.

Oh, and by the way, IT'S STILL HAPPENING!!! PLEASE FIX IT!!!

Big bump on this, it is really winding me up a lot. You spend a long time looking for a long sought mission item then you don't get the mission. Please fix this.

Ylara @ 8/7/2002 10:38:38 AM (Poor nubis 42872):
Having recently started a trader I often go to the backyards to find something to deprive and ransack before casting a high tradeskill buff or a wrangle and oh the joy of trying to get back out. My record so far is spending 5 minutes trying to zone out of the backyard (not initiated on server, retreat or try again). For me this is an annoyance but I know I will get out of there eventually. 

I'm thinking about the poor people who start their first char there... They don't know what's going on. I suggest you get the zone point done properly as people are not going to be very impressed with the backyard after lvl 3 or so; they are going to want to get out of the yard and go exploring. 

Atm is is annoying, difficult etc... I think the nubis could do with a bit of help there, I know I wouldn't have wanted that sort of problem starting out, everything was new and if even zoning is an issue I would not be too inclined to stay with a game.

Ylara.

Roe @ 8/7/2002 10:39:24 AM (38880):
I have experience the same thing ... press accept, but no mission. Lately, however, it hasn't happened, and maybe it is because I:
reselect the mission I want (select another first)view mission descriptionpress the accept button for around half a sec or more.
Although I haven't tried to reproduce the bug, it is my feeling that it is the last item above that actually ensures my mission, or in other words, that pressing the accept button too quickly may close window but not give mission. If that is true, I would figure it is lag-dependent just like when sometimes your attack or sit button presses are lost by the server due to lag. It may be that accept button press always closes the window (local client event), but if done too quickly the server may loose the event (remote server event). Well, I'm just guessing here ...

Ylara @ 8/7/2002 10:41:35 AM (38880):
I agree completely... I normally find it the most annoying when in a team... you are trying to find 3 for the same location (more or less) and end up having to find 5 as the buggers do not get accepted.

Abstract @ 8/7/2002 1:42:29 PM (Bliss RK2 42902):
I am having continuing disconnect and crash problems in Bliss on RK2, this has been ongoing for about 2 weeks and seems centered on the area around the city.

Seriously, 1/2 the time I will leave the city and my postion will get reset 3 or 4 times.

This is the only zone in which this happens to me.

I have been playing of and on since the first week of relese so I would not be posting if I had not gone thru all the normal stuff.

I think this is on the server.

Also, the Scorps are kind of bugged around there.

Several times I have ended up dead after beening attacked by a green scrops and argoed by 10 grays.

They respawn really fast and the time lag is really really bad.

Also, I am sick of this...attacked by green scorp...droped...come back dead but not dead ( no inv, but still at mission loc, but can't zone into mission no key....attacked again...dead for real...xp gone...FC NEVER NOT ONCE returning XP, EVER, even tho they have a log...I am tried of reloging dead.

Again only in Bliss.

This is more then some server bug.

It smells of bored sadistic sysop.

I see smerking this trying to gain insite into the human mind, some kind of channeling of a druken coke ridden siggy.


Anyway, this is intentional.

You got some kind of sysop perv messing with people in Bliss.

I can sence the mind behind it.

This whole game is a Psyop run by a bunch of red-hats.

Which is kind of neet, but frustracting in terms of the Hubris of the GMs, given they don't really have a model for consciouness.

It's got nothing to do with the timers running at different speeds, thats just a funcom way of avoiding investigating the problem. Different speed timers accounts for the fact that treatment kits, rechargers, specials and everything else doesnt time exactly with when you get the message "treatment skill available" or "brawl available" but still have to wait a second or two. Thats fine I can live with that.

The real problem is when you can't use your special for 20, 30, 40 or even more seconds after you get the message - the only thing that seems to clear it is restarting combat.

It's not even hard to replicate the problem just get any weapon with a special attack (by the way fast attack is far more likely to do it than brawl).

I agree, alot of times I can t launch a Full auto long after getting availability message, only way to fix is stop attack and and then use it. 

Not a question of timing either,  I started a combat, after first shot on mob, got FA available message. I had time to use MK 10 twice and still couldn t FA. I stop fight and then press FA and bam, works!

But I do agree that most mobs crit way too often. 
			
		
	

crits are dependant on three things:

1) your attack rating;
2) any crit modifiers you have; and 
3) the evade settings of your opponent.

the higher you have 1 and 2, and the lower your opponent has 3, the more likely you are to crit.

Wrong.  There is something wrong with the way petitions are being handled.  I was stuck in a mission, I petitioned STUCK IN MISSION.  Had 7 petitions in front of me at the time.  30 minutes later, I had 0.  35 minutes later I had 1 in front of me.  So I petitioned STUCK IN MISSION again, and 2 minutes later the ARK finally showed up.

Ya know, those 'stuck' petitions used to take only 2 minutes to be answered..

Any ideas?

My guess is that this is a cheap programming workaround for bad NPC pathing. Instead of having the mob wandering around in circles, not finding you because of a small rock or a bump in the landscape, it will intstamove 30-40 metres. Cant you at least put in 4-5 seconds lag before they instamove please dear Funcom )

My understanding of the petitions is that you are put into a Queue.

The ARKs/GMs then look at all the petitions and re-arrange them according to severity.

Take a look at: http://ark.anarchy-online.com/php/pet_info.php

It states the following:


	
		
			
			
				Examples:

/petition stuck petition_message

/petition exploit petition_message

/petition disruption petition_message

/petition petition_message
(The petition will be classified based on the information contained in the petition text.)


As always, it is important to give full details in your petition so that Advisors and GMs are better able to assist you.

Time-critical issues will be given top priority, but please do not give false or misleading information in a petition in order to receive faster service. This is a violation of policy (attempting to defraud a CS representative) and it wastes time that is better spent helping those in need.
			
		
	
So from my understanding that is why your "Petitions in front of you" number changes.  They have manual control over when the petition is serviced.

This is all assumption from presented information obviously, but it seems logical to me.

I personally have been helped within 2 or 3 minutes when I have used "Disruption" at the front of my petition, when I has having problems with 5 million fixer items on the ground before the patch, or with someone being a racist or whatever, and it stated that I had 20 petitions up on me...  so obviously they can pick and choose...

I died twice last night because of this

1) At the end of the Longest Road, by those ruins. Some bug thing aggroed me. I thought i was fine, though, since I was buffed up to run speed 1030 or so and there was no way it could catch me. It hit me a few times as i approached and passed it, but I quickly escaped its attack range. I went into third person camera mode to watch it steadily fall further and further behind...then all of a sudden it appeared /right/ behind me and killed me in a couple hits.


2) Trying to get to Pleasant Meadows through Omni territory. Got aggroed by a Ninja Droid and started to run for my life. Ran across a bridge, and just as I made it to the center I jumped off into the water. The ninja droid was stuck up top, running against the railing of the bridge, while I swam downstream a ways and got back onto shore. I turned around, and was about to gloat to my team that id just made a daring escape when the droid dissapeared off the bridge, appeared right in front of me, and wiped me out in a couple hits.

The Waterfall tunnel in to Rising Sun (go under the waterfall and then you should be in a tunnel that leads up the mountain) is broke.

Basically no matter how you enter the waterfall you end up swimming up it not going through it. its fine as you can get to the top but the tunnel would be preferable to swimming up a waterfall :-)

I love rising sun its a great mission haunt, this however soils it a little. i am not sure when this happened but the only thing i can possibly link with it is the new water that was added last patch (or patch before).

2. In all my 5 years of playing games online our ISP is less than 5% at fault. It is always either heavy internet traffic, a relay post somewhere in tin-buck-too just died, or the server at your destination just died. 

So the next time an ARK or GM tries to claim ISP tell em to shove it. It's just an excuse to get you off their petition board. 
			
		
	
Ok sorry, I have to reply to the very first part of your post. Before I reply let me make 1 thing perfectly clear. I am not excusing funcom for some of the mistakes they make, or their bad server performance. My argument is with this stupid and badly thought out post. 

To address point 1 of your post. 

This is possibly the worst test I have EVER heard of.

There is a concept on the Internet known as routing, just because you can fire up a web browser and get to google or yahoo does not mean you can route to Funcoms servers. 

Isp's "peer" with each other in order to create a Internet back bone, some isp's peer with more than 1 other isp. So, depending exactly where you are going to on the Internet, your route to that server (and therefore the networks you pass through) will be different. It’s even common for you to take different routes to the same server from one min to the next.

An easy way of demonstrating this is to open up a dos prompt and use the "tracert" command. 

This will show you what routers you pass through on the way to your destination.  For instance try doing "tracert www.microsoft.com" and then "Tracert www.google.com" you will see what I mean.

There are hundreds of other variables you can also take in to account in terms of internet performance, such as packet loss, ISP's with badly configured ACLs etc... Bare in mind it is not beyond the realms of possibility that an ISP between you and funcoms could be having any of the above issues or just simple network saturation..

Another thing to bare in mind is that HTTP (IE Web browsing) is a stateless protocol this mean that you request some thing off the server it just transfers you a load of data. Then the connection is closed until you want the next web page (i.e. click on another link). Gaming connections are generally statefull and require much more effort than a protocol like HTTP. Also HTTP in general transfers little data. Its txt and pictures, that’s it! So if an ISP between say you and google is having intermittent issues, then its quite possible you will get the first page but the second one would fail.

I am not saying that it is your isp that is causing the issue, nor am I trying to give funcom excuses for bad server performance. What I AM saying is your post is possibly the most inaccurate post regarding these technologies I have ever seen. It is your willingness to comment on subjects that you clearly know nothing about that has enraged me.

One of the main problems with this sort of game from an implementation point of view is all the variables involved. Lets say you do have bad server performance, but couple that with networking issues (that CAN NOT be controlled by funcom)... users get unhappy.

If you want to get on your high horse to a GM or an ARK then how about using a control (test) that is not complete and utter crap. (How about tracert'ing to funcoms servers and checking out what is really going on).

Now I am going to address point 2, given that point 1 was totally inaccurate, what basis do you have for diagnosing point 2???

Err…….. none me thinks. I believe the word I am looking for is "CLUELESS".

Aqua @ 8/14/2002 6:07:01 PM (37181):
tracert is a valid test? 
can we say load balancing? 
tracert isn't a good toubleshooting device for lag issues only dead paths.  Just because your trace route takes one path doesn't mean every packet sent to the server from the same machine takes the same path. His test is just as good as yours. the only true test is one where the server side is also activly recording turn around times through a direct monitoring circuit, which of course is unrealistic so some assumptions have to be made.

tracert isn't a good toubleshooting device for lag issues only dead paths.  Just because your trace route takes one path doesn't mean every packet sent to the server from the same machine takes the same path. His test is just as good as yours. the only true test is one where the server side is also activly recording turn around times through a direct monitoring circuit, which of course is unrealistic so some assumptions have to be made.

Seen as you seem to have a clue i will elaborate.

Tracert is not a great test but its a hell of a lot better than firing up a web browser,  for one you will get the time it takes to journey between your hops. (and generate packets with the correct source and destination, thats always helps  )

IE its a good way of ruling out your path to the server. and puting the blame soley on funcoms door (ok packet loss can't be detected easily with this method... but hey )

its not great but better than seeing if you can route to google.
So i fail to see your point.

I did say in my post that your packets could take a different route every time so whats your point ? (so you would have to perform the test lots in order to get a good reading... some major back bones statically route rather than dynamically).

and also like i said, i am not saying its not funcom issue. its just his test was compleate rubish.

Solo.
- Ps - you are quite correct about the only true test. and quite correct that it is unrealistic. so how about gather a little data rather than assuming all ? 

when you assume ... you make a ASS out of U and ME

Aqua @ 8/14/2002 6:29:34 PM (37181):
well since lag is mainly caused but packet loss or delay, I just don't think tracert is the right animal for the job. I would have to say that if his other stuff is working fine along with all the others posting the exact same problems from various areas of the world that would at least point more to the funcom side of the circuit and somthing they should be investigating.

~aqua

PS. when you are working blindly one on end of a circuit you have to assume to get anywhere. 

..edited to add PS to answer other PS

OH... my.... god!

Let me bow down and smash the feet of a guy who could not read between the lines of my post. Dear god I might get struck down with wrath of the network admin. Jesus man!

Point #1
I said this because in the man's original post the ARK's kept on saying it might be his ISP that is causing the lag. For a quick test not the accurate thorough one that takes maybe 10minutes to correctly test (ie tracert or ping -t) open a browser and test your ISP's connection to the internet. If your web pages are caching and popping up in your browser within expected time restraints why not think there is a problem on FunCom's end.


There is a concept on the Internet known as routing, just because you can fire up a web browser and get to google or yahoo does not mean you can route to Funcoms servers. 

Isp's "peer" with each other in order to create a Internet back bone, some isp's peer with more than 1 other isp. So, depending exactly where you are going to on the Internet, your route to that server (and therefore the networks you pass through) will be different. It’s even common for you to take different routes to the same server from one min to the next. 


Umm didnt I point out that the lag probably could be caused by a downed relay or router station somewhere between your ISP and FunCom's servers. Gee I think I did. As far as other tests how about 

www.dslreports.com
www."yourisppage".com
ping -t "URL"

especially 'ping -t' to one of FUnCom's servers. Keep it running while playing and then when you lag out alt+tab over to ur looping ping and see if there is lag? Then try tracert to that same server and detect where the dead path is. 

Just because I do not go down and write a damned essay on how to thoroughly test where the lag lies doesn't mean I don't know what I am talking about.

Docmax @ 8/14/2002 8:06:49 PM (37181):
I think a valid test is when you ask everyone in your guild (where people are from all over the world) "hey, did you just have a moment of 15 seconds of server lockup-lag?" and everyone says "yes".  Then you know it's centered at FunCom's servers, not in my ISP.

There is no doubt the server lock ups every 10 minutes is on FunCom's end.  

Where my doubt is, is if FunCom knows about it at all.

Magnuz @ 8/14/2002 8:07:07 PM (44582):
Oki, so ive tried to play the game afterall now, but there is SO MUCH lag, and not from me (my client), my ping is 170, but the server is lagging insanely... If i press my shortcut key to use a general buff, it takes 3-4 secs before it even reacts....
Let me guess, memory leak (there was a crash) or something silly... This is unplayable

 

Please fix this

Magnuz @ 8/14/2002 8:19:34 PM (44582):
Does the FC bugfixers/developers check these messages?? A reply with, ive read it would be nice. We like to be heard, not just sending messages into a black hole....

Ahh, now there you go ... 

A post you have clearly thought about. (no pun intended)

I get rather anoyed at all of the posts that slag funcom with no thought. You have to admit your post did look like (well to me at least) someone who was "jumping on the band wagon" and had not thought about what he had said. 

Agreed i did'nt read between the lines, but that's because this forum if full of people who speak first and think later (me inculded at times). 

This post is well thought out and explains what you mean. I am very much of the school of if you dont have anything quality to say don't say anything. I am not talking about right and wrong, just the ability to show someone has thought about what they are saying.

and oh.. " Just because I do not go down and write a damned essay on how to thoroughly test where the lag lies doesn't mean I don't know what I am talking about. " 

how am i supposed to know that ??? ;p 

look if i offended you..  sorry. I cant really say anymore than that. but as i say harsh comments that appear to have no thought get to me.

So there you go. :-) I seem to have got a reaction from you ... and you know what ? its the right one.

I agree that is a vaild test.

Shyenia @ 8/14/2002 10:24:11 PM (37181):
I can also be blamed for assuming that people already know what I am talking about and thus just post short comments on things.  

Ack I am guilty lol.

One thing I would liket to start here as well is that I believe that 56k users are subject to a constant 3 second delay between client/server. I need to get back to my cable modem and try out the lag then. If it's true that 56k users are getting shafted then I can post a very very long post on what is going on.

Theotus @ 8/14/2002 10:38:16 PM (37181):
Well for what its is worth, here is my experiance of what is happening. (for me)

I run a 512k DSL connection, for the most part my anarchy experiance is a good one. However i think has a lot to do with how i play the game. 

I spend most of my time out of citys and not in missions i am really in to out door exploring (on foot) and hunting.

However i have found Missions more laggy than i would have expected and whenever i am in a city its pretty bad (in fact i stay out of tir and stick to athen unless looking for a mission team).

When i have experianced bad lag i have checked my traces and pings (i have only done this quickly so its not very conclusive) , Basically i get good times right up and till i hit funcoms front door.

Then it all goes the way of the pear :-( , just a thought (and this is pure speculation, I wonder how maxed out the processors on the clusters are, rubi-ka must handle a hell of a lot of traffic.

I never experiance bad preformace that has any pattern to it other than going in to a city, but with citys the spec of my machine prolly does not help. (only a 1 gig p3 with a geforce2)

Backyard zoning is horrible!

Rogoff @ 8/15/2002 12:42:37 AM (37181):
I saw this post in another thread...

	
		
			
			
				The same here, even chat is affected (about 5sec delay till a shout is displayed in Tir at a ping of 150-170).
Reorganizeing items into/out of backpacks/inventory, zoneing into buildings, player and NPC spawning, ... takes about 15sec.
Not really playable at the moment.
			
		
	
Assuming the servers are working speedily, a 150 ping should NOT result in a 5 second chat lag. A 4000+ ping might do it, but not 150.

This isn't a network issue.

What this scenario says to me is that the server took ~4850 milliseconds to process a /shout request - in other words, the servers are overloaded as hell.

Vendors of these games will tell you that patch XXX addressed lag, when that is in fact impossible - unless they patched their routers. What a speed patch can (and usually does) do is optimize server-side processing and POSSIBLY tweak the netcode.

I would be 0% percent surprised if Funcom is claiming ISP problems when in actuality they are cursed with insufficient capacity.

Chace @ 8/15/2002 5:29:51 AM (37181):
But if that's the case, why aren't we all having these problems?

I can't tell you the last time I had a problem with ghost damage, in missions or outside. I've never experienced most of the problems I'm seeing described in this thread.

I'm not saying they don't exist: clearly they do, or you'd all be playing instead of posting. But if we were experiencing server overload, wouldn't everyone WITHOUT EXCEPTION be experiencing the same problem?

I play on RK2, and I have a cable modem.

Not necessarily. Unless Funcom has decided to revive the Cray market, they've probably got one server for each outdoor zone, and a couple for mission tech. I'm certain I've been fine in Old Athen when Tir crashed, for example.

But I have to agree with you in principle. Barring some bizarre situation where your threads consistently get higher priority than mine, everyone in a zone would experience server load effects.

It's probably multiple problems. Server load, funcom's network, local ISP's and client load. TBH, I'm glad I'm not the guy that has to "fix" it.

BTW, I play on RK2, fast DSL, Athlon 1.2 and Geforce4. I still get phantom damage, warping etc. Really odd that you don't.

Villianic @ 8/15/2002 10:40:02 AM (Trading bug - items in each player's window is different 44770):
I team up with two other friends & we do team missions together. We keep comming up with the same problem once in a while.

I was giving my friend a QL Tsak for him to use. I opened a trade window with my one friend, put a QL Tsak rifle in the window, yet it showed up as flamethrower ammunition in his window. After the trade completed, he had the flamethrower ammunition in his inventory. He then handed it back to me and it was still flamethrower ammunition. 

Somehow the Tsak turned into flamethrower ammunition. After the missions were over, and I was selling the unuseable loot, the QL 9 Tsak was then again in my inventory.

Another problem, the 3rd friend had a pistol just POOF on her. She was trying to dual wield it with a Sword, worked for a bit, but then poofed shortly after. No sign of it anywhere, and has never reappeared.

They always complain about various other inventory problems when we're missioning as well. I started telling them to just wait until we zone out to deal with inventory & trading mission loot.

With them being noob level, and me playing my low level alt, this isn't TOO troublesome, but I'd hate to see this with higher end loot.

Greygal @ 8/15/2002 3:03:11 PM (A few bugs that need to be adressed 44808):
Hi
I dont know if this has been brought up before  (havent read this board so much)

1. Trade item bug in the shop.

This started when the timelimit thing introduced in patch 14.2.4 i think it was (2 sec timelimit for mission selection) but i think it also affect when we are in trade.
If i have a full bag of items and selling them in a shop, and i do check so i get credits for the items, then when iam done and zone out i usually have a few items left in my bag that i allready sold? This happends nearly all time but only if i trade directly from a bag ,not from inventory, and i can sell the item again and get dubble credits for it.

2. Attack and reload time.

This happends often in combat. Iam currently equiped whit a KIWD hunter crossbow that have 4 sec attack and 2 sec reload.
My rng init is around 780. But sometimes when my bow is about to reload nothing happends, I just stand there, it can take so much as up to 10-15 sec before iam able to fight back again and the bow is reloaded.
It seams that  when i try to reload and the timer that controlls it reset it self and start all over again and count but i dont get any message on the screen, No "attack bar" No message, I just stand there and wait and my ping is good so it is not a connection problem. 

3. Mobs hit twice while casting a program and interupt my attack.

This happends all the time when the mob is fighting whit  either ranged or melee attack. When they start to cast a program,, let it be heal , my attack is interupted and i cant hit them but no message that tells that  my attack is interupted.
And when the mob is finish i allways got hit twice from thier ranged or melee weapon and iam using shields but i only got counted for one shield attack.

Like this:
Your defelctionshield hit blabla for 104 damage
mob hit you for 340 proj dam
mob hit you for 340 proj dam

And this also goes for thos beetles bugs that is in some mission.
They often hit twice but my reflect hit only once.
And please remove thos beetles from mission , they are so bugged and so anoying to encounter. I dont get it why they have to have so huge mobs in missions that cant go true the doors, they are impossible to pull to another room. And they keep warping back all time or warping up in the roof etc.

4. Unequiping the yalmaha makes you small to others but not to your self.

This happends also a lot if u grid equiped in your jet and unequipe it later at some place. U will still have the scale % factor in your normal shape that is for the jet, and it only removes if u zone.

5. Not a bug but it need to be adressed. I have  an adv as main char and after the adv patch ( that added some good stuff for our proffession) there is still some thing that need to be tweaked.
I was thinking of the sharpen claws prg for an example. I have been using that prg only once just to find out its totaly useless.
It last for 30 sec and have a recharge time up to 4 minutes (correct me if iam wrong here) But for thos 30 sec it last it dosent add a thing ( nothing noticable)  to my attack skills, it is way to short time it is active and way to bad stats it adds to be usefull in combat.

Charm leet nanos are a fun thing but i have also only used it once. And i dont care to find the rest of the carm nanos like soleet etc. Just beuse i cant zone whit them. How fun is it to run out in the wilderness and charm a pet that u cant bring whit you?
And i want to be able to rename it also for the period of time i have controll over it. And also so i can make the leet talk ( I write what he shall say) Just thos basic pet commands.

Well thats it for this time. just wanted to share my thoughts on game issues that i think is broken.

Skyhigh @ 8/15/2002 5:03:31 PM (Mission Item missing, i want my reward ! 44841):
You know when you spend hours doing a missions (some dungeon are pretty big) making sure you reach 100% completetion to be sure to have your token and all that for nothing it's really annoying.

I contacted GM about that several time, i know they have a command they can use to check if the mission item spawned or not.    Unfortunatly that's the only thing they can do.... check.

I'd like GM to be able to end a mission (when it's at 100%) so that the player can get the reward.    Like i said, if i kill every single mob in the mission i want my reward !    It's not my fault if the item never spawned it's yours.    Just give GM a command allowing them to terminate a mission so the player can get the reward.

I'm only playing that game since 2 months but i have experienced this at least 10 times.

Are you absolutely sure those items were really sold? You checked the credits you had and added what trade window said to that? If you put too much things in the trade window there usually is some delay in it telling you you have put too much items in it and it returning them to your bags/inventory (which ever you took them from). If you click accept before it tells you you're selling too much stuff you may not get the message (not tried it so can't be sure).

If you really are getting too much credits you should report this in the game as well as by mail to FC as an exploit (in the game use "/petition exploit petition_message").

Greygal @ 8/15/2002 9:14:29 PM (44808):
Well iam sure about this coz it happends nearly everytime i do a trade whit stuff from a bag. 
I can get  around 3-6 sold item back in my bag when i zone. 
I have also tryed to drop the item at slow rate in the trade window and i never hit accept button if the text show up that i cant trade more items in one go.

And thos things i get back are things that are randomly sold. What i mean is that they dont show up in the order i sold them, it can be the first,  the 7 th, the 11 item etc.

Reason i brought this up is that i dont want to get cought by doing an exploit (if it is an exploit) i cant control. Its not my fault that i cant sell items as it supposed to do. And i cant just delete the items that show up in my bag even if i sold it once.

Iam sure that i get credits for the "unsold" item coz sometimes i have sold "rare" items just coz iam to lazy to sell it in a channel  and thos times i sell one of thos i allways check if i get credits and how much i get for it,, but sometimes when i zone out  ,, the item is still in my bag.

And i dont think this is an exploit coz i cant control it at all. It happend random and on random things. 
All things that is regard credits dosent have to be an exploit so i guess this falls under a game bug.

And for me it is just anoying to find out that items that i have allready sold is still in my bag

Almidara @ 8/15/2002 10:00:51 PM (44841):
I've never experienced what you are talking about. Most likely you are doing missions where you have to take the found item back to the mission terminal for the reward. 

If you are asked to find an item, and once you pick it up, nothing happens, this is the case. Simlpy return to the same exact mission terminal from which you got the mission, pick up the item and right click on the mission terminal. The mission will take a second to complete, but it will come. 

Usually in the mission description it will say something like, "Get the item and bring it back here..."

If this is not the case, post what kind of missions you are doing...get item, kill person, watch person, etc....

Almidara @ 8/15/2002 10:33:32 PM (37504):
I'd have to say if you rolled a 100 sided die 100 times and rolled a 1 every time, that would be far outside the acceptable logic of statistics. 

Also, 10 missions does not an arguement make. 

The chance of being at 83% 10 times and never getting a token is about the same as rolling a standard die 10 times and rolling 1 every time. Highly unlikely, but maybe AO is telling you to go to Vegas.....or not to go to Vegas!


FYI: The chances of rolling a 100 sided die just 10 times and rolling 1 each time is less than the chance of winning the lottery and being struck by lighting in the same SECOND. Not kidding. Something like 100 quadrillion to 1.

Correction just cos i'm bored.

Your mixed between chance and probability.

The chance of rolling a 1 on your 100 sided dice is exactly the same every time. however it is highly unprobable that you'll roll 1, 100 times.

andthensome @ 8/15/2002 11:19:37 PM (I'm really getting sick and tired of not getting missions on 3rd one 44918):
You all know how sometimes you won't get a mission after hitting accept on the 3rd mission you get?  Well, it happened to me 3 times in a row today and I'm really getting sick and tired of it.  There is NO excuse for this and it's little things like this that Funcom refuses to address that annoy the heck out of people and ultimately make them leave the game for something else.  All I have to say is Thank God for SWG.  They had their first beta and it went very smoothly.  Pull your heads out of your rear ends Unfuncom and THINK, mmkay?  It's not that hard to figure out and since you are professional programmers, you should know how to fix it.  So get back from your Norwegian summer vacation and get to work.

/me shakes head in disgust.

Oh, and also.. I STILL sometimes have health taken away from me when healing.  This was a bug from a long time ago and came back last patch.  This patch has been around for 2 months now.  VERY annoying.

THIS is the reason I'm definitely going to SWG when it comes out because you are a bunch of incompetent a$$es.

Cronosingh @ 8/16/2002 12:21:46 AM (Ghost Damage 44929):
This is some strange stuff people...It started happening yesterday evening to me and possibly others. All of the sudden, I was dead...no damage seen on my screen at all, I just fell DEAD ( and lost ALOT of xp in the process!!). This made me quite mad and I'm about to cancel my account if the ***** continues to happen. FC, you need to get on this little latency bug or whatever the hell it is because it is one of your many game breaking BUGS that will make people just up and quit and go to better games FAST. Don't belive me? Wait till Shadowbane and SW comes out, I am beting you will lose HALF OR MORE of your subscriber count because of crap like this (Oh, and not to mention the UBER UNGODLY lag in most of your zones). Before you release a freakin expansion pack I would make the original WORK RIGHT first, thank you and have a nice day.

Pluteaux @ 8/16/2002 5:06:24 AM (Changing area, please wait 44967):
Wait while the mobs in the mission use you for target practice. This has happened 3 times in the last 2 days. Twice I didn't have a lot of health left when I made it to the mission exit. But, after getting the "Changing area, please wait" message, I could hear the NPCs continue to shoot me. Instead of showing up outside the mission, I show up at the reclaim booth. The third time, I was at almost 100% health. Two mobs from the main room had attacked me, and I didn't want to fight both. I make it to the exit with 98% health, get the above message, everything freezes, and I listened to the sounds of the 2 mobs shooting me until I'm dead. When I show up at recalim, I look over the chat log and see I was shot 14 times while changing area. This had happened to me 5 or 6 times in the past, but having it happen 3 times since the last server patch makes me think something has changed to either unfix the bug fix (if it was fixed) or just make it worse.

Kabiyesi @ 8/16/2002 6:13:18 AM (44841):
It's the cave missions.  Half the time I cannot find the item and I have to wait for a GM to come fish for it.  As long as you are in the mission(and it is still active) they can find the item for you.  I've had on inside of a wall one time, and another time it was UNDER the floor.

Sometimes they are just hard to find.  Make sure you check behind all hidden walls; 90% of items are behind a hidden wall.
But as one GM told me..."if I go to a mission and it's a cave, I just turn around and run".

Hypos @ 8/16/2002 3:46:05 PM (44338):
The same thing sometimes happens with nukes.  FunCom has said that it's just a visual flaw in the health bars.  The mobs health is going down even though it doesn't look that way.  I'm guessing it's the same with the cluster attack.

Chat client is kinda wierd, first it displays all characters even
deleted ones, and if you have a long name list you must
wait 2-3 minutes with risk of it jamming (it did this a couple times on me it would just freez), and also at numeros points while im typing something and the name list refreshes(?) because some one logged on/off the thing would just crash/freez.

anythin to do to help this sucky thang?

MissQ @ 8/17/2002 12:03:23 AM (37181):
Its all nice to learn about all these different technical issues and methods for checking who is at fault not being even remotely technically minded about any of this stuff...
But.. I've been playing a long time and watched family members b4 me play right from the outset of AO.
This lag issue was a problem at the out set and then seemed to vanish for some time. It IS back, regardless of the isp, route taken to servers or graphical settings.
Weve always had AO set to maximum graphic capabilites and over the past week have dropped it to minimum to see if the previous patches have affected our performance.
We are on an always on cable which so far has had a 99.9% connection rate over the last 12 months. It is very rare it suffers from problems even in high usage hours and we do not seem to suffer these temporary lag problems with a multitude of other online games.
In about a year we have suffered no more than 10 instances of ld or disconnection from funcoms server until recently. 
This past week I have been getting bad lag constantly from anywhere between 20 seconds and 2 minute intervals.
I have been suffering LD about 5-15 times a day.
Ive regularly checked with speed tests such as those at www.dslreports.com and not once have i found any drops in performance from any test site.

The most conclusive proof to me that this is a Funcom issue is when i find myself or my pets nearly dead from ghost damage and hear multiple calls from my team crying WTF was that and Holy Cr** IM dead how'd that happen.
As far as i can tell ive been playing with people from a multitude of countries/areas and on a multitude of isp's.

How there can be a debate over whether this is an ISP issue or a problem with Funcom (or funcoms ISP) I dont know.
The problem is far too widespread throughout the game not to be related to funcom. 
And to be honest didnt most of these 'new' lag problems start around the same time they started tampering with the game to 'improve' lag in the worst affected areas?

I dont mind being flamed or proved wrong but there cant be many other factors involved for it to affect so many different players (unless you all happen to be on the same isp as me...)

If it was our isp causing all these problems and they didnt fix it, we would go elsewhere... That's a hint Funcom..

skybert @ 8/17/2002 3:55:53 AM (44997):
same thing happened in omni ent not long ago.  Maybe put in a counter, upon dying x times within y time-units, you respawn at another reclaim term, thus giving you a small chance to respawn without guards instakilling you before resshock is over.

Most of these cases are due to people not thinking properly when switching sides. So perhaps have an autoinsurance when you switch sides? When you go to omni, your autoinsurance is in entertainment. When you go to clan, your insurance is automaticly in Tir. Or something.

Just a thought.

Shyenia @ 8/17/2002 6:07:58 AM (37181):
I really do not know if it is my end or not. Being as no one has reported problems similar to mine yet and so I am asking those who frequent this thread to try a little experiment for me.

1. I seem to constantly experience a 3 second delay between my client and the FunCom servers. Such as getting the notice that my treatment skill has refreshed, yet when I click my hotkey to administer a Medical Kit I get a message saying I must wait for 2-3 seconds more.

A. Could anyone try this out with a Med-Kit and tell me if its just my end?

2. When in a battle my special attack such as fling shot will cycle through and I will get a message stating that its ready for use. Yet when I hotkey my fling shot I get the, "Please wait for  special attack to finish."

B. Could anyone try pressing their special attacks shortly after the refresh and see if they get the same message?


On a different note the server lag issue came to a head yesterday when the whole RK-1 server farm crashed for 5-10 minutes thus prompting a server wide message that there were server instabilities. Maybe Cosmik or Cz would please post what server issues the IT team is currently aware of. I am not looking for a spot to place blame but a response as to what FunCom knows definitely is the problem down there.

Shadowstalker @ 8/17/2002 11:03:46 AM (QL of mass relocating robots 45234):

Eduard @ 8/18/2002 9:05:31 PM (Instant freeze of comp 45509):
After emergency patch of server last week my computer constantly freeze when I entering fight!

It is only me who facing this problem? I never had it before. I was able stay in client more than 10 hours without freeze and constant fight in dungeons. Now I get freeze every one hour sometime more times. 

Last freeze is constant with my engi and his pet. When I send pet to fight in entrance with four guards computer just lock up. This did happens four times and I'm stuck in dungeon in New Land city just right to prison.

Dauhuai @ 8/18/2002 10:18:53 PM (37504):
I have not noticed this problem much except that I think Dezzie is right that harder missions add a modifier.   Normally I figure I have to be 87%+ to have a good chance at a token and 90% plus to feel confident.  It does not seem that 70% yields a token 70% of the time.   However since I am fairly anal about getting my token I have not tested it out much.

The other day though I decided to blitz a much higher level mission to get the item, planned on the old run in, grab and escape or not but I go my item method.    When I got in it was one of those beautifully sized missions which are small but large enough to yield a token.  My favorites since I solo for tokens and money and team for XP.   Instead of blitzing I fought dark oranges and reds (being a doc I was pretty impressed with myself too).   Found that I was doing fine but the last room had three dark reds in it.  Due to the size of the mission and the fact that I avoided most red mobs I could my % was only 35-45% (cannot remember exactly).  Finished mission and got token. Surprised and happy.

I know this doesn't help but it is what I experienced.

frakk2k @ 8/19/2002 2:14:16 AM (Glitches List! 45543):
I saw the post below this one, about the opifex head bug, and I know this has been an old bug, I tried to petition about it to get my head changed (like a face graft), but nuuway.

Anyways, so I decided to make a small list of things I know are broken, weird:

1. IC Buff still renders as "Unknown"
2. Kelarr Sunglasses bug on opifex
3. Head moved to the right on opifex when wearing coat.
4. Eradicator Rifle renders as a pistol
5. When using FaceGraft nano with baclava on, your head and gun dissapears.
6. "Hole" in the backyard, making it possible to jump in, but not out 
7. Flowers Female Armor body is green 
8. Battle suit "removes" gun.
9. Albrechts sometimes render pads only, sometimes no pads.
10. Dodga/alvin pads are rendering weird on tank armors sometimes (or any other armor)


That is just some few I could think of now, but im gonna add more and im gonna bump it  And I hope everyone else adds more to the list

Maximilian @ 8/19/2002 8:41:37 AM (943):
Just a reminder - maybe we get a fix within one of the next patches (14.5/14.6 - hope?!)

The Lokas Web Cloak (QL1) requires INT/PSY, in contrast to the
Lokas Web Cloak (QL200), that requires PSY/STA.
This is in conflict with the Marcus Divaad Web Cloak; PSY/STA for QL1 and 200 (I think this is the right PSY/STA cloak).

Furthermore, the requirements are bugged.

Below ql100 (ql99) the INT req of the Lokas cloak is fixed to '10' (nice bug) and above the cloak needs PSY/STA (ql106). I assume this results from the different reqs on the QL1 and 200 (interesting insight in the calculation model  ).

As a consequence I cannot use Lokas cloaks above ql100 (got that ql99 yesterday), but want to use them, because they fit my char (Homo Nano Engi).

Has been reported before:
Web Cloak bug
Wrong ability requirement on Lokas Web Cloak

So long,

But I still fall down, at certain spots, and when the team fights, and half the team falls down and have to spend 1 minute or more to get up (lag+not easy to find the 'correct' spot to jump up), people die.

The only work-around I know, is to use ranged attacks, pull the mobs away from that room, and cross it when no mobs are around anyMmore.

If you got a full inventory, trade directly from your bags and the trade is cancelled, the items you were going to trade are lost. The overflow window that normally opens up when you get more items than your inventory can hold doesn't show up. Fix this so it does show up. Wouldn't be much fun if someone lost a item worth millions of credits because of this. This is easy to fix so plz fix this at once.

Mekkeruni @ 8/20/2002 9:09:52 AM (Bug when evac'ing from a mission 45822):
If you reckless grid out of a mission after picking up the mission item but before you get mission complete and mission reward, you will not get the mission reward at all. This has been tested several times and I can make it happen every time I try. What seems to happens is that you complete the mission while you're about to zone into the grid. At the same time you're supposed to get the mission reward but you don't get it since you're "unavailable" while you're gridding or something like that.

So allways wait in the mission untill the mission reward is in your inventory even though you got all the mobs in the mission after blitzing through it. Even if there is 5 gigantic enforcers after you ready to beat the crap out of you, even if you're doing a ql 250 mission with mobs capable of killing you in 2 hits ;/

PS. The item you pick up to complete the mission will disappear when you delete the mission so don't sell that primus coat you picked up if you don't want an angry buyer after you.

QL55 Battlesuit Bugs: (no, it isn't lag, I keep a green ping 90% of the time, and never FPS lag)

I quad when wearing it. (duelwielding, its an okay bug, keep it)

Mobs do not die sometimes after taking several times their hitpoints in damage, so they get free hits in untill I hit "X" and sit, then they "die", and become lootable. 

Also if I wait 3 minutes or so (on a battle that should last max. 10seconds) it will refresh and they "die".

No weapons graphic. =( I miss my Sleekbasters.

During combat I melee, instead of shoot energy beams o' death out of my fists...why? 

It usually doesn't even melee when I'm killing something, just sort of jitters through two or three frames of animation.

No rings, or symbios are equipable while wearing it.

The "no other armor while special armor is being worn" thing is logical, but rings and grafts?!


Other:

Uhm, I don't know how/why, but sometimes general junk will reappear after I've sold it. I just destroy it since it isn't worth the effort to walk to a store again. Usually happens after I ding it seems.

Weapon slot items give the "This item requires a computer deck..." message if trying to equip from a bag, it needs to be placed in inventory then rclicked, sometimes it will equip, sometimes not untill you zone.

Zepto @ 8/20/2002 2:33:47 PM (Team Mission Bug 45877):
A small bug last night in a team mission.  We were plowing right through the mission until a freak accident cause the NT to die.  (yep, it was me)  As I spent time at the reclaim the rest of the team finished out the level.  I kept in contact with them and as I zoned back into the mission I imeadeatly head "WTF happened?  Our percentage to kill was at 79% and now it went down to 62%?"  All I can figure is that the lost percentage is that 17% that I was out of the mission for.  It seems that the team missions report a complete percentage twoards token based on the least percentage person in the team.  This is bad is someone goes LD or joins at the last min as you can not get to 100%.  There were jokes about how we were performing the mission badly and that is why we were having percentage taken away.

Demios @ 8/20/2002 2:50:40 PM (40543):

He starts out with a powerful root and runs just out of view then quickly pops right back into view knowing full well what it does to my guns. At fist I thought he just does it by mistake, and that he was just trying to get out of range of my guns, but when I break root and run up to him he doesn’t bother to root me or try to get out of range again because he knows my guns have become useless until I zone again.

Maximilian @ 8/21/2002 9:11:45 AM (Warped to the boss 46111):
Haven't found another post on this topic, so I thought I post it.

It has happened twice to me, that while fighting the boss I get regularly warped to him/her!

Both times, this happened, I soloed gray cave team missions (2 person catch), one in Clon****, the other in 4 Holes. All went fine until the boss room.

During the first incident I got even stuck in the !ceiling! of the boss room without any chance to escape - luckily I dropped down after a few minutes (with the boss) so I could escape.

The second time I even got warped from the floor below/above the boss room back to her feet!!!

Both times the following scheme:
I went up and finished the bystander (one or two approaches) and started to concentrate on the boss (Engi with pet here). After one or two minutes of fight I suddenly get warped directly to the location of the boss. This does not change the combat behaviour (if I am attacked or not), but I prefer to stand close to the lift, for reasons that might be obvious. It looks a little bit like a timer/counter that is increasing, and after a certain time, some 'warp' command is initiated. Extremly annyoing when you zoned down/up at low HP to heal yourself up and still have the attack on you and get warped back to the boss room ... .

Only happened when I am alone, so far.

Somebody else?

So long,

Max(imilian)

OneManArmy @ 8/21/2002 9:31:19 AM (46111):
Some bosses are supposed to warp you.
And it does not surprice me that FC managed to screw it up.  Getting warped to the ceiling.... bah!

btw, I've never met any warping bosses. (lucky me, I guess)

Kzak @ 8/21/2002 9:32:43 AM (46111):
This has happened to me and several others I know of.

Not a bug, I think. Some bosses have the 'power' to teleport you to them. And yes, it -is- annoying if you've just escaped the boss room to sit down and heal up, but there's not a whole lot to be done about it rather than try escaping the boss room again, if you're teleported to the boss.

Kzak @ 8/21/2002 9:37:13 AM (45821):
You can force the overflow window to open, however, by having a full inventory and using a tradeskill process (say, using a bio-comm on a monster part). Hopefully the items will be found there.

Maximilian @ 8/21/2002 9:56:31 AM (46111):
Thanks for the info, guys. Soso,

it's not a bug, it's a feature - where did I hear that before ... ? 

Must have missed that one - wait, some bosses now know new tricks ... (ahhh, I remember something like that). While I have to say, it ****es the thing up, it has happened to me only with Bosses, that use ranged weapons ... - would make sense on melee bosses if they are surrounded by gun wielding characters.

-> Kzak: Right, I managed to escape a second time, thanks to my pet and the attack delay timer after zoning, but I will have an closer eye on my health bar, just in case I have to escape a second time.

So long,

Max(imilian)

P.S. Where did you get that hair cut, looks not bad on you

baffle @ 8/21/2002 10:17:51 AM (46111):
I've been warped to the boss several times, but never from another floor. If you get warped you will exit combat mode. Must be a hell to get warped while soloing a boss, so I understand the frustration.

hmm... 4Holes and Clon**** .. Are you framing tokens? :-)

Maximilian @ 8/21/2002 11:34:44 AM (46111):
-> EvilBaffle

... Must be a hell to get warped while soloing a boss, so I understand the frustration.

Actually I couldn't see the sense behind such an action, therefore I wondered, and yes, my Adrenalin alway jumps skyhigh, when I get warped to the Boss with low HP.

But to be honest, sometimes it is really benefical to have a stupid pet with you (don't tell the other professions, I said Engi has a good side  ).
If you manage to drag your rust can all the way to the boss room and if the boss is not to high in level (yellow/orange) and your pet is high enough and your Aggro trimmer is of appropriate level (a lot of ands, I know), then it is rather feasable to get the boss.
You just enter the room, put the pet on the Boss (draw aggro) and after a few hits attack the bystander with the pet and by yourself. Just switch the pet between Boss and assistant as you need for aggro and zone when you can't heal up the pet any more. With this tactic I can solo team missions (2) up to my own level usually. Sometimes even 1.1 missions (sometimes).

These trash can takes a lot, ya know.  Just keep yourself out of the line of fire.


What do you mean with farming tokens?

/me turns around and starts counting tokens: 1, 2, 3, ... 390, 391, 392. 

Not really farming, but at level 100 I am allowed to upgrade to 400 token board and I need that final 700 HP asap (asides from 200 NP and CL) - Homo Nano Engi here.

Enough off topic stuff for now,

Peisinoe @ 8/21/2002 12:55:51 PM (Pvp lag/ranged weapon issue 46167):
Not really a bug, more of a lag issue. 

But during massive fights, somtimes when you die, there'll be so much lag that you'll continue to be hitting/attacking people after you died. Now this can be kind of a hassel if you're a ranged weapon user. The game on one hand thinks you're dead. So your inventory is empty. On the other hand due to lag, it thinks you're fighting. So your gun keeps going off and soon runs out of ammo. Well, then your gun unequips itself and if you're the type who needs it buffed/wrangled whathaveyou on, then it's kind of a pain to jump back into things. :P

Now I assume there's a good reason for having your guns unequip when running out of ammo. I admit that I'm kind of at a loss as to what they might be at the moment, but I'm sure there must be. :P 

I have visuals so low from paranoia that this will happen to me again when I'm in 2ho or that pathetic hq fight.

Ocura @ 8/21/2002 1:14:44 PM (44841):
I 've had mission items missing before aswell, I agree with you, if a GM can verify that OOPSIE item did not spawn -  he/she should also be able to say: Here you go, you sure earned it =)

Ever had your mission item spawn ontop of a pile of boxes in a dark corner of a dungeon ? lol If a friend wouldn't have told me to check these, I would have walked out with empty hands... again.

You have been hit by nanos for 2544 points of unknown damage.

even though i dont pvp this is worth a bump.

please expose similiar game breaking bugs to the public maybe that will change something

Necron99 @ 8/21/2002 2:44:23 PM (Most bizarre episode ever 46202):
A Guildie got a tell from a GM to bring "heavy hitters" to throw at the Omni-HQ defenders. Ok, I buff up and click the Athen West grid term. The grid has been pretty weird for me lately, so somethimes it takes more than one try - I click twice before "changing area"....

When I zone in, much to my bafflement I am NOT in the grid - I find myself in the entry room of a low-level medical office mission! Seconds later, a L150-ish soldier type zones in beside me. After the initial WTF kinda things I find out that he too was trying to use the term in WA.  I check my stuff and find I have no old missions or keys - Nothing strange at all except for the fact that I am not in the grid but a mission I never had.

So the soldier and I zone out...into Borealis. After leaving, I could not re-enter the mission area.

Normally nothing about AO surprises me any more, but this was odd enough that I thought a report may be in order.

Ichnou @ 8/22/2002 9:45:49 AM (Can't see some people 46402):
Yesterday evening, we were having our weekly meeting in our guild, but a strange bug had occured. Some people, like me, were unable to see some guys although they were in the same room. We were able to chat, to private chat, but not to see them.
If you want, I have a screenshot
Look here for the screen 
Slayer6900 was supposed to be in front of me, but the chair seems to be empty, and Ambrevive had the same problem

Hypos @ 8/22/2002 6:05:47 PM (46402):
Well, assuming they weren't sneaking at the time, there is a well known bug where some players simply can't see some other players.  Frustratingly, this happens in team missions a lot.  The work around is to have either the player with the vision problem or the invisible player either zone run outside of detection range and then come back.  This usually fixes the problem.

It's very dangerous, though, to be in combat when the healer can't see you.  Team heals still work in that situation, but not the direct heals.

Ichnou @ 8/22/2002 6:14:00 PM (46402):
Yes, we are sure no one was sneaking.
But we try to zone (we were in the castle of Avalon and we leave the castle and re-enter it) but it doesn't work.

Soroun @ 8/22/2002 7:50:18 PM (46111):
I've been warped back UP to the boss room, right after escaping and sitting down to heal. Rather frustrating, but it only happened once. This is one "feature" that they could have left out.

I've also encountered a similar situation in a single player (non-boss) mission. I was running for the exit because I had bitten off more than I could chew and when I was within a few feet of the exit door, I was suddenly warped back to the spot I had originally started to flee from ... several rooms back.

Ayone else experienced this? Is this a known "bug" or is it a "feature?"

Soroun

Magnificus @ 8/22/2002 9:12:49 PM (Found a Exploit...what to do... 46528):
I have found an exploit, a major one and wish to talk to someone about it.... Where do I do this? I talked to a GM in game and he told me an email but I forgot it due to playing for a few hours afterwards.


And since this bug is a rather large and FC would really benefit from this, I want to know if they offer a reward system?  I am all for the health of the game but I mean don't you think that a tiny reward would be too much to ask? I would only ask for a yalm =p

Krneki @ 8/22/2002 10:44:31 PM (46528):
If you have any information about an exploit, send an e-mail to exploits@anarchy-online.com.

Vydas @ 8/22/2002 11:07:45 PM (46111):
I have had that, yes, but it's always seemed to me to be lag related.

Veev @ 8/23/2002 3:51:55 AM (46528):
They won't give you a reward.  I use to inform them of over two exploits a day almost.. probably reported over 50 serious exploits, 90% of the time I was the first/only person to report them.  All I asked for was a simple first name change (not player nickname, and this was before they decided to start granting name changes) and they said no..  go Funcom.

Hypos @ 8/23/2002 6:52:58 PM (46402):
Here's another possibility.  Some playfields are designed to hold a certain number of people.  If too many people try to enter such a playfield, the enter another identical playfield instead.  I've experienced this in the cyborg dungeon.  In other threads, I've seen reports that there are actually 3 different castles.  This was used by some people to go after the dragon multiple times in a single spawn.

If that's the problem, one way around it is to have an engie warp players to his location.  That seems to always bring them to the version of the playfield that he is in.

Taxadion @ 8/24/2002 2:39:13 AM (44338):
I've also noticed this BUT also noticed these same mobs keeling over dead with apparently 1/4 health left... Looks like a visual bug to me.

hashy @ 8/24/2002 3:30:36 PM (45543):
you take unknown damage when a stamina buff expires. you lose the pts in sta, which causes you to lose pts in body dev, which causes you to lose a few hp.

frakk2k @ 8/25/2002 1:49:44 AM (45543):
Really? I have never noticed. Could be a annoying bug I bet. 


There is also that irritating, "where did my items go" inside shops. It has still not been fixed.

Destractor @ 8/25/2002 4:52:10 PM (When I zone I don't want to die 47094):
Why is it that half the time, when I zone I hit hit by mobs.
I just got hit for 1600 damage (about 7 hits) while I was zoning out of the mission. Needless to say I died (the reason I zoned was my lack of health)

When telling them about an exploit they'll say something like "oh, gee. thanks" IF they bother to answer you at all.

And then, two weekslater, you find the exploit still functioning.

Go figure.

OneManArmy @ 8/26/2002 3:28:01 PM (47094):
Lag, latency problems.  Your client think it's on it's way out, while the server keeps you in the field a few seconds more.
Excacttly the same problem as we have with special attack, first aid kits, treatment labs etc...

The client timer fail to follow the server timer, and thus I cannot use Dimach when my screen say "Dimach (Soul Attack) available", use fling shot, first aid kits, when the client think I should be able to.
That's why you get hit 7 times after you zone.
That's why I can survive having 0HP.
That's why a mob hits me after I killed it.
That's why a mob with 0HP still stands up.

If there was some sort of syncing between server and client, it might cause more lag, but this would be fixed.

Yep, and when they finally get around to fixing it and doing a search for who used it, they will ban you with the rest of the people who "used" it reguardless if you reported it or not.

Reprimand @ 8/26/2002 5:07:05 PM (12:00 GMT server lags for several minutes. 47334):
This has been noticed by a lot of folks in RK2, don't know if it's also happening on RK1.

Every day RK2 shudders at exactly 7:00pm my time (Central time USA).  This is coincidentally exactly 12:00 (midnight) GMT/UTC time.  For approximately 3-5 minutes the game server will lag tremendously often causing a few to disconnect.  The chat server, however, is fine.  My guild, group and other channels continue to chat freely without lag, usually discussing what we've named the "Witching Hour".  The problem is severe enough that I've taken to watching the time and trying to be somewhere safe when this happens instead of fighting mobs in a mission...

Abunari @ 8/26/2002 5:22:10 PM (47334):

The Tir Server seems to be getting worse and worse and worse with each comming day.   It's getting to the point to where it is virtually unplayable.  Is this issue being looked at and remedied or is this going to be lost in the long line of, "Stuff to fix but we don't know how?"

Aqua @ 8/26/2002 9:22:30 PM (guns in trade 47387):
Has anybody noticed there are guns on the wall behind the grid point in trade that actually move and everything but they don't seem to fire on clanners as they come through the grid. 

Is this a bug or something FC turned off......


~aqua

Bionitrous @ 8/26/2002 9:28:22 PM (47387):
I'm pretty sure, those are just client-side graphics like the bugs and rabbits that scamper around town.  If you can't click on it and get a POD (----o--|------) then it's not 'real'.

Yeah, I saw a 'newstand' near the grid entrance between the Whom'pas in Ent.  I clicked on it and nothing happened.  Is this a bug as well.

Aqua @ 8/26/2002 11:23:39 PM (47387):
well thats too bad  . 

Now that you mentioned the Pod thing thou that kinda means that a GM might be able to spawn a gun in the middle of some place, huh.
~Aqua

Bionitrous @ 8/27/2002 8:23:02 AM (47387):
Yes, a GM could probably spawn a Liberator or whatever them cannons are called.  They are actually MOB's like them spitting plants.  They just can' t move.

mineboss @ 8/27/2002 9:23:29 AM (Bot bug? 47499):
I think i have found a bug if I make my Perfected Guardbot (ql 119) he need 561 in TS and MC and I have 451 (unbuffed) I do that with mochams and then kill them.

Then I do follow and the bot say it’s an illegal command, but when I buff me with general it’s work fine.

If you take 20% from 561 it’s be 448.8 so my 451 it’s inside the 20% off. 

Anyone else have that problem?

Gattolina @ 8/27/2002 11:45:52 AM (Bug? Can't use nano rechargers / treat. kits after zoning from boss room 47521):
Not sure if this is a bug or not, but it's quite annoying. 
Scenario 1:
I am in a team in a mission. We jump down to kick boss around. My hp drops, so I jump up. I try to heal. I get "Can't use item. Target is in fight". I have to jump down, pray that the boss will still shoot on my team mate so I can sit down and heal in boss room. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't....

Scenario 2:
Team mission, boss room. I jump up. I heal. Team mate jumps up. I don't get to heal any more. "Target can't be in fight". Team mate heals and recharges nanos. After he leaves, I still can't heal or recharge. Need to go down again, to heal in boss room. (Luckily I team most with an adventurer, who will heal me before going back to fighting.)

Scenario 3:
Team mission, boss room. I jump up after team mate. I can't heal. Same as before.

Scenario 4:
Team mission, boss room. I jump up after team mate. Now I can heal!

I still haven't managed to trace the differences in what allows me to heal and what doesn't. I hit Q just before jumping up (to stop fighting) and it's a 50-50 chance I will get to heal. Same as if I don't hit Q before jumping.

Is there anything to do about this? Any tricks??? Anything to remember? I am a trader, level 40. Doesn't seem to be a connection between ransacks / deprives and the disabled healing. I can be chain healing my team mate, only shooting at the mob (no offensive nanos that I can remember), and STILL get the error message when I have to heal. 

Any advise will be very usefull!

Kirikiri

Cz @ 8/27/2002 12:20:56 PM (47521):
It's all about who's the target of the MOBs' hate. If anybody has you on top of the list, due to you collecting a lot of 'hate' from the MOB (damage, healing, nano use, etc), or your friends not doing so (using a de-aggro tool, dying, running off), you will be under attack, even though the creature can't reach you.

Basically, you need to get somebody to get the MOBs (all the MOBs) to forget about you. Then you'll be able to recharge.

Darkbane @ 8/27/2002 12:38:22 PM (47521):
Using a 'porter in a team mission is not zoning (just as using the ferry from Trade to Harry's isn't) and whislt you can't be hit, you do retain aggro and so can't use med-kits and nano-rechargers.

It is therefore about managing aggro. With a team, people tend to jump out to heal whilst there are still other team members in the boss room, this is usually enough to shift aggro after a moment or two allowing you to heal/recharge and head back on in.

If everyone ends up out of the room and in need of healing, then chances are at least one will be able to. They then heal, jump back in, draw aggro and port back out after the 10 seconds. This enables everyone else to heal.

This behaviour is probably quite deliberate - wouldn't want things to be too easy after all...

Aqua @ 8/27/2002 12:58:07 PM (47387):
I was playing on test last night and I noticed that the trade grid has two guards by it, sombody said the ENT grid was the same way. plus in both places the guards were doubled, so I guess now those guns working or not working isn't important  

~aqua

Scorus @ 8/27/2002 2:37:16 PM (47521):
On the plus side, the only reason that you can go down from the boss room is because the aggro carries over. When team missions first hit test, you couldn't use the arrows if you were in combat. But that resulted in some people getting trapped on the level below the boss level (they would go down and then their pet or teammate would get killed and the boss would aggro them) and so they made it so that you could escape with the arrows.

Think how much fun those rooms would be if you were stuck in them...

Scorus

Darkbane @ 8/27/2002 2:54:27 PM (47521):
Yeah, I remember that  And when team missions first hit testlive, things didn't need line-of-sight to aggro on you... It made that first room rather hectic!

Don't have that one, but have you checked the reqs on the shell after you created it?. Some of them are higher than what it takes to cast, and a couple points in your case would make the difference.
There is even a slayerdroid (sentinel I think) that is a complete waste of a nano, since the shell it creates takes exactly the same skill to use as the next higher level pet. This was glossed over in the Official Answers from FC thingy as "intended".

It is possible that the pet is bugged tho, I've heard of some crat pets with the same problem.

Zepher @ 8/27/2002 5:49:31 PM (!!! Attackrating bug on Ma's???!!! 47580):
I just noticed that I don't get the attack rating buff from a crat running motivational buffs => +100 attack and +310 Def ...

Also the bonus on the 1k token board of +7 isn't there when I look at my attackrating ...

for example a Trader has a shotgun and has that base attack rating of 1143 selfbuffed (drains n stuff) ... then gets + 100 to attackrating when crat runs motivational nano...

why don't the ma's get that added?

I know my Ma skill is my attackrating but so is shotgun for a trader (example) ... but they do get the + attack and we dont...

Could this be looked into and fixed plz... This is not just some random bug.

Bodysnatch.

Mercatura @ 8/27/2002 6:22:55 PM (47580):
Yeah its a real old bug too. Not sure if its intended or not. 

Something to do with fist QL being related to actual MA skill? So even though you have an ams boost, the game still thinks you have X QL fists (?)

Ma weapons do get the boost I think.

AOThirdup @ 8/27/2002 8:44:18 PM (47499):
I've seen this a few times as well (I don't recall which level bots it occured though) but I often get tells from other engineers asking about exactly what you discribe.  I suspect some of the shells are mislabled.  Someone else suggested it may be some sort of rounding error.  

I always keep a few pieces of Dillon, etc in my equipment pack.  Whenever this came up I would just toss them on for a level to up my intel a few points and it put me back in control.

Hey, you're an engineer.  We're supposed to fix broken stuff, right?

Yes there are roughly 5 shells that are bugged (that I know of personally.) Along with all other engi related things wont be heard wont be fixed, good luck. I can tell you with certainty that this is one of the shells that is bugged. In fact I would even go as far to say that same issue is why so many of the bots in that line have higher reqs on the shell then on the nano....dare I say cover up of l33t code borking.

Tentumbs @ 8/28/2002 5:25:23 PM (47499):
I have the same on a LOT of mine. It is always a trill when you have cast a new pet to see if it will do as you say as soon as the Mocham wher off.

Tentumbs @ 8/28/2002 6:35:50 PM (Bug using buff on pets 47854):
If you have a buff active on a pet and try to recast it on it before the oldone is finish then often the old timer hangs on and it stops after the first buff should be finished and not the newly cast.

i.e. If I cast enegy coocon on my pet (Lasts 25 minutes) and then after 20 minutes cast it again. It sometimes still ends 5 minutes after that, not the newly refreshed 25 minutes.

To execute RT you must of course have 630 in SI/PM.

Hypos @ 8/30/2002 4:44:55 PM (47983):
It's probably not an exploit.  Sometimes, FunCom adds the Unique tag to an item after it's already been in the game for a while.  So, you could have legally gotten the two items in the bank back then.  Of course, if you take one out now, you won't be able to put it back while the other's still there.

For instance, there are some people walking around wearing 2 IQ rings.  It was legal when they put them on, so it's not an exploit.

Pepin @ 8/30/2002 4:55:51 PM (47983):
As far as I know, you can put as many 'Unique' items as you want in the Bank.

It's getting many of these same items out of the Bank that's hard .

For example, I had a lot of those "Cloaking Devices" ( http://auno.org/ao/db.php?cmd=view&id=84160&t=ag ) in my Bank, and it was a pain to get them out to sell them... (O Trade helped).

It is not intended that you are able to own more than one Unique of the same type. This is a bug in the current code that will be fixed. It is not decided yet what will happen if you have several such items when the fix comes, but we will give proper notice of this before the change happens.

We will not ban people for owning two of the same Unique item. I would suggest you do not wear / wield two of the same Unique item though.

I will make an announcement here on the bulletin board on this right now, as it has caused some unrest among players in the game.

gnuman @ 8/30/2002 8:28:13 PM (47983):
How about cloaking devices I've had in my bank like forever and suddenly made unique?

How about reflect bracers that are made unique in 14.5?

How about armor that are loosing its unique tag in 14.5?

Im sure the list goes on...

Maybe you should fix your code first and then blame people later? Your whole unique-code is bugged beyond reason and has always been. Banning people left and right because of that is simply stupid.

Cz @ 8/30/2002 8:39:25 PM (47983):
Removed a couple of posts. If you want to discuss specific cases, feel free to send me an e-mail. The bulletin board is not the channel for account discussions.

Note, however, that I do not discuss details of cases with anybody but the owner of the account in question. Legal matters. I'm sure you can understand that.

Noer, I'm pretty sure the list stops there, or at max have a couple of more points. You make it sound like it's never-ending.

I will look into those issues on Monday. Not before. In the meantime, please let me have an easy weekend, by keeping this issue off the bulletin board. It is not the proper channel for it, and I will do what I can to provide you all with info on this, on Monday.

Thank you.

Have a nice and calm weekend, everybody.

No, I'm gonna delete posts, and ban people, calling me a liar when I tell the truth.

If you have a problem with that, please say so.

So we are to interpretate that as you are not going to ban people due to this in the future?

Cz @ 8/30/2002 8:52:47 PM (47983):
Noer, that is a very correct interpretation.

However, I might add to that interpretation that I in no way stated that previous cases on this issue will remain as is today.

That is vague enough for me to post it. I hope it's clear enough for you - as a guild leader and friend - to understand it.

{Edited for bad English.}

gnuman @ 8/30/2002 8:54:39 PM (47983):
That was the answer I was looking for.

keen @ 8/30/2002 10:42:53 PM (Sceen distorted!! Can someone plz help!! 48378):
It suddenly happened yesterday, when all my settings were wiped out and i had to redo my settings again (setting video cards, resolution and such) After i reseted everything and got back on, the screen was distorted (i am not running in window mode), everything in game seem to be flattened somwhat, i'd say by 10% or so. all the characters, buildings, and machines all seem to fatter and shorter (actually look kinda like it was running in window mode), one can clearly tell all the images are distorted!! i tried to change all the settings including picking all video cards and resolutions, nottin seem to be working at all!!! So if someone know how o resolve this, plz let me know!! cuz this is getting very annoying!! thanx alot.

Reprimand @ 8/31/2002 2:02:50 AM (47334):
BUMP.

This just happened to me and I was disconnected fighting a boss mob in a mission!  8PM my time precisely.  This one is really getting old!

Catalyste @ 8/31/2002 2:08:13 AM (47983):
Well I wondered about this when I took off an IQ ring to use a signet for a buff, and then could not put the IQ ring back on.  I am sure I have a few of the same items (albeit different quality levels) in my bank.  Cloaks for instance, as I have gradually upgraded and stuck the old on in the bank till someone needs it.

Cz, et. al.:  I have no one to blame for my own ignorance here if this has ALWAYS been a rule, and was posted, and I will still accept SOME responsility if there was no check in the game itself to prevent it (I doubt this).  I know I have more than one Cloak in my bank, and prolly 2 on me since I just upgraded again.  I do the same with damage bracers, I mean I cannot trade or self the old ones anyway.  I also don't mind that much if it was just recently made a rule IF:  

1) You give those of us who hardly ever read patchnotes and forums a chance to be either  "Grandfathered in" or 

2)give us a while to get our stuff out of there, please .  Thank you. I need me a link where I needed to be reading...sigh

Funcom has discovered that the Anarchy Online client has serious crashes with the Windows XP service pack 1. We are currently getting assistance from Microsoft to fix this problem and it has our highest priority right now.

Looks like Microsoft are trying to hijack Anarchy Online 

"getting assistance from Microsoft to fix this problem"

Well... What can I say but: GOOD LUCK!! 

As if Microsoft would care?
I mean did they ever care?

Tip of the Day: Remove Win XP and install Dos 6.2 and Win 3.1, that should work about the same...

Well as Cz said, adequate notice will be given, so when is this "notice" coming? *grins*

Mandor @ 8/31/2002 3:32:34 PM (47983):
I know people that have been banned for this reason without getting any "adequat notice".

Want names ?

Romer @ 9/1/2002 10:18:38 PM (37181):
im a caster and i am not experiencing what you have described here Beaker.

Maybe once in a mission there is a lag pocket but thats it.

Every 2 minutes is a severe exageration.

edit: Switched ontopic/offtopic paragraphs around .


ON THE TOPIC:

Oh, and I gotta check about 50 bags of stuff now... I can never remember which items are NODROP, which UNIQUE, and which are both... nor what/how many I have in the bank in the first place. I'm sure I'm no the only absent-minded player who keeps all the junk s/he ever finds ...

btw, now don't get me wrong, I'm speaking as a fellow pragmatical programmer - make sure you keep thorough logs before the patch that handles the UNIQUEs. Historically speaking, chances are that all heck will break out and the ARK's are gonna be pretty busy... it's not impossible to imagine a few glitches as well, as players have traditionally been, um, "innovative" in using/placing items in ways that designers haven't thought of .
I'm just getting a tingly danger-sense thinking of spiders or crawls that will go over the database and start deleting items based on some sophisticated heuristic .

yo... /me raises hand 

um, I'm sure you meant it in a different way then what I interpret it as...

you're the community guy... that makes your job harder and puts you in a more of a spot then any other single poster on the boards, for sure... but it is your job, eh? And I know you get training (some of which you'd probably rather skip) on how to handle "problematic cases" (pretty much all of us at one point or another). 

My idea of a community / customer service representative is a guy who reasons, diplomatically, and disproves people that are mistaken... not bans them.

You'll be called liar a lot - and I'm sure you have been in the past - I know I have when I've performed semi-similar duties... some people are malicious, some obnoxious, some simply don't have the facts or are mistaken, some need to cool down because they feel they've been injured... and I'm sure at SOME point in your career somebody will  call you a liar and be right - nobody is 100% perfect.

Delete a post for profanity of course; move it if it's in the wrong place... but somehow banning a person because you feel they insult your personal honour seems unprofessional. If they're wrong, show how they're wrong and the judgement of their peers will hopefully make them reasonable again.

and also remember, as you often point out, you yourself don't always have all the facts .

ThePartisan @ 9/2/2002 7:30:40 AM (48498):
Anyway... hope they fix it. I have been experiencing some REALLY serious crashes, and I can only assume this is the reason, as the crashes mostly have occured while playing AO. Only solution has been to reinstall Windows, of course leading to further problems...  Before this news message I actually suspected a faulty hard drive, but I guess that\s not the case.    And that \ instead of the proper character is because I just reinstalled&repaired, and the keymap seems to have changed

Finfarin @ 9/2/2002 8:17:02 AM (37504):
Just last night I also experienced this. 4 Missions in a row ended at between 97-99% and , no token. 

   Most teams Im on dont go less than 100%, but if the last remaining mob is 4 floors below in some corner someone missed then usually people dont want to go back for it.

 Ive lost track of how many times ive not gotten a token if the mission ends between 97%-99% Ive probably run a good 100 missions in the past weeks...odds would say that worst case about 3 of them i wouldnt have gotten a token, but 4 in one sitting? something is definately wrong with that! It alost seems that if its less 100% I have less than a 50% to get a token reward.

Finfarin @ 9/2/2002 8:19:55 AM (47788):

I'll give you a bump on this one , its a very annoying graphical glitch that one alvin pad sticks way out the front if your an opifex.

Kzak @ 9/2/2002 8:30:46 AM (Dillon armor 48836):
It appear that Dillon armor (not Nova Dillon) only drops as boots. I've never seen any other armor-parts like helmet, sleeves, pants etc. drop from bosses.

I want this armor due to the Int boost, which is good for tradeskills and nanoskills.

A bug with the drop-tables?

EDIT:

Others have seen Dillon as gloves, one have seen a Dillon body-armor. Perhaps it's merely very rare instead of existing as only boots.

ThePartisan @ 9/2/2002 8:51:00 AM (37504):

RedSonja @ 9/2/2002 11:25:58 AM (48498):
This is not Microsoft's problem so why the hell should they care?
I reported this issue directly to MS after I got my first build of WinXP SP1.
There response was to check again with the next build.
Next build had exactly the same problem, so next report from MS told me "Errors confirmed, Funcom need to fix" and my issue was cloased.
I actually e-mailed Funcom no less than two months ago explaining that I was beta testing WinXP SP1 and that currently AO was not compatible.

The response I had from Funcom was "We do not support beta versions of software".

This is Funcom's issue, it is not Microsoft's responsability and it is an issue that Funcom have known about for at least two months.
Try placing the blame at the feet of those at fault, don't be a sheep and attempt to put the blame with MS, it is not their fault.

Snuble @ 9/2/2002 1:57:51 PM (47983):
I'm getting worried here... Recently started to look at the sneaky ways of the game  So I buy a cloaking device. Hmm...  it requires concealment???  Okay, run to another shop, buy a low quality level one, and w00t it work 

Now of course its not even close to pushing my concealment borders, so I shop yet another one... And looks at the description, an realizes that oooops, there is now 3 unique items in my inventory... On the word of someone more wise then me, I delete the two I didn't want asap

Paffy @ 9/2/2002 2:28:34 PM (47983):
So it was ok to ban one without giving proper warning and then change the ruling?

You had one second of clarity and realized that by enforcing the rule of which you banned one would mean that you would need to ban half your player base and decided to change the ruling.

How about unbanning the poor person who got to be the test subject before you came to your senses?

Happily there is a choice for those who dont mind playing fantasy (and who cares anyways since thats where AO is/is heading) and its name is Acheron's Call 2.

Has better graphics than AO, better code than AO and already has more content in beta than AO after one year. They also have one successfull MMORPG under their belt and know what they are doing and improving upon old.

No, you wont see me in SWG or Neocron (dont like em) but you _WILL_ see me in AC2, most likely allied to Dominion.

Zarch and da chars

You want content and quests? Go see AC2

gnuman @ 9/2/2002 3:07:28 PM (47983):
So this is the Customer "We don't Care". You ban a person, change the policy and refuse to fix the wrong doings with lame excuses.

You are ready to ban half of AO because of YOUR bugs in AO. Well, good luck Funcom - it is your own grave you are digging.

Remember players are paying for your service. Not for you to use your powertrip. You know the strongest personalities are the ones who realise that they did wrong and tries to fix it. The ones coming up with new and even lamer excuses to cover up the whole thing are a sad sad person.

Good luck Funcom. You still got a lot to learn a lot about how to treat your customers. Screw one innocent person and all the friends of the person is going with him/her.

assassimon @ 9/2/2002 3:28:34 PM (47983):
I have 3 Senior Omni Intern-Op Coats I got them as boss loot at diffrent times, put them in bags with all other junk and put the bags in bank.

I checked all bags afew days ago and saw that I had 3 coats...

I have only put them in bank without doing anything special, exactly same as the person you banned did.

He put unique items in bank, not in any special way, just put them in bank..

Almost every AO player have 2 of same unique item in bank.

Have you checked your own bank Cz (if you even play the game, doubt many at FC play) you have 2 coats, 2 iq rings, 2 of any unique item there?

I think all people that play see how stupid this is of FC to ban a person, change the policy right away after and say they won't ban people for it and then not lift the ban...

Perma ban a person for having 2 unique items in bank won't exactly give you more customers.

assassimon @ 9/2/2002 3:34:00 PM (48498):
I use Win XP and SP1 (I think, or is SP2 out?) and I don't crash more than normally....so it's not all that crash atleast...

gnuman @ 9/2/2002 3:59:43 PM (47983):
and let me quote from IRC:


	
		
			
			
				[13:39] <Noer> so now that you wont unban Demios. Are you making it equal for all and ban everyone on same conditions?
[13:39] <Cz|busy> I believe so.
[13:39] <Cz|busy> It's of course a matter of severity.
			
		
	

So everyone who are hurt by Funcom's crappy unique code or a servercrash so an item got duped will be banned - unless they go bankrupt.
Well, GG Funcom - I hope you realise what you are about to do.

Shadelore @ 9/2/2002 4:30:28 PM (47983):
So this means I have to about make a DB over the content in my numerous bags in bank, where I am sure there is severeal double uniques I havent noticed due to items getting/ungetting unique etc last year, so I can keep close track over what I got, otherwise I will be banned...Along with everybody else who have played a while...

What do u suggest we do, sift our banks and delete everything that there is 2 of?

That would be fair enough, but how about you give some notice about things like this before you starting banning my friends, which is the main reason I play..?

I, as a paying adult customer would appreciate to be see some mature way to approach these matters. It is not fun when you wonder is your account will be banned next time you log on for having 2 cloaking devices(are they unique now) or something.

I admit this sounds a bit crass, but  I feel the need to be a tad crass by seeing things like this happen, so please forgive me, nothing personal.

Shadelore @ 9/2/2002 4:36:24 PM (47983):
I think its seriously about time to leave soon, and leave this to ppl who havent had all the bad experiences thrown at them...

Benr @ 9/2/2002 5:38:52 PM (48498):
Just to let u know microsoft does care to a degree, that degree is that they tell what they changed, Microsoft DOES NOT HELP them find and fix just tells them what they changed =/
that is just infomation i know from friends that makes games.

Dauhuai @ 9/2/2002 8:15:25 PM (37504):
I have been trying to keep track closer, of course most teams shoot for 100%.

So far 

98% token
89% token
60% (solo) no token
48% (solo) token, go figure
87% token

Maybe FC just likes me cause I'm a handsome Atrox Doc.

Zeronx @ 9/2/2002 10:49:56 PM (47983):
I must agree.....I am not sure how you ment your "Banning people for calling you a liar" statement.  In my honest opinion from being in the real world myself.....that is BS !  Banning someone because you don't like what they have to say ?  That is a little abusive of power and I know that several who have read it already are wondering what else do they have to tread on egg shells for so as to not offend you Cz ?  YOU are in this position to listen to the customers, and to be constructive in the dealings with them.  If you cannot handle that ( and yes I know you have to put up with alot of crap) then it is probably time for you to pass this off to someone else that is not as burned out.

You are in a business !  If you cannot supply adequate information and response to the questions and needs of your customers then those customers will leave to someone who can.  I am not sure about the whole situation on the banning of this person, but if they were banned for only the stated reason that we have been given then MANY people are going to be upset ( more than there are now ) as you do not ban one person and then say "oops we made a mistake..our bad...we won't do it again"  and not try and FIX the mistake.

I am not meaning this to be a direct attack on anyone, but am only stating my observation of the dealings here and why I and others feel very disturbed about such handling of a "unique" situation =)~

Shrpshooter @ 9/2/2002 11:18:00 PM (Armor classes not working like it suppose to? 48992):
Hello! I just want to get some feedback from you guys to see if you have noticed the same thing I have lately! I just ran a mission with my lvl 35 doc and a lvl 40 engie. I have done everything I could to get the best ac's on my doc but relized that I was getting hit for about 10 points more per hit than the engie. After a few fights going like this I asked the engie his chemical ac rating and it was 100 points less than mine but yet I was getting hit for 10 points more. Now if I understand the ac mechanics right, for every 10 points in ac is't it suppose to drop damage by 1 point? If this is the case then should I have not been getting hit for 10 points less than the engie not 10 more? Please let me know if you have run into this problem    Thanks

Meligant @ 9/2/2002 11:26:33 PM (47983):
I got like 12 cloaking devices in the bank.  Ban me?  How else do we save new ones for later?  How the hell do we get a new one in a mission without deleting the old?

I thought the "unique" tag was so you couldn't HOLD and USE 2 uniques on your character (in bank not counted on purpose)?  Is this still not the case?  If it is not here is my list of things to un-unique.

1.  MA Attacks
2.  Cloaking Devices (fix the swap "exploit" first)
3.  Just about everything else in the game

PS - Please define (or redefine) what the FC definition is for the Unique Tag and what it is suppose to a) Do and b) imply. 

Thanks.

gnuman @ 9/2/2002 11:32:02 PM (47983):
What does unique mean?

Does it mean this item is the only item on this server of this kind? Does it mean I am a unique person if I got this item? Does it mean I can only wear one of these items? Does it mean I can only own one of these items? Well, I got an idea what it is SUPPOSED to mean. But how can we be sure? It has never worked EVER, and it has never been explained. Its just a flag on the item. 

Just like the special flag. Anyone know what that means?

Its a flag in the database, you can't expect people to know what they mean. And you can certainly not expect people to accept that you ban people on it when you never explained the flag and when it never worked.

Your socalled workarounds to have more than one unique on you is to store it in bank. Well, boohooo - I must say. Thats one big nasty exploit. How dare people store their items in their bank. You realise that most people actually have more uniques in their bank now because your code never worked?

Hell even your ARKs don't know what is going on.
http://www.tpg.dk/download/iq1.jpg
http://www.tpg.dk/download/iq2.jpg
ARK is confirming it is allowed to have 2 unique rings on. 1 week later Demios got banned first accused for duping. When that didn't stick, then banned for having multiple uniques in bank and something duped and then last it got changed into just banned for having multiple uniques in bank.

Okay, you made a mistake. But covering up with new and more silly reasons to keep that ban is a total joke.

The solution is simple and everyone will be happy:
- Explain to everyone want you mean by unique.
- Announce that you are going to fix the unique-code in an upcoming patch.
- Announce that violating the unique-code when it actually works will get in problems.
- Unban the people you ASSUMED would know what you internally know about the items.

Is it really that hard to eat this burned cookie? Is it that hard to admit a mistake? Is it that hard to correct what is wrong? You saw how this is concerning the community on IRC today.

Myze @ 9/2/2002 11:33:04 PM (42539):
Maybe it's just my crat...but you can recast the calm if they still attack after the first calm...and it does work.  It seems that the only really dangerous effect from this bug is the mobs attacking from several rooms away...but this seems to be rare in my experience.  Most of the time, however, that I can ever even tell the bug is in effect is when i sit to regain nano.

Like I said, this may only be my crat

Just have to make a point here, MA Attacks were "un-uniqued" a couple of patches back.  You can have as many different qls of an attack as you like (or can carry) now.  They're still NODROP though.

Poweredge|vault @ 9/3/2002 12:30:30 AM (47983):
I'm in full support of Noer.

As a side issue, I also did a bit of thinking into the times taken for players to "self-apply" the unique item problem. This is all hypothetically speaking.

Lets us say for example that there are 150 slots in the bank. Each slot can hold a bag that contains 24 items. This make a nice total of 3600 items.

Now lets say that it takes 1 second to look at an item and decide if it's the same as the current unique item that you hold. That means that 3600 seconds will pass before you know whether or not you have a version of the unique you are wanting to check. That's ONE HOUR.

Taking this one stage further. Lets say that you want to transfer this unique item over to an alt. In theory, you'd have to check to see that the unique didn't exist in your bank first (before you pick up the item), the player you're passing it to has to make the same checks, then the alt has to make the same check again.

This theoretically means that a transfer of a single unique item may take as long as THREE HOURS.

Don't flame this, as it is purely hypothetical, but given the instant knee-jerk reactions of several of FC's trusted "Sploit Police", you would be up for banning from the time you looted the item, up until you removed a duplicate from your bank.

I also spoke with Cz at some length about the fact that I "could" be banned in the future, not that I want to, or that I have ever (knowingly) exploited. I was told that if a situation arose where I didn't act fast enough to resolve a unique-clash, that I may be banned. (He couldn't confirm that I wouldn't if such a case arose).

This leaves me and many many others with the horrible thought of the Sploit Police tackling them for something that should have be resolved on both a code-level and a community level. I don't want to have this black cloud following me around, in a game that I love to play. Given that 14.5 will introduce the unique tag to more popular items that current circulate the population, this could turn out to be a nightmare. It's like an inverse-lottery... it could be YOU.


All I ask is this of FC. Do NOT ban people for duplicate unique items, until the following conditions have been met by yourselves:

1. The community has a document that states the true meaning of the word UNIQUE when applied to items.

2. The coding has been amended/fixed so as to allow players not to have to deal with something that can and has resulted in people being banned (unknowingly I may add).

3. When existing items are given the new tag, something is put in place to allow the current player base to react to making themselves "on-side" with the Sploit Teams. This has to also apply to people that have spent time away from AO, and may or may not know that items within their banks have now been made UNIQUE. Nothing worse than coming back to the game to find yourself banned for not doing anything.

You have to take responsibility for your actions FC. People are upset at the fact that an active and constructive member of the community has been banned, but they're more upset with the way you went about it, and the lack of grace shown by people that know, it seems, less than the players themselves.

I can see this one turning into an NS Mk2 moment again... someone is going to have to learn from their mistakes.

Kinkstaah @ 9/3/2002 2:33:18 AM (47983):
I dont agree.

Banning someone that you said you wouldnt ban someone for is pretty much lying in my book.

In terms of severity, Deimos has several Dragon armor items for a guild. Actually, pieces of armor that will be made UN-UNIQUE in 14.5

In terms of severity, thats not very severe at all, and we should all be very scared, or amused.

Biowoman @ 9/3/2002 2:37:54 AM (48992):
Its funny biowoman runs around half naked not pants or boots on just shoes.
WIth the omni elites I wear right now 
head 
arms 
gloves
body
my ac tops about 1200 with just them on 
now add in a webcloak and shoulder pads
ac goes above 1700 for me.

my level is 83 doc and wear ql 110 armor and devices 
the funny thing is I did a test on a 50% mission 
mobs hit on avg 55-60 per hit(green mobs)
so i say okay armor is absorbing at least 170 points 10% of the ac(the brunt of the damage)
so i say cool next mob same type non chemical and take off the armor, geez 55-70 min stayed the same and max went up +10 points.NOW I say WTF ????
   Armor is supposed to protect my soft internals but with soft internals.But with said internals exposed and no ac implants or devices only +10 more in dmg . hee hee the ac's were screwey
so to this day i refuse to wear a full suit of anything(justy doesnt seem to matter , for 30 levels i ran around in a thong and the omni med suit with the odd cloak or device for skill boosts.
so if on rk2 youll see me all over as the chick in a thong and looking good in armor GIMME my black thong GEEZ need it to match my elite????

/me hears rumor that thong drops off a dragon in camelot castle

/me hears another rumor theres a thong patch 14.7 (various colors)

/me eats cookies cuz rumors are rarely true

Mercatura @ 9/3/2002 3:41:29 AM (47983):
FC slaps the unique tag on far too many items without rhyme or reason.

The only clearcut item I can think of is tokens.

People could wear 2 iq rings before, why was this nerfed? Forget that "intended" BS which is usually spewed out, plenty of people made it to 200 with them on.

The real genius was slapping the tag on a tradeskill-created set of armor.

Right. And I suppose you always plan for the worst? Do you wear a helmet to bed so you don't hurt yourself if you fall out at night? Do you shower sitting down so you can't slip? Do you never go up stairs, because you can fall on your way down?

I've got *no* items in my bank. Let's say the person I'm passing it to doesn't have any either. Or the alt I'm passing my unique item to. So checking for unqiues would take, let's see, no time at all. I guess it's all right then with the uniques in bank issue.

Hypothetically, I'm providing constructive criticism. I can spout off hypothetical situations until I turn blue in the face-and that's fine, if a little noisy for those around me. But when you drag in an absurd situation and try to make it support your argument...well, you can smack your square peg all you want, but it *just won't fit* in your round hole.

engelstein @ 9/3/2002 4:13:22 AM (48992):
This is why you wear armor for the bonuses. MK2 is so popular because after 3k or so AC just really doesn't matter, and an extra 1k life sure as hell does. Same thing with carbonum. The bonuses are *very* nice for casters.

OllieG2 @ 9/3/2002 5:45:33 AM (Ring of Power - Physics (no increase in damage) 49047):
The Ring of Power - Physics, it's supposed to increase three types of damage.  My Doc only does poison damage.  The chat window shows that the damage output of my poisons is the same as the stated damage, instead of stated +3.

I don't know if the bug is that it does nothing to improve damage or if the bug is that I'm not supposed to be able to wear it but can...

Shrpshooter @ 9/3/2002 6:28:44 AM (48992):

Firelle @ 9/3/2002 7:09:12 AM (Bureaucrat Limited Worker Droid 49055):
Hi. I'm having problems with my crat's pet. It's a QL 1 Limited Worker Droid, which you need a 22 in MatC and T&S for. I have 22 in both. When I cast the nano, it summons a QL 3 shell, which you need only a 20 in MatC and T&S for. Obviously, since I have 22, I have more than enough.

I then click on the shell, and make my droid, who says he's ready to obey my commands. However, when I give him a command, he doesn't recognize me.

Does anyone know what I could be doing wrong? 

Thanks.

Octo @ 9/3/2002 9:01:17 AM (47983):
Ok starting to ban when people have more uniques in their inventory (bank, inv or equipped)? Then PLEASE consider doing this in preparation BEFORE you start doing this:

1. Make a small check each time a character logs on for unique items in ALL Inv's. If there are more than one instance of any item, automatically list that items to the user and request that the player remove one of the instances. Its VITAL that the check lists the actual item in question, and not just states: "You have several instances of an object with attribute UNIQUE. Please remove one (or more) of the instances." If there are more than one item, list all items as a separate warning.

For example: "You have several instances of: "Bracers of Reflection - Energy". Please remove one (or more) of the instances".

2. Set a grace period after implementing this, in which you will NOT ban anyone for having more than one instance of any unique item. 1 or 2 weeks for example.

3. Keep the check in for some months, then remove it later on if deemed "not needed anymore".


And why do this? Because ALOT of the characters have a filled bank with bags, containing hundreds of items. It would take alot of time to check all the items for the unique attribute, and then check the rest of the bags to see if they got more than one. Lately there have been, and will come, changes to the attributes of items to UNIQUE. You CANNOT expect the players to check their bank of ALL their characters each time a patch comes along. Its simply not an acceptable solution from the players point of view. As goes for myself, I got about 15 characters spread over 2 accounts over 3 dimensions. Many of them have limited inventories, but what you are in fact doing here is forcing me to log on every char at every patch to see if you changed attributes on my items. 

Seriously.... Can you see the problem?

Octo @ 9/3/2002 9:03:19 AM (47983):
Oh and one other thing:

Remember that this game is made FOR the players and not for the developers, customer support or whatever.

We get the game we want, you get our money. Im fine with it, as long as you dont impose actual work on me for every change you do. Just to make it easier for yourself.

Just like the special flag. Anyone know what that means?

Its a flag in the database, you can't expect people to know what they mean. And you can certainly not expect people to accept that you ban people on it when you never explained the flag and when it never worked.

Your socalled workarounds to have more than one unique on you is to store it in bank. Well, boohooo - I must say. Thats one big nasty exploit. How dare people store their items in their bank. You realise that most people actually have more uniques in their bank now because your code never worked?

Hell even your ARKs don't know what is going on.

ARK is confirming it is allowed to have 2 unique rings on. 1 week later Demios got banned first accused for duping. When that didn't stick, then banned for having multiple uniques in bank and something duped and then last it got changed into just banned for having multiple uniques in bank.

Okay, you made a mistake. But covering up with new and more silly reasons to keep that ban is a total joke.

The solution is simple and everyone will be happy:
- Explain to everyone want you mean by unique.
- Announce that you are going to fix the unique-code in an upcoming patch.
- Announce that violating the unique-code when it actually works will get in problems.
- Unban the people you ASSUMED would know what you internally know about the items.

Is it really that hard to eat this burned cookie? Is it that hard to admit a mistake? Is it that hard to correct what is wrong? You saw how this is concerning the community on IRC today.

To ban a person on such a vague issue that you yourself isnt 
totally clear on, is a a much to drastic measure.

You could atleast give a proper warning that you will enforce new 
rules that concernes alot of people. 

Demios is a respected player in the AO community and
one of the nicest and most decent person i've met in this game.

Banning demios on these grounds seems nothing more then
a personal vedetta. 

I couldnt care less about the items allthough it is guild 
property which we have worked very hard for. Since there 
is no way to store guild items, Demios was the unlucky one
that was given the task of storing it. 

This is a trivial matter that 100's of people playing AO is
guilty of and does not warrant a permanent ban!!

This is a discrace.
Do the right thing and unban Demios now.

Claire

Cz @ 9/3/2002 11:04:03 AM (47983):
Mandor, feel free to send me an e-mail with all the names of the people you feel have been "banned for this reason" without notice. I will look into it. I can't give you an explanation though, as I can't give you information about the status of another customer's account, or the reasons for the status.

Nostra343 and Zeronx, I agree with you, and my statement was used to shut off yells of "liar, liar" in the thread and get breathing time to get the point through. I got that, got my explanation posted, and Noer and Azzazzimon understood my point (I believe).

I will not ban people directly for calling me a liar. I have very thick skin when it comes to such issues. However, when flammable cases like this hit the bulletin board, I will do what I have to to keep them confined.

Zarch, Noer, Azzazzimon and others, I will not comment on specific cases (legal matters regarding customers' accounts). Due to this, I can't discuss the case with you.

Dscaper and Octo, I've already stated in the announcement currently on top of all forums here on the bulletin board that we will not ban people for owning several of the same Unique item. I also listed an exception, which I doubt will be very strictly used. We do ban for other issues though.

{Edited for bad English.}

DO NOT BAN PEOPLE BECAUSE OF YOUR FLAWED CODE! Fire those instead that can't program properely and fire those that base their reasons for banning people on pre-assumptions instead of investigation.

Unique means you can only own one at any time, no matter where it is stored. This in answered in my announcement currently at the top of every forum.

In-game you get the text "Your trade partner already has this unique item..." when trying to give a second Unique item to somebody who has one in his inventory. And yo get the text "You have already got this unique item..." if you try pick up a second of a unique item already in your inventory.


	
		
			
			
				Just like the special flag. Anyone know what that means?
			
		
	
The Special flag doesn't have any rules connected to it. It is mor or less just set to 'hide' the QL of an item, I believe.


	
		
			
			
				And you can certainly not expect people to accept that you ban people on it when you never explained the flag and when it never worked.
			
		
	
We don't expect people to accept it, and we don't do it.

Explained it, and will check on the code fix. Violating the Unique code will probably get you in trouble now too, if you fail to comply with a warning. The ban / unban will be taken on individual cases, not as a general "let's unban them all" amnesty, based on the facts in the individual case.

So we should let the people duping 100 billion credits stay in the game, and continue to exploit? I respectfully disagree, and don't see much point in arguing about that.

And, as far as I know, we don't have people who "can't program properly", unless you define "program properly" as "making 100% flawless code", in which case I doubt you will find many programmer who can "program properly" at all.

That is exactly what you did. You banned a person over stuff that never worked and never was explained how it was supposed to work. And as you can see here we don't accept that kind of treatment. We are afterall paying customers and not a charity-institution.



	
		
			
			
				Yes. I also understand that people have two of an item that wasn't Unique when they got it, but is Unique now.
			
		
	
Or items people just dump in bank now and then. I suggest you try it out yourself. I seriously can't remember myself if I got more than one Omni Interops coat on me. I just dump the junk in my bank now and then. You make it sound as it is rocket science to get around the unique flag. Well, it isn't.

Read this a few times. Was there perhaps any other bannable offense (however unvoluntarily it might have happened) that Demois had experienced?

I don't bother this anymore. Good bye Funcom. You got one less troll to worry about. I had one thing left in this game, my friends. Rest of the game has been tried 10 times forward and backward. And now you start doing bull**** on the people aswell. Well, then nothing more keeps me here.

I don't envy your job Cz, covering up and making excuses for incompetent people banning people without even having a clue on what is going on. I just warn you, players don't take that kind of treatment. As said before we aren't doing charity here. We are paying to have a game not for you to have a playground. Spend your resources on fixing your game instead of spending it on banning people hurt by the bugs and then spending additional time on covering it up.

Darkbane @ 9/3/2002 1:09:25 PM (47983):
Seems most of this discussion isn't about so-called unique items, but about someone that got banned. Not going to comment on that but would be very suprised if there wasn't good reason.

As to the uniques thing... another partly implemented feature causing trouble. By all means, make unique do what it is supposed to do (I'm perfectly aware of what that is, and have been for a long time, I'm also perfectly aware of how well it works). I would suggest revisiting the items that have unique on them.

Take Flurry of Blows... there is no reason for this being unique, you can't actually make use of more than one at a time since it locks a skill, and as its purchaseable in shops, it just adds insult to injury. Thankfully you removed unique from MA attacks, which made no sense either.

IQ rings are an example of an item where unique is appropriate, as are many 'special' items from bosses and unique mobs.

I'd suggest that you put up a list of all items currently in game that are unique, link to it from the launcher, and ask players to delete or sell any excess items. Do this at least 2 weeks (a month would be better) in advance of fixing the unique flag to give people plenty time to sort themselves out.

If you do that, the you should be able to delete any excess items in a player's bank (lowest ql ones first) or inventory without any fuss as you'll have given plenty of due warning (do state in the launcher exactly what will happen to items that are still non-compliant).

Nai @ 9/3/2002 1:37:55 PM (47983):
I want Demios back, please return her to me. Risk of sounding selfish...I need her becasue she is one of my main reasons Im still in game. She has allways been so kind to me and I hate to see her threated in this manner.

I will NOT go trough my bank to check if I have some things that Im not supposed to have 2 off. I will NOT do so on any alts either.
I will however not, if so should be the case, use anything to benefit me in any way that would not be possibel whit a properly working code. I will of course delete anything that I should not have 2 off If I should see it and I will delete anything that I get a official warning from you.

I have a strong gut feeling that someone told FC and knew very well that Demios could get in troubel for this, even if its something all have to a extent, dual of unique items. If this is the case then this person should have extensive knowledge about who the poor thing was that keept TC dragon armor. If some is behind this you can go to hell and If I ever get the name I will start a war against you that will make you wish you NEVER was born. I so really hope I get some names so I can unleash some rage and by god I will hurt you so bad.

Sincerly yours, Naishee

Ps. Love you Demi  Ds

So we should let the people duping 100 billion credits stay in the game, and continue to exploit? I respectfully disagree,
			
		
	

No we shouldn't,  I concur with those sentiments. You exploit, you lose your right to play. Seems simple to me. However, someone in your organisation doesn't agree.

And, as far as I know, we don't have people who "can't program properly", unless you define "program properly" as "making 100% flawless code", in which case I doubt you will find many programmer who can "program properly" at all. 
			
		
	
You are aware of that you just proved my recent point that you assume that people are out to cheat? 
And by proving my point, you are also saying that Funcom's programmers "can't program properly" since Funcom are concerned about the programmers constant inability to release frequent bugfixers\or\bugfixes, which any other decent programmer would do as soon as bugs has been found in the code. Which leads me to a different question, what purpose does the test server serve then if not to chase for bugs or potential dangers (exploits) in the code? Not to mention the internal test server. Am I clear or do I need to explain this, slowly, to you? 

And let's be realistic, shall we. Anarchy Online was released 21th of June 2001. Since patch 11.x, Funcom has altered the orginial contents of this game to something that looks like a bad sci-fi Everquest-clone and you haven't still fixed major bugs like duping. 

Now, do I want to buy the boosterpacks\shadowlands or recommend my friends to do so? No, I am already level 200 and reasons for continuing seems rather distant as Funcom denies that their code is buggy and decides punish "bad" players instead based on pre-assumptions instead of investigation. And I don't want to know what Funcom and their "talented" programmers are going to introduce us to in the expansions.

gnuman @ 9/3/2002 1:53:47 PM (47983):
Yes, exploiters should be banned. No questions.

But is a person that gets a nano aid duped in a server crash an exploiter? Funcom stated to Demios that the item that got duped was unimportant. Well, would you spend your time duping firstaids and useless items if you were exploiting? Or does it more look like something that happened in a servercrash? It is legal to use your brain and common sense when looking at these issues.

Schu @ 9/3/2002 2:02:52 PM (47983):
Noer: Yes I agree entirely. Once I traded a pistol in a bag and the recipient said "wtf you gave me 20 guns". 

I gave him one gun. Had I been banned for whatever the hell occurred during that trade I would not have been a happy bunny.

Schu, as you being 99.99% of the population, do you even know why, how, how much what when and fhnebw I did?

If not, you can come intro irc.funcom.com #anarchyonline , give me a tell and we can sit and talk for about 10 minutes describing to you everything in detail.

Schu @ 9/3/2002 2:43:48 PM (47983):
Cloudeh, I have nothing against you personally. We used to team up at Medusas way back in the day.

My reply was to Cz and his assertion that Funcom do not want exploiters playing their game.

The email you posted from Funcom accused you of exploiting. Your return to the forums said something like "Yeah Genevra let me play again, but not with that account".

I have no idea whether or not you exploited. I am not making a comment or judgement on your past behaviour, but on Funcom's. Do you see the difference?



Edit: btw, what is "fhnebw"

Darkbane @ 9/3/2002 2:48:31 PM (47983):
I doubt duping caused by server/network instabilities is something that can be prevented by any acceptable method (in terms of system resources). I guess safest thing to do if it happens is to delete the duplicates (think I'd transfer the one I wanted to keep to the bank and then save & zone first mind you...)

Simply having something get duped in a server crash certainly isn't exploiting. Making use of that duped item however would be. It doesn't matter what the item is, it would still technically be an exploit. There are degrees of severity of course...

Schu @ 9/3/2002 2:51:09 PM (49047):
I read here once that rings do not affect nano damage (nukes DoTs etc) but only weapon/fist damage.

Can't vouch for that, but it might be why......

I have nothing against you as a person Cz, but you are the only FC employee that post in this matter so when I direct anything to you, I direct it to FC.

You take all this time and answer many of our posts here, I really think that is great.

But what you don't seem to get is that FC have made a huge misstake (I don't expect you to admit it) and banned one of the nicest persons ingame, if Demios would have exploited, then I think she should have been banned, but what have happend is that she got an unimportant duped item, she probably got it with a server crash, I think everyone that have played for more than afew months have atleast 1 duped item and she also had more than 1 of an unique item in bank.

If you have an unique item on you, you can't trade or pickup another, but if you have it in bank, it's nothing that stop you to just open bank and put another in, how should she have known that she was exploiting by opening the bank to put another item in?

Unique item= can't use 2 at same time, store all but 1 in bank until you need to use another.
That's the signal you have given us all the time, and now you suddenly decide to ban a person for doing what everyone have done for over 1 year, having more than 1 unique of same item in bank...


Can you tell us how we should have known that you can get banned for having 2 unique items in bank, when you(FC) didn't tell us until AFTER you banned a person for it?

I'm gonna use a player term here, since I'm Community and not PR; That is completely BS.

We have nothing against Demios, or The Council. I personally respect both a lot. To assume we have anything against either is far fetched at the least.

I respectfully disagree. While I would have no trouble dealing with - and answering - a statement like "Funcom does not care", a statement like "Cz does not care" would be unneeded, unfounded and based on little else than frustration and the need to lash at somebody, guilty or not.

See my point?

Arinia @ 9/3/2002 4:49:17 PM (47983):
Well, you guys have a number of issues to work through.

1) Main issue I see is that Cz edited the post at http://forums.anarchy-online.com/ann...s=&forumid=185 to the total opposite meaning of what he posted on Friday.  I.e. "we will not ban people for having multiple uniques" to "oh yeah, we'll ban them if we see fit".  Totally unprofessional and rediculous.  Even today, your posts smell of another upcoming "policy change", i.e.:


	
		
			
			
				You don't get banned for this [having 2 of the same unique in bank]. At least not for this by itself.
			
		
	
2) Communication.  Obviously you all have some serious problems communicating within your company due to the multiple changes in ban reason, and multiple policy changes on the situation in a matter of days (see #1).

3) The thought of a ban for a bug that has been in the game since unique items themselves is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard of.  Over a YEAR has passed and the bug still isn't fixed, and all of the sudden out of the blue, you start BANNING people for it?  OK, granted the reason for Demios' ban has probably changed by now (again), but that's besides the point here.  This is a general issue and her case only serves to illustrate my point.

4) The "other" issue, banning people for duped items/bags.  I have news for you.  Stuff dupes all the time.  Stuff also DISAPPEARS all the time.  You don't see every person who has a bag disappear in a zone crash cancel their account; I sure as heck wouldn't think everyone who has a bag dupe in a zone crash would get banned.

5) Most importantly, I think you're going to realize what deep $@#^ you're in, because all I hear from high level people is "the reason I stay in this game is because of friends, not because of the game itself".  You all have some major problems if indeed that is true.

I'll take that one on my own shoulders. I based that announcement on what info I had, and later got told that extreme cases would be a different matter.

However, I never said "oh yeah, we'll ban them if we see fit", but I guess you mean to show what you feel it sounds like.

Zeronx @ 9/3/2002 5:04:32 PM (47983):
Okay I am going to TRY my hardest and make this my last post.  From what I have read lately there was more than just the stated reason for the banning of this person.  And now know that the reasons (other than the mentioned) are not allowed to be discussed or mentioned for legal reason.  This I respect and know a good deal about but won't go further into it than that.  Hell it's like news reporters at a news conference with Donald Rumsfeld asking What are the next targets and when are you going to attack and what locatins and how many troops do you have and where exactly are they and can I go there and count them.....NO DAMNIT I am not going to give you that info as it would VIOLATE security ! 

What I have also seen is Cz trying hard to be answer all questions in regards to this matter, but still the attacks directed towards him are becoming direct attacks on him (it seems), and that is not constructive nor is it helpful.

We all get frustrated at times and sometimes say things in the wrong way, but trolling a board and posting the same stuff over and over again only to keep picking at a wound that is trying to heal is going to make the situation worse in the long run.  

Cz thank you for answering to all of these questions,  But I do seriously hope that we can get a further detailed infomation posted and notice given to players as to the full definition of the unique items and also say maybe if some kind of inventory button could be added to the bank window that would show you when you pressed on it what all items were in your bank and the flags on them (Unique, No Drop, Special...etc) and that way it would help people to not only keep track of their items and find items faster, but also help them also recongize an item or instance that shouldn't be like 2 unique items of the same kind.

Zeronx

Biffstatsnugly @ 9/3/2002 5:12:19 PM (47983):
hmm... seems to me that a big part of the problem to start with is that, having 2 uniques on the account was even used against the player. 

To be honest i always thought that the unique tag was used for balancing purposes. IE. no 2 iq rings on at same time. Im almost positive i have 2 of the new omni coats in my bank somewhere. I collect tons of trash and never really sell till my bank is so full of packs that it takes me a day just to sort through them all. Usually use alot of it for guildies, re-rolls, or some noobie that runs by asking for a hammer or something.

My point is i would hate to see that as a reason attached to a ban email for me, even if other reasons where stated.
It takes away from the validity of the ban, and brings doubt into something that should be cut and dry. A player should not be nit picked into a ban. Then Funcom would not look like they are trying to Trump up charges or defame a player by placing other questionable instances to create a profile which you could then easier ban with lesser charges.

Dont know just my 2 cents.

gnuman @ 9/3/2002 5:13:56 PM (47983):
Of course people get frustrated when they can't even get told why they are banned. And/or the reason keeps getting changed. How can you defend yourself against dupe-accusations when you can't get told from the exploit team what you are supposed to have duped? You get told it was a bag, but nothing specific and they keep changing reasons. Does it sound like they really know what they are doing? Well, not to me.
Still just sounds like they did a mistake and too proud to admit it.

And Thantos911, I couldn't agree more.

Comparing Demios' case to that of 100 billion credit dupers, is by far the worst example i've ever heard, how can you honestly compare the 2??? 

I agree no one is perfect, but you should not punish Demios for this. This is nothing compared to that credit exploit... *sigh* and you don't even call this an *exploit* it's a *bug*... :P 

What you have done is created an emotion within everyone, WILL I BE NEXT??? for something as petty as this. The items were not duped, they were merely all on one account. I agree totally with Noer the solution here is so simple....

Yes, absolutely. I for one feel I cannot relax until I have searched and cleared every characters' bankbox and inventory. If I don't I apparently risk a ban.

Having upwards of 40 different characters over 2 accounts, 3 dimensions and the test centre, that is a task I am not looking forward to.

No, you risk a warning. If you won't comply, you risk a suspension. You do not risk a ban, unless you (as stated before) have an extreme case (I personally doubt you risk a ban even then), or you refuse to comply with the warning (in which case I think a ban will still only be used in extremely few cases).

As a side note, I'm going home for the day. Might log on from home, but just though I'd let you know that I'm not ignoring the thread.

Poweredge|vault @ 9/3/2002 6:00:30 PM (47983):
Will someone at FC please give me information on the following:

What items are deemed to be "serious" or "extreme" when duped?

What set of circumstances have to unfold for a player to be banned?

If you don't give the community answers to the above 2 questions, then you can expect quite alot more back-fire from the community. If you don't give the community reasons as to why people are banned, then how on earth do you expect people to trust you to catch the real exploiters. How can you expect the players that behave themselves to be able to trust that you'll make a good call?

If you're going to ban people for unique breaking, then you'd better get a macro for banning people, because I can guarantee that there must be hundreds, if not thousands of players that have unwittingly and unknowingly broken the unique system. Not every player HAS to read these forums, and many that do will never read any of this thread, never mind understand the perspective of where FC applies it's Unique ruling.

As for coding a checker to see if unique already exist on a player, and it not being 100%, then you've got more problems than you can possibly imagine. FC have to write code for this... stat.

What amazes me more than enything else is that FC can't fathom the idea that they are wrong. This reared it's ugly head once before with Claire's NS Mk2 mishap, and only when things had died down sufficiently for only a few people to realise that it had been rectified, did they act properly.

You can't go around making up rulings on the fly, when you're effectively playing with other people's finances and enjoyment. Otherwise you soon come to realise that you get a name that sticks with you for a long long time. Verant is a prime example of what can happen when the game providers act on-the-fly, rather than being sensible, reasonable and rational.

I feel for you Cz... you claim that FC are fully behind you, but even as this issue has developed to this point, you have the goal-posts moved on you from people high up in the heirarchy. What's worse is that every time they change their stance, it affects us far more than you could imagine.

Give us the information that we need to be able to continue. You know EXACTLY what we mean. And don't hide it away in forums, and such like. If it belongs anywhere, then it HAS to be on the login screen in massive bold type. Whispering over over channels and burying it amongst posts and irc spam is a sure fire way to fail.

Yes, I apologize.  I went through great lengths to make sure my post was solely factual information, however I let myself get overzealous and forgot to add that the quotes were mine.  I specifically was trying to avoid lawyerism as to the wording of my post, but that failed 

At any rate, the quotes were mine.  And in my mind:


	
		
			
			
				We will not ban people for owning several of the same Unique item, unless we see that they are deliberately circumventing the Unique property.
			
		
	
means...  "Funcom is the judge jury and executioner in these cases.  If we want you gone, you are gone, plain and simple."

Obviously from the number of posts and issues brought up here, this is an issue that is important to your playerbase -- Clan/Omni/TC/Non-TC.  And what do you do?  Get extremely defensive at every turn -- instead of listening to reason and to the interests of your play.. er... customers.

Ok, well making a comment like that in a thread like this wasn't really needed... =) I took it as a comparison that if Demios got unbanned you should unban those credit dupers as well. I'm mistaken i guess.

But still you have everyone worried about being banned now. You honestly don't agree that this is a petty reason to ban someone? You say we don't know the whole case, legal stuff etc, well if your baning her for some unknown reason, wouldn't it be wise to tell us? I mean I could be doing that same thing as her and not even know it? 

I think everyone on this thread wants a happy ending here... You included, why go against what everyone is asking for? I also believe there are hundreds of people that probably don't even read these forums, so if they missed your *explanation* of uniques, they will get banned too?

I've heard countless times, fine *DELETE* the items from demi's account and let her back... even tho I feel funcom is *stealing* items from us regardless... so be it, we just miss demi!!!!!!! what is wrong with you guys??? =) why does everything have to be monumental battle......................... why do people have to *struggle* to play this game......

As far as I understand, duping is duping. I believe I have only used the "extreme" word as a factor when it comes to multiple Uniques.


	
		
			
			
				What set of circumstances have to unfold for a player to be banned?
			
		
	
Quick list:
1. A reason for suspecting exploiting, which starts an investigation
2. Proof of exploiting found.

(That is only regarding banning due to exploits. Harassment and such is another issue, though quite similar in the process.)

Feel free to add questions. I'll see what people are wondering about, and what I can answer or get answers about. If it's a lot (not connected to specific cases) it might even become an article, for all I know.


	
		
			
			
				If you don't give the community reasons as to why people are banned...
			
		
	
In a general term, we are able to give examples. We can never say "this is a complete list", as we then say "anything not on the list won't get you banned" and people will find a loophole.

We can't give reasons for a specific ban to the community. It should be given quite clearly to the banned person though.


	
		
			
			
				If you're going to ban people for unique breaking...
			
		
	
For the n'th time; we're not.


	
		
			
			
				FC have to write code for this... stat.
			
		
	
Couldn't agree more.


	
		
			
			
				I feel for you Cz...
			
		
	
Thank you. I feel for the community too. I know I would be frustrated in your position, so trust me on that one, please.


	
		
			
			
				Give us the information that we need to be able to continue. You know EXACTLY what we mean. And don't hide it away in forums, and such like. If it belongs anywhere, then it HAS to be on the login screen in massive bold type. Whispering over over channels and burying it amongst posts and irc spam is a sure fire way to fail.
			
		
	
As I said at the top, maybe an article is in its place? I'll bring that up.

Ok, now I'm going home.

Schu @ 9/3/2002 6:15:42 PM (47983):
No, you risk a warning. If you won't comply, you risk a suspension. You do not risk a ban, unless you (as stated before) have an extreme case (I personally doubt you risk a ban even then), or you refuse to comply with the warning (in which case I think a ban will still only be used in extremely few cases).
			
		
	

Riiiiight. Well, ok, thanks for trying to put our minds at rest.
It is still a monumental task, equating to several hours /played time, and one that wouldn't really be necessary if you didn't keep changing the tags on items, and changing your mind on what a tag actually means...

Have a good evening anyway 

Edit: Bleh, tag/flag....you know what I mean

Does anyone know the exact behavior of this crash?
My system doesn't really seem to crash, it just slows down to the point of no return, I get one screen refresh every 30 seconds or so and can't change apps, but the network activity light for the specific machine and on the cable modem keeps blinking at the same speed as before the pseudo freeze.

FC could save themselves a lot of time, trouble, and stink by taking the unique tag off any item that isn't nodrop.

-Players could wear 2 iq rings. So what? They could before. I'll bet dollars to donuts there is a written down statement at FC HQ that they intend to slow leveling.

-Players could swap cloaking devices. So what? They could before. 50 more points in conceal BFD.

-Players could own 2 or more intern op coats, dragon armor, etc. So what? You can only wear 1 at a time.

-Tokens and a few nodrop rares would still be unique, to prevent duping I guess.

Did I miss anything...what else is the almighty unique tag actually supposed to prevent us evil players from doing?

/me hugs everyone.. and leaves

I made up a long post on how horrible Funcom is treating their customers, but I just let it go. A good handful of people have quietly canceled their accounts because of this, not wanting to turn this into an 'unban or we leave!' issue. 

The fact is, this is the way Funcom is, and they will not change. I closed both of my accounts last week when this issue frist came up, and will leave in a couple weeks. It's just too bad it had to come to this. There are so many reasons to keep playing, but an equally large number of reasons to quit.

The good news is that Noer and Steff have convinced me to at least try AC2. So look for a crafter named Tarage. ;]

Next @ 9/3/2002 9:27:03 PM (23768):
I just logged in again today for the first time in months, and was disappointed to find that this bug is still there. While this is not a game-crippling bug, it does limit the options available to players when customizing their hot keys, since only certain keys are correctly suppressed in chat.

Hopefully Funcom will take a look at this problem and get it fixed. This doesn't look like a particularly complicated bug to fix; it is more of an oversight that is most likely easy to correct.

I have known several ppl who got banned for exploits, which is great, as they themselfs knew they did so, and took it there after.

I this case, the person banned dont even know excactly why the ban came bout, and it seems, with the multiple uncoherent explanations served so far, neither does FC by the look of it.

So ffs, give us Demi back ,we miss her!

Nvida @ 9/4/2002 1:08:38 AM (Bad codeing? 49248):
I read an articel at auno.org about "possible" bad codeing in AO. This article was written by a person calling himself Scary.

If anyone at FC reads this, I would be int. to hear if your codeing is as Scarydoll asumes! 

(This article has been posted without asking "scary" first, hope you don't mind if you is reading this)

They're incompetent. Why is that so confusing to you? Almost every single technical aspect of AO demonstrates incomptence. The bad design shines through continually as you play. If you expect the game to do a certain action it will likely do "something", however not whatever you would think it did. Usually or most often, this come to expression through the numerous gameplay disrupting bugs that either result in tremendous lag or even crashes due to memory leaks. (Granted, this might be a result of the combination of incompetent driver developers at the producer of my graphics card and microsofts DX technology.) Well.. back to rant mode. I have not conducted any real scientific studies of the game protocol or anything else for that matter, but if you do examine the bahaviour of the user interface in AO ( mouse cursor and menus on the right ) you will notice that these components aparently havent been separated from the actual game environment ( the 3D objects beneath the UI ). This makes these components lag/stall whenever the game does, causing further frustration with the user. Further more the location of mouse cursor seems to be an integral part of the game protocol, since the mouse cursor lags badly even in optimal conditions. On the other hand I might be completely wrong about all my presumptions as I am basicly just guessing, my final point being: It does not work properly however you chose to see it. 

Oh.. About Aunos statement: Does it really matter what particular situation or occurence he refers to ( or dont refer to ), when theres countless situations in AO that will demonstrate the incompetence of Funcom. 

I still like alot of things in AO though, else I probably wouldnt play and thus wouldnt care about this forum.  

Please excuse any typos and thanks for reading...

I don't know how the crash in question behaves, but here's what my crash does: While playing AO or shortly after exiting, the system freezes and reboots. Upon reboot I receive the message that Windows is unable to start because the file windows/system32/config/system is damaged or missing (have also had one other file missing like this)

It's not possible to repair the windows instance, since it's not recognised as an operating system on the HD, so only choice is to reinstall.  After reinstall, lots of things don't work properly, so I'm left with reformatting and reinstalling again. At least I'm able to rescue all work before I reformat.

Paffy @ 9/4/2002 7:26:42 AM (48498):
Heh like Microsoft cares for Funcom little product.

Sure they like to keep their SP's as compatible as possible but you cant really assure it will work with every software in planet and in this case I think they could care even less, after all they have a competing product themself (AC2 = Turbine/MS).

Anyways, I find it funny that there have been people reporting this to FC earlier and FC has replied:

"We do not support beta versions of software". 

Well do you know it is the purpose of Beta testing to find things like this and report them to software makers/OS makers so that they can be fixed but if the reply is like above, I would just shrug my shoulders and say "**** it and continue to other progs".

Then again knowing how well you heeded the warnings of your own product Beta testers and released a _sub_ Beta program as release.... well what can I say.

Good point, Mercatura. I'll bring up the necessity and purpose of the Unique tag with the designers.


Nabutas, it was not an attempt at concealing information. The case was still being processed, and I didn't want people posting all over the bulletin board based on assumptions while I could not at least be here to read and comment.


Kodiene, if you didn't understand the reason for it, that's ok with me. Noer and Azzazzimon did, which was what I was aiming for.

Predicament @ 9/4/2002 10:58:57 AM (45820):
Well... enough is enough. First time I petitioned about the bug. The ark was a great sport, and told me that this bug has been know for about 6 months (now, that is sometime ago though) so I was hoping that this would be approached officially soon.

But noooooo, no recognition yet. I have also noticed again, that EVERY time I fight certain opponents, this happens. There is no doubt that they do this on purpose. So I have had enough. I will petition every time this happens, just to waste the arks time since I can’t waste FC’s. As a gimped soldier as I am, I have to wait for ages to find a fight I actually have a chance to win. But when it finally appears, it ruined by exploits/bugs. 

To FC: If you try recreate the bug, you need two clients, cause on your opponents screen, it looks like you’re fireing, but you don’t do any damage. 

To Arks: Don’t take this personally; I just want you to note down how often this actually happens. You can just reply me with your pleasant macro’s still.  Cya soon.

To other players: PLS! Help petition when you encounter this. Something has to be done now.

To be continued…

Maximilian @ 9/4/2002 11:25:50 AM (47983):
/me supports Mercatura

Suggestion: Remove that flag from all items that are not necessarily unique in the meaning of your announcement, Cz. (You are allowed to have mutliple of them, but you are not allowed to use multiple of them)

There are items, where the meaning behind the 'unique' flag is not obvious. How on Rubi-Ka do I get an in game advantage of having a couple of different Cloaking devices in my bank account. I pull the appropriate out, when I need/can use it - they don't sell for high credits, neither at shops nor to the community.

Funny side note: How do shop terminals handle this problem? Couldn't you purchase cloaking devices from the devices terminal? - Ahhh, exploit, ban the terminals. 

Serious side note:
I have a character (Pistol Adv, frozen for several months now, created August 2001) which I know of almost for sure that I have several Cloaking devices in my bank account. This guy might be reactivated one day, when 'some' things have been fixed  and I haven't looked into the bank for weeks now.
The day, one of your fun(com) advisors steps to me and warns/bans me for having multiple uniques in my bank account:

#customers = #customers - 1.

Addendum:
If FC declares an item as unique and announces that all multiple copies in bank accounts will be deleted (you have one week to clear your bank account, then we will ...) - fine with me. It is just the fact, that I don't want to have the effort of searching and deleting items in my property after FC changed the rules (cause and effect) - even worse to get punished for something I might have worked hard for in the past that is considered illegal right 'now'.
Just wanted to point out, that I understand, that such things change over time.

So long,

Max(imilian)

Darkbane @ 9/4/2002 12:46:56 PM (47983):
I agree, Flurry of Blows and Cloaking Device are the two that immediately spring to mind. Flurry locks aggdef, so whilst if it was not unique, you could then equip 2, it would be somewhat pointless.

IQ rings don't need to be unique, just make them only equipable on one finger (I believe reflect bracers are being handled this way?)

Tokens clearly need to be unique, and a unique that actually works. I can't off-hand think of anything else where being unique is actually needed.

Coagulator @ 9/4/2002 12:51:04 PM (Problems Receiving XP 49329):
I have to admit I was naive, I had no clue about the "UNIQUE" status of IQ rings and had 2 of them equipped. At the end of EVERY mission I get this message:

Mission Reward: 1.5 Million
you rec'd: 1.1 Million

After petitioning, discussing the situation with 2 ARKs and 1 GM, they concluded that I must delete one ring in order to receive the full mission reward. Please note that this was not the XP cap, as I was no where near level, and a player of lower level (and being closer to his level) rec'd the full mission reward (1.5 million).

Well I went ahead and took off my "extra" IQ rings and placed it in the bank. Unfortunately that changed nothing. I still don't get the full mission reward.

Any thoughts from anyone?

Coagulator @ 9/4/2002 2:11:10 PM (49329):
But then why did a team mate who is 5 or so (Lv 158 I believe) levels Lower than me get the full reward?

I was also told by an ARK that it's 10%, no?

Krneki @ 9/4/2002 2:15:24 PM (49329):
No way he could 

You always get 2 msgs about recieved exp when the mission is done. First being the mission reward exp and after it how much you got out of it. Maybe he missread it or something. But there is no way a lvl 158 can get 1.5 mil reward. He has like 17 mil for a level and max he can get is like 850k.

Krneki @ 9/4/2002 2:17:12 PM (49329):
No, it's 5%. 10% is the exp cap for killing a mob. Read about it here

Drabin @ 9/4/2002 5:56:42 PM (47983):
Funcom uses a system of parser checks to find out if a person has duplicate items, large item stacks that should not be available, and multiple other things.

These parser checks can be easily translated into a "feedback" to the player to allow him or her to correct the problem with bank, reclaim booth, and main personal inventory.

The problem is there are so many bugs and so much unorganized content in AO that Funcom has no idea where to begin.  They unique something and then later on they un-unique it.  They unique common items that are upgradable and cause people to want to save the old one before putting the new one on.

This is just one instance of another bad Anarchy Online "blind date" meets Chodaboy the eradicator.

The game has enough problems without having FC step in and become Mister Fingerslam with the Banning Hammer.

Drabin @ 9/4/2002 6:24:45 PM (47983):
This is just my opinion but pertains to "items" only.  Not credits.

If an item has a unique tag and the bank allows you to keep more than one unique item then until the code is 100% fixed, you should be able to do so at will.

Why?

Because people store items in bank without checking them so that they don't have a ton of inventory on their person and they may never realize they have a unique item when they pick the second one up (or if they do not do inventory of their bank).

It's a bad administrative scheme Cz.  You might want to tell the coders that if a bug goes "unfixed" for more than 2 to 4 weeks then no one should get banned for it.  Letting an "exploitable" bug go for an entire year shows a sincere lack of programming skill on the coders.

Geriatric @ 9/4/2002 6:41:19 PM (45820):

For the record, you make excellent points.  I think the entire reason the UNIQUE tag was added on so many items, and the UNIQUE change made so that you could only have 1 of each item, was Funcom's "quick fix" to the many duping exploits.  That doesn't mean I agree that the items with the UNIQUE tag should have it.  I agree with everything you said.  It's just unfortunate that Funcom's "fix" for their duping problems had these serious side-effects which do nothing but frustrate players and make us scratch our heads wondering "What were they thinking?  Where is the logic?  What is the reasoning here?"

Bah.  Too much to say, not enough room to type it all.  It just stinks.

From what I understand, you need to combine a MRR (say, QL200) with a QL60 PPPE (Shape Hard Armor), which then gives you the end result of MRR (Shape Hard Armor) QL60.

This is intended, I think.  I'm a bit confused about it myself, but one of my guildies has very recently just acquired both PPPE's (for hard and soft) and asked my Engineer's assistance in combining them with the MRRs.  He was told that in order for the finished product to make QL200 armor, you needed to buy a QL200 MRR from a superior shop to combine with the PPPE.

I may be butchering this process, as I have not actually done it all myself, but I figured since nobody responded to your post, I could let you know what I've sort of figured out on my own by helping other people create the pieces to be able to make the armor.

And the PPPE's (hard and soft) only come in QL60, so that may be where the end QL comes from for the MRR (Shape Hard Armor).  Again, could be wrong, but...

It might help to first rearrange, then to save. At least I think it does, based on my experience with macros in the short cut menu. If I make a macro, and stick it into the shortcut menu without saving, it's gone the next time I log on. Make macro, then save, and it sticks. Maybe you could try the same with your programs?

If mathmatically (ac/20=level its good till?) my ac is 45 levels higher than the mob, they *should* hit for minimum nomatter what shade of red, green, grey, orange or purple they are.

Evades must be tied in to much.

Even though Funcom developers aren't the brightest ones around, refering to them as plants is a bit too rude I believe. Yes, uniques will be fixed so you may only own 1 of them. No you won't be banned for having 2 IQ rings in your bank. You might get banned for wearing 2 of them.

And if you've been wearing them for 8 months, since before IQ rings were unique, then what?  Why are people banned for minor crap like this anyway?  I can see if they were doing DOS attacks or stealing passwords, but come now, just remove the exploited item (for now, giving it back if things work out differently with uniques) and let them play on.  

Why is the death penalty applied to the all cases, isn't this modern Europe?  Doesn't Funcom want customers?  All of this punishment could be scaled to the offense, after all, the dispensing of justice by a human process (to ensure fairness) can't be automated, so why hide behind a "Let God sort them out" slogan?

Im wondering aswell. Makes no sense.

RedSonja @ 9/5/2002 1:22:42 PM (49545):
There isn't a problem with AO and WinXP in general.
I was using AO under XP Pro beta for quite a while during my general beta test duties.
The issue is with WinXP SP1 - So the reason your second fix works is because you aren't installing SP1.

As for the first fix, shouldn't make any difference as compatability mode is simply there to fix problems such as attempting to install/run a game and getting the message "Not supported under Windows NT" etc.

Divinecross @ 9/5/2002 1:42:42 PM (47983):
Was wondering where all the omni to fight in camelot went.  After reading this thread I'm guessing they all quit or got banned   Really dont see how you plan help this game by banning all your customers for slightest thing.

Maximilian @ 9/5/2002 1:51:30 PM (47983):
-> Abunari. Totally on your side - there are some strange things going on (presumably). We need global, easy to understand and publically available rules (as far as possible).

Maybe I didn't get your post completely, but if you are asking why FC seems to overreact these days (just rumors and speculation, remind that), I'd say:

Funcom is known for acting very (too) kind/generous to people that exploited - at least, this is their reputation. 
Maybe some people think, that by doing 'John Wayne' style right now, this will improve the situation. On thing for sure (personal opinion), exploiters will kill AO much faster than the lack of content did until today. (much to the fact, that we have such a tight connection between PvP and PvM, what will be changed in the near future)

So long,

Max(imilian)

Veenus @ 9/5/2002 2:24:20 PM (47983):
after all i still wait for an answer cz why u act against your own rules and did not give 1 warning!
u just banned and done....u know u made a big mistake but u are not man enough to undo it.damn why aren t u strong enough to say damn we made a mistake i feel sorry and make my friend unban at once?
wanna know why?
my personal opinion about this is that someone did a personal act against demi .cause u breakin all your own rules and u never answer why. ( with u i mean fc)and u dont do anything to correct that again.u just talk blabla about struff and what could happen but in fact u still havent give us a real answer why a player has been banned for a reason thats not bannable without a warning! 

can u tell us who is that guy playin with his power? i want to point my finger on him and laugh at him/or slap him.


another thing: all these uniques flags are absolutely bull**** on 99% of the items.sorry to say that but none of them is any uber item so not worth to make it unique.so if it helps fc ppl can t dupe  ?okay well done ......why not just fix that bug ? 
and why u never act that hard against the ppl duped stuff and sold on ebay?
oh yeah u did after long time and lots of cash these ppl earned....

damn i hate to write in english......

whatever 

cz show that u are a man unbann demi at once

u know that demi never did anything against the rules and u know she is a damn nice person
and if u dont know u should know now

and u should realize that fc slapped a lot of ppl s faces with again a sick customer policy.......fc for sure win this years golden lemon for best customer service in online games.....make a mistake and instead correcting it bann random ppl or someone thats on the list of someone.


think i am done

EH?? The point of a critical is that it is a strike/shot that hits a poorly protected area and does more damage as a result - ie the intent is for it to be as if it had bypassed armour...

Darkbane @ 9/5/2002 4:21:50 PM (47386):
Thankfully this shouldn't be a problem for long - the current version on testlive has no Whumpas in Tir...  You can get in but you can't get out...

Mercatura @ 9/5/2002 6:21:36 PM (48992):
Myth: Crits ignore AC

Fact: More AC will reduce crit damage. However, since players can't get 15000 AC, some mean ol' boss mob will always hurt you pretty bad.

Myth: AC over 3k doesn't matter.

Fact: Tell that to those 2 RM Bullys and their extra-tall Enf Boss buddy in there. Yes, I'm sure AC doesn't matter when Mr. Boss repeatedly hits me non-crit for 800 and my melee AC is buffed to 6500.

AC over 3k doesn't make much difference on wimpy mobs or when you have rrfe and 2 bracers (which are getting nerfed to 7% btw) but it still does make a difference. AC also basically gets doubled in pvp, so for people whose mindset is only about pvp (these are the same people who demand nerfs based only on how things work in pvp) AC "doesn't matter".

You know what really doesn't matter? Vets  because good evades and some heals gives you all you need to fight them.

RVWinkle @ 9/5/2002 9:31:49 PM (48992):
A while back it was said that the developers would look at defensive skills (evades and parry) to see if they were good enough. Since they put in the text feedback for evasions, people can see that evades generally work pretty well. I propose instead that they re-evaluate AC. An improvement in AC would have quite a few benefits.

1) Bracer 'nerf'
While I think that the changes to bracers in the next patch is a good thing, it does have a negative effect in pvm. An improvement in AC would lessen the impact of lower average reflects.

2) MK II
MK II armor is just plain ugly. Since it's one of the most popular armors right now we end up with a large portion of the population looking like fashon victims. More desireable AC would allow for more variety in day-to-day looks for players.

3) Engineers
One of their strengths is not very desireable. If players felt there was a good reason to have more ac the value of having an engineer in the team would increase.

Mercatura @ 9/5/2002 11:03:48 PM (48992):
Right now 10 pts AC = -1 maximum dmg only

I'd like to see something like this added to it:

100 pts AC = -1 damage total (like an absorb)

This would reduce minimum dmg as well. Maybe put a cap on that though, you can only reduce minimum to say 50%.

Some Vet hits for ~500 on 0 AC, 200 minimum.
Only takes 3000 AC to get minimum.
3000+ AC = vet hits you for 200.
3000+ AC + RRFE = 140

AC "doesn't matter" which sucks 

Now, reduce total dmg by 1 pt per 100 AC.
3000 AC = 200
5000 AC = 150.
3000 AC + RRFE = 140
5000 AC + RRFE = 105.
6000 AC + RRFE = 100. (not 98: "new" 50% minimum)
3000 or 6000 AC + TMS = 50 (With any reflect over ~50%, you don't get the whole bonus from AC absorb, otherwise it would be 0 dmg or near 0, which is too much anyways)

Be nice to subtract 50 from those 1k+ boss mob crits too. BTW, from what I hear about new outdoor mobs, 3k AC with bracers nerfed won't cut it

Unfortunatey Tsk, the end result of combining a PPPE (QL 60) with a MRR (QL 200) = MMR (Specific)(QL 200).

It takes the QL of the MRR.

I have a QL 197 MRR (Soft Armor), and I've combined some other PPPE's so I know this to be the case.  I haven't had the required skill over 800 so I don't know if 1000+ would increase the end result higher than the original MRR QL.

A Dev needs to confirm that a MRR of any QL can finish any QL armor/item.  With as bugged as tradeskills are and if one recalls the Soul Fragment FIX/NERF, we're all a bit wary of Funcom's intentions.

I have no idea who got banned or why. But if they got banned, then e-mail the person and see if they can. will they tell you the truth..

Funcom can't/won't tell.


quickest way to get out of AO is to make millions of credits off of an exploit.

Well, can't really speak for all of omni, but a lot of people who went to Camelot, and organized raids there, where members of TC, or very good friends with Demi. Many of us have already hit the cancel button, and many more of us are waiting to see how this situation is resolved before acting rashly.

As a guild we're already looking at other games to get involved in, and have fun with. If this is the way Funcom wants to treat their customers, then someone else can have our money.

If Demi's account does get unbanned, then you'll probably be seeing some of us in Camelot again soon, but a lot of us just feel like we got punched in the gut for no reason, and are finding it hard to even get on and play anymore. Let alone keep our accounts open.

It gets worse everyday. Funcom has been dragging their feet on this issue for far too long. Demi was last told that she would be receiving an email from the exploit team earlier this week. I just talked with her two minutes ago and she has yet to receive anything. We're really pissed, but holding back some of the stuff we would normally do, because we're all hopefully that Demios' account will be unbanned.

DEMIOS STILL BANNED! FIX! BUMP!

Valoren @ 9/6/2002 5:56:12 PM (47983):
Bump, longer FC puts this off, worse it's getting... 

I feel as tho they are combing every past logfile they can get their hands on to find 1 instance where Demi did some bad exploit to give them a better excuse. Guess what, I don't think you will find anything...

/sniff me still miss Demi! 

What is taking so long to give her a correct reason for the ban? It it because there is none? It's been uh 2 weeks?

The trash king belt also suffers from this problem.

And yes, what you heard is correct. No extra action is required by the player, they simply equip on any char.

Robotic Brains used to do that, but they were eventually fixed.

Tarage @ 9/6/2002 9:21:21 PM (48783):
With the weapon MRRs anyway, QL30 is the lowest QL you can  use to improve QL200 weapons. There has always been a lot of leeway with the MRRs. I imagine because of the insane cost of the MRRs. A QL170ish MRR costs 2mil credits. ;[

OddLogic @ 9/7/2002 1:04:32 AM (47983):
Tarage's post expresses excactly how i feel at the moment too.

The dmg is done already for me, no amount of unbanning Demi will fix that. Clueless customer support and GM's on powertrips dont belong in a massmorg.

Logging in atm just depresses me. I meet all these nice people that made the boredom of endless missions somewhat bearable, and even fun at times  These friends are the last thing to keep me in this game, and when FC start banning them for bogus reasons (you've changed the reason for banning Demios like 3 times now ?), it's hard to keep playing.

Best regards to all the players. And a big BOO to Genevra and everyone else at FC involved in banning Demios. Please don't apply for jobs in any other MMORPG's when FC goes bankrupt, I really don't wanna risk running into you again.

I've experienced the boss warping me back up to him after I went down to heal.  The best way to avoid this is to move 2 rooms or more away from the boss button.  That affords some safety from the boss warp.

Paffy @ 9/7/2002 10:06:34 AM (47983):
My thoughts are similar to Tarage.

This issue has been unresolved a way too long already.

I quit this game few months ago because I was extremely bored and came to conclusion that FC will most likely never get this "right", atleast not before other MMORPGs hit the market and start exodus.

It was my friends in TC (even before I actually joined them) that made me come back to spend time with friends online and after that, it has been the 90% of the reason why I still log in to AO.

This banning of Demios has given us all a pause to reconsider our future plans and it dont take long to look our IRC channel chat that most are downloading or already playing AC2 Beta...

Can you believe it? Someone is actually playing a Beta product rather than your "release" product...

Dunno if its already too late to turn the tide.

yeah the game looks promising, of course turbine is the only game company to have a second mmorpg of thier own. The beta is well.. a beta, its not always up and is riddled with alot of bugs. But in all honesty it is more stable, and is overall better then AO Was after 6 months, no joking here at all.

so far i am having a good time. crafting looks interesting, and if its like AC1 there will be REAL content added every month, as well as quest timers an no camping.

the only thing i am having a hard time adjusting to is no NPC's and no buildings to enter yet. this may change over time we will have to see how we get used to it

yeah this sucks about Demios' consider my AC2 posts bumps, Demi would never intentionally exploit in my opinion. I have known demi since we were both level 30 over a year ago.

she used to sneak missions all day to get stuff and she snuck quite a few for me.. usually when someone is banned FC sends them an e-mail saying why, did demi get one and if she did maybe it would help if noer or the like posted it here.

Odd, yes I am very talented. while the others are so busy leveling i am collecting instruments and playing them in towns and near lifestones. 

Kodein: oh just right click your desktop and arrange icons by: 

uncheck auto arrange and check allign to grid. that will fix you up.

oh and Chik is mine, though i think she is jealouse of my sexual relations with Oddlogic and Ouchhh i will have to speak to her about this.

Zarch, yeah berserker or juggernaught, it's tough to tell because they havent tested the higher level skill trees, and they might do some changes ( in beta they are not nerfs and its just an evil word!)

they implemented the class specialisations, and made it so you really have to watch where you put your skill points. some skills may take up to 5 skill points to train. but this makes for more diverse characters thankfully.

oh and pvp wont be a big part of AC2, they have said that it is there for the people that want it but they will not be focusing on it. the system borrows from AO where there are only certain areas you can pvp in, already people are complaining that they dont want people to be able to escape ( like zoning ) because they can move into a non - pvp zone. it will be interesting to see how turbine handles this.

oh and my favorite thing, it is really possible to solo in Ac2, so if you logon and cant be bothered to find a team.. you can make real progress on your own.

(edited)

I'm always been a beta tester, and Iv tested most of the games that is coming out. about AC2, yes its a nice game, it LOOKS good, but take a look on the skill system. THAT is a big joke, take a look on the gameplay itself. That game is more like EQ and DAoC system, and when you/me have been played AO for this long time now, you get spoiled. VERY spoiled, you know why? I think you allrdy know that answer. yeah Nothinman, do your dancing in AC2, play your music, I havent seen worse emotes in a game like AC2.

ALL you can do is to start flaming FC who lamers and suckers they are. YEAH you do that, just say what you want but remember this: WE DONT CARE!
I bet many of you dreams about FC will go bankcorrupt and shut down, then you can laugh your butts of and say, I told you! hahaha.. You know what? that will never happend! Go ahead, try other big mmorpgs out there, after some time you REALISE how good AO is actually, how good the system is.

Someone said to me long time ago: " If you dont like it, why dont you just quit it and stop whining"

But you cant, becouse you care about this game. Even how much your trying to flame and whine, you still care about this game. So only way to make you feel better is to write bad things about it. Another thing, FC had much up's and downs about patches and how game is growing. After all this time, if you didnt like it why didnt you quit game? Its very simple, but no you didnt.

So do your thing now, write a list who's quitting ao and start to play AC2 or whatever. I have a feeling that after some time I will write this over and over again in AO: Welcome back.

Well, I must apologize, but flaming about people flaming never solved anything Doctor. Remember this, if you forget everything else, it's the game that brings us here, but the people that keep us here.  In the end, it's not the game we care about, it's each other.  The game is only a vehicle for expression and communication.  It's what the game allows us to experience with each other.  The sum becomes greater than its parts.  Its not the game at all, but what the game helps us to do and feel   This includes you too Dr.

LittleHorror @ 9/9/2002 7:36:17 AM (46111):
When the team missions where brought back into the game, there where in the patchnotes that some bosses would have summon powers.

I was summon back to the boss room a few times in the same mission.

The first till third time i was rooted and could press the button to go back a floor than before i could break the root i got summon back to the boss, glad i had a team with me because my nano was low and had no more to heal up.

The fourth - sixth time was because the boss was to hard we quited and ran back to the exit. When i was at the main floor and in the first room (yes the one with the door to the zone) i got summon back to the boss so i ran like a man man to the elevator button and had to run the whole mission without making a bad turn, because i did a few and got back in the boss room again.

Finally i logged and when i came back i was still in mission (even that we finished it) but now i could get out of it without being summoned back.

This happend some weeks ago.

LittleHorror @ 9/9/2002 7:42:13 AM (37504):
I tried a mission some levels above my own level.

I started to kill mobs in the mission until i hit 9% than i realized that i had to log soon so i blitzed it for the mission objective.

After i got the mission objective (search for person) i got a token at 9% this happend around 1 week ago

Paffy @ 9/9/2002 7:43:07 AM (47983):
Drrubika:

I quit disgusted and was away over 4 months without missing the game a single moment. Only things I missed was my friends online and the vacuum it filled for "doing something".

Why did I come back then? I got persuaded by friends who still played. Who still wanted to get me into action and do things with me and have a laugh together.

Being in IRC with people is not same. Its like being on the boat with the divers but staying in it when divers go explore underwater and then talking about it when they are back...

It is the "shared" moments in game that I miss. Not the game itself. When enough people skip to other game, I will too and it seems AC2 is becoming the game to go.

What comes to comprision about other games, well I am sucker for graphics. All the other games in market use old and dated engines with lousy graphics. As of moment, AO still rules in that department but not when AC2 is released, which is the actual first MMORPG to compete with AO in that department.

I would go as far as say that AO had a moment in Vegas when you have all the cards to win but because you dont know how to play, you fail to capitalize. I mean look back? There really isn't any competition to AO even still if you want nice graphics to go with the game. They have had a year to capitalize on it, by correcting other issues and sure they have tried and succeeded in some areas but failed miserably in others.

In the end, I think only miracle will save AO in the long run (1 year from now).

Zarch and da chars

Dr Rubika @ 9/9/2002 8:07:42 AM (47983):
if that is true Zarch, why did you spend all this time in AO? before you met your friends? you have spend houndreds of your time with ao game itself, explored it, talk about it, reading about it and much more. After some time you have seen and done the most of the game can offer you, you start to whining, only then. But remember the first time you was logging in ao. what feelings you had, you fell in love with it or else you would not be here today. I mean if game itself was really that bad you would leave it. Many have left EQ and DAoC and other games, they lost their friends there and starts playing AO. Not many have left AO and start to play other games. It must be a reason for that. People come and people goes, thats will never change. But when you leave, you dont have to start flaming FC about how bad it is couse if that was true you would not be here in the first place.

Valoren @ 9/9/2002 8:11:54 AM (47983):

Can we get an update on status Cz? I don't think Demi has heard anything either...? Just hoping this dies down? or what... gah everyone is cancelling :\

Dr Rubika @ 9/9/2002 9:03:43 AM (47983):
Just want to mention this.

Have you ever thought about why FC dont tell us the reason or why a person is banned? It would be great if they did, so we all know what kind of looser that him/her was. But I guess FC want to spare him/her for that, so if he want to get back later he still can use his char and not to start all over again. I mean if you get banned and they post the reason public who wants to talk to him then?
when a person is banned you think he will admit it and say, yes I did it, it was my fault. No, most of those who gets banned dont say so, they come up with some other reason why they got banned.
Then you blame FC for a reason maby its not true at all, couse the only person why really know the answer is FC and that guy who got banned.

quote from Twicer:
because today, two of his friends left the game, one because she lost 25k IP in a freak accident, and the other one banned for helping people (yes you read that right - banned for helping people, NOT EXPLOITING) and because of THAT, two MORE of his friends are now leaving, and this is his last attempt to get them back. How heartless can you be?..

"A specific way to powerlevel was brought to our attention a while back, as people were concerned that it might be considered an exploit. 

This powerleveling method is now considered an exploit."


Ok, as many say, if we are vague with the community team, they cannot help us, so I ask in return, can you be more specific here? There is more than one way to powerlevel, I want to make sure that we know WHICH is an exploit and which is not, please, and place it on the launcher page too if you could.

Dr Rubika @ 9/9/2002 3:30:47 PM (50395):

Cz @ 9/9/2002 3:36:51 PM (50395):
Sorry, Cat, but I can't post how to exploit on the bulletin board. I'm sure you understand that. If you are not sure whether the methods you know are considered exploits or not, please e-mail the exploits team and ask.

Nietya @ 9/9/2002 3:52:38 PM (Powerleveling exploit?  Why is it... 50403):
Why is it that Funcom doesn't crack down on something that's clearly an exploit until enough people use it that it becomes a problem?  To me, that doesn't scream of designers concerned with the game they're working on, but rather, that screams of businessmen wanting to make the most money they can off the most people, and allowing some people to poison the "integrity" of their game world for the sake of keeping the money these other accounts generate.

From what I heard/read, whatever this exploit was let some people go from 1-40 in like under 3 or 4 hours or something, etc.  Not labeled an exploit from the outset?

How... interesting.

Abunari @ 9/9/2002 4:13:49 PM (50403):
You hit the nail on the head that time.  The exploit team is made up of customer service people, not programmers.  This makes no sense to me, as it doesn't get exploits fixed, it just gets people banned, since that's all the customer service people can do.

This is a poor business decision (well, duh), since you are purposefully excluding customers.

FC needs to learn from Microsoft (maybe not totally, but at least somewhat), and FIX exploits first, and reserve banning for people who are doing very disruptive things, like crashing playfields, etc.

What we have now is customer service run by people who are too close to the game, like the volunteer admins on the old bungie.net who were able to blam (suspend for 24 hours) anyone they wanted to.  Bungie was very worried about this getting out of hand and reviewed each blam.  They never gave their admins perma-ban powers.  And while reviewing each blam, the bungie folks (programmers) would find out as best they could how the problem could be avoided in the future.

FC's customer support people seem to be on their own, and they have total control over the playerbase.  If they are the only ones bringing information to the programmers, then how can the programmers really get a handle on what's a problem and what's not?

Anyhow, sorry to add more to your thoughts.  I agree with you.  FC should have fixed this exploit a long time ago, and partly they tried, but ended up making the game less consistent.  

Perhaps they should just make it so that players can team with anyone at any level, but that the exp/level ratio that is calculated based on who is in the team when the mob dies, and preset it to the exp/level ratio when combat was enters (mob/player aggro/attack started), this way it doesn't matter what happens later on (purposely vague here on purpose, don't want to get banned while trying to fix something that has been broken forever).

Just like with uniques, FC will ban people for this, policing their players instead of fixing the game.  This is a game, not life, wake up customer-service-people-raised-on-EQ!!!  We're here b/c we don't want to play EQ and don't want to be treated like EQ players.  If we did, we'd just play EQ.  

Make fixing the game a priority, not removing players from it.     Yeah yeah, some players should be banned, but get off the high horse, you can fix bugs and roll-back exploited characters and play on. 

Besides, once you know who the exploiters are, you just roll them back often and parse their logs consistently and get the best bug-hunting information around.  heheh, talk about free testing services.

Of course you are, couse its not true you think Im just a looser who just made it up. Well take a look rest of the msg here about what you are saying to others and FC in this case. It's the same, its just talk like I did on that post. Im glad Im not working at FC or I would be very pissed to read msg like this thread and many others here. All you can do is whine. Who's the pathetic?

Yes I made it up just to see how TC react and then maby you start to think a little longer before you blaming anarchy-online and trying to write how bad it. Couse most of this threads are just talk and nothing more. It dont feel good when someone is blaming you for something thats not true? Yeah, keep on post msg's about how sucky this game is, dont stop now!

Out.

Sara79 @ 9/10/2002 1:01:38 AM (46111):
I haven't encountered this enough to be certain, but I think that Bosses can only summon people that they have aggroed. So a good stratagy for this might be to have one person with decent health be the last one to leave a room and make sure they have aggro before they go down. That way they don't necessarrilly kill you.

When you read the forums everyday and many of the threads are about how FC sucks and so on, its starts to get boring. I just cant understand why people dont just quit game and do something else. There are so many others here who really like this game.

btw, whats the big deal with AC2? Take a look on the skill system, how its build.

drdoak @ 9/10/2002 9:21:20 AM (47983):
I think my eyes are going to bleed from reading so much....

You all probably don't remember me,  but I was Drdoak/Ladypizza from awhile ago, banned for reasons some of you might remember. Despite the exploit being used by MANY MANY clanners and OT's alike, only Achick and I were banned (to my knowledge) because of that particular exploit. Even now, the OTHER players who benefited from that exploit are playing, still leveling, have new alts (minus the exploit of course) and have received no recourse for their actions, because, as some have probably been committed to in the past, we became MARTYRS (SP) and were, in a metaphorical sense, strung up on a cross and burned at the stake because of it. We had no chances to defend our cases, no chances to do.....anything for that matter.

Well, when I was banned on my first account I was given no warning, no "conversation with GM/ARK-types", no nothing except an email from FunCom saying that "I have had my account perma-banned for such and such reasons. If I would like to talk about it to please reply to this email. " Mind you, I replied to this email.....
Did I get a response? Of course not.... they don't want me to continue to pay THEM money despite the fact that I got caught and I now learned my lesson.

I have a new account, using the SAME credit card, using the SAME account information, yet still nothing  

I came back to AO because of the friends I had, that seeming to be the major reason at the moment.





What does all this mean? The same thing that many of you have been stating over and over again with no answer given..
Why does FC continue to handle customer affairs in this horrible manner? 

This has nothing to do with you Cz, in fact, I've never talked to you before to my knowledge...
I don't expect FunCom to has the BEST customer support, and to NOT punish people (me) for exploiting, but to completely neglect the customer in every way, shape and form, is grounds for termination in EVERY SINGLE COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR. Customers are #1! They pay YOUR salary. They did something wrong, yes, was it or was it not intentional, that's not appearing to be the point anymore. The point it seems to me, is that there is a horrible lack of customer care in FunCom. Whether it be direct or indirect, it IS lacking and needs some severe work....

(banned, but still in the game!  )

assassimon @ 9/10/2002 9:41:04 AM (47983):
Ladypizza, by just comparing this mistake that FC did with the exploiting you did you show that you don't understand a single bit what is right or wrong and should never been let back ingame.

You used serious exploiting, why would they even discuss it?

Demois didn't exploit anything, FC shouldn't even need to discuss it, cuz he should never have been banned.

Hey, have you heard that the ICC guards are moving to guard Tir now??  We are becoming a Neutral city so that OT can come gank us in the Arena.  OMG!  This is our HOME CITY!

Oh, and I haven't heard that ICC are also making Omni-1 Neutral..  Where is the balance?

Wesky @ 9/10/2002 5:15:08 PM (44929):

Aqua @ 9/10/2002 5:59:28 PM (44929):
there seems to be some lag between what the client sees and what the servers see. A quick fix a crat told me about is to target yourself after every battle to make sure your health is what it truely is. I am not sure if this health lag will suddenly make you die or not, buts its nice to go into a fight at 100% health instead of looking like 100% but really being 50% .

Darkbane @ 9/10/2002 7:40:31 PM (47386):
Yes, the Tir whumpas have just moved, but in one patch the destination point was still the old whumpas which was a bit strange... That was fixed last patch to testlive, so all is well again. Though Fair trade looks a bit odd... Maybe there should be some sort of abstract sculpture up there...

Wahoo. @ 9/10/2002 8:05:01 PM (Health bar and others 50696):
1. The health bar does not show the correct information nor does them team list sometimes.

This seems to happen when team member goes out of range . Now this is nothing new , it would be nice to get this issue addressed.

2. Also , i hate the bug where teammate goes invisible once they are out of range . The only way to fix is have them zone or run out of range again.

3. Sometimes when i sneak to get the uber 10k sneak attack. I get warpped back to the room i was in before but this time the doors are all black. Only way to fix this is to have an engi warp me or relog.

I, (Lilredhot, L25, Omni) can get to the arena no problem. You Clanners should put some guards on the streets between grid park and the arena if you want to make that a little harder. 

From memory, I think clanners can do their same thing if they know their way around Omni-1 Ent.

drdoak @ 9/10/2002 8:45:36 PM (47983):
Nooooo.....I think that you didn't consider reading my reply at all...


What I was trying to relate is that FunCom handled it poorly and did not give us a chance to redeem ourselves. You apparently don't know what I'm talking about therefore I will just not worry about what you say from here on out. Being that a typical response from a clanner =P

Demios - did not get even one chance to explain or have a chance to get her account reactivated

Ladypizza/Achick - same thing

Steffani - Harrassed by ARK's/accused of harrassment when she did not

These are all related in the fact that CS was handled poorly...

Now my best guess here is that you are going to reply with some flame about how I'm retarded and that I exploited and should have been banned anyway blah blah blah, but you know what? Yes, I should have been banned, should I have been treated a little better? Perhaps, but it's neither here nor there, I'm just stating a point that Customer Service lacks in this game. Instead, you assuming I am trying to say something I'm not and then attack me because of it. 

Did Demios exploit? Technically I think so. Did she do it with the intent to abuse that exploit? Most likely not, but does that mean its still not wrong? If you killed someone in self-defense is it not wrong? It's the same thing with the treatment exploit that EVERYONE used. Did FunCom ban a whole bunch of people? No, but they could have and in every respect they should have. It is OUR responsibility as people of the community to find bugs/exploits and then report them and not use them in that same effect. I was not aware that it was illegal to have more than one Unique item on my person at one time. I didn't think about it, because it gave me no message saying, "no you can't do that" or anything like that. I don't keep up with the forums as much as some so how would I know? To prevent myself from getting banned I plan of taking all of my uniques and either deleting them, selling them or trading them as soon as possible so that I have absolutly no reason to get into the same trouble that Demios did.

And like Cz said, he is not allowed to divulge any information about what exactly she was banned for. As far as you know, it was because of something completely different and anyone who told you that it was because of such and such reason, unless from Demios herself, would have no basis, because FC support is not allowed to discuss any information regarding that, like Cz has stated many many times over and over again. However, people don't seem to want to listen.
You ask why? They can't tell you, plain and simple...

Barren @ 9/11/2002 2:29:48 AM (Run/walk bug? 50758):
I'm not sure if this is a bug or not because i've only started playing AO a week ago. WHile holding down on W to move forward, if u hit enter to bring up the message bar then let go of w you'll continue to walk/running. Jumping will stop it. You can turn off hte message bar by hitting enter again without stopping hte walking/running thing. I found this espeically useful in traversing out door terrain. You can also use this trick to do a whole bunch of other actions like strafing, and moving backwards.

If this is an unforseen bug or something, I;d hate to see it removed because it's actually fairly helpful

Mercatura @ 9/11/2002 2:57:52 AM (50758):

Pacman @ 9/11/2002 5:44:07 AM (47983):
Hmmmm this is my first post on these forums.... The reason being that for once I read a post that was so far away from any logic I can relate to. Since I realize that discussing Demios banning is pointless given that FC won't comment, I won't go there. I will discuss some issues in general. This post springs from the following comment made by Cz:

This is true if said in the context that a programmer should be making flawless code as the very first attempt at a task. That would require superhuman intelligence. However this is not the case. The code in question is the code of a game that has been released as a beta and testet by MANY betaplayers who have given extensive comments on flaws, bugs, exploits and others. It is a game with a dedicated test server to try out any new features in the game before launching on the "live" servers. It is a game that has been on the market for over a year and still has more bugs than many betareleases. It is a game that has been patched, repatched and fixed so many times that we by now write 14.5 in patch version and many of the things claimed fixed in varous of these patches STILL aren't fixed. It is a game with a large and active playerbase giving constant input as to what to improve/change and even so I can fill the rest of this post with bugs and flaws currently in this game (don't challenge me, I will do it).

I've been reading this thread in its intirety and analogies seem to be a popular means of explanation so try to follow me on this one:

A big spaceprogram is underway. The launch of a space shuttle into space/the moon/mars/whatever. The project cost a S***load of money and the schuttle is state of the art. Never done better by humanity. Finally the day of the launch arrives. Countdown is done and shuttle lifts off. Unfortunately something goes wrong and halfway out of the atmosphere the shuttle blows up. A lengthy investigation is conducted to find out where the error was so the blame can be placed and the government can get an explanation as to why they invested a gazillion $ in a project that had such bad outcome. The error was in the software controlling the fuel. The programmers are confronted on the issue and the response is: "well you can't expect us to make 100% flawless code!"..........

How many people in the government, NASA, the press and elswhere do you think will accept that explanation? "oh ya thats right, we shouldn't be too hard on them, never mind that we spent the money and gained nothing from it, because we couldn't expect that from them"...... I don't think so....

I chose this particular analogy because I know that, what programmers usually hide behind is the fact that the system they work on is so huge and complex. I don't think the software system for a space shuttle is any less complex.

Of couse it is possible to make flawless code. It may take more money, more time, and more tenasity, but it can be done. I realize that the safety regarding a space shuttle is more important than that of a game, so I don't even expect 100% flawless code, but well into the 90's would be nice, and it certainly isn't at the moment (see earlier threat to list bugs and flaws...)

No matter how you view this issue it can NEVER EVER be the responsibility of the player to compensate for FC's flawed code and in failing to do so risking to be banned. How can you ban players for something that is FC's responsibility?

I'm not trying to defend exploiters here. People who intentionally exploit bugs for their own benefit should indeed be banned, but realize, that with AO being as bugged a game as it is, the burden of proof should be on FC. The evidence should prove BEYOND ANY REASONABLE DOUBT, that the player in question in fact did exploit, for a ban to occur. The reason for this being, that as initial player of a new game, that player can only assume that whatever he/she can do ingame, can be done because that's how it was intended. If this is not the case, all players should be properly notified of this, and only then can evil intent be proven, should a player repeat the action. And even then the exact rule broken should be stated, as well as the specific incident where a rule was broken should be explained in context to the rules

Furthermore, problems arise from the fact that FC changes the rules of the game ever so often.... What was allowed last week is now no longer allowed, what was illegal last week is now legal. This further adds to the player getting the benefit of the doubt, since he/she might not have known the most rescent change of rules.

Bottom line is that as long as FC don't follow the very basic rules of "procecuting" a player in a fair manner, I don't see how they can defend passing sentence on any players in question.

Decide on the rules, publicise them, stick to them, enforce them..... In that order.

It's as simple as that.

And probably *can't* comment... to discuss such would probably be in breach of the law in many countries without prior consent from the individual involved.

Catalyste @ 9/11/2002 8:51:43 AM (47983):
I think one issue still remains, and the last time I spoke with her it was still in limbo:

Demios herself still was not told, as was agreed...not within the time limit, not at all,  as to WHY she was banned, other than "Exploiting."  It's not myself or any of us who need to know, its the person who got banned.

When criminals are taken to court, or even before the magistrate, they are officially "charged" with a crime (i.e. "you are being charged with arson of the Ixnay Factory building."  You can't just have the police show up and take someone away without being told why it's happening "sorry, all we can say is you broke the law, bad bad girl, why did you do it?."  This is not martial law, this is not some draconian dictatorship, is it? Lest we resort to some sort of anarchy (pardon the horrid pun here), people these days who get in trouble or who are even a suspect, are told why, or so I thought.  Where I live we are supposed to be "innocent until proven guilty."  This is not supposed to be some shakespearean "kill all the lawyers" epic where people are guilty until proven innocent.  In AO you can do what you want, but outside, it has to be a different world, methinks.  I am ignorant, can someone assist me?

Catalyste @ 9/11/2002 9:07:10 AM (50395):
That sounds fine.  I am kinda slow when it comes to all this technical stuff after all.  I didn't want to find out the paint was wet if the sign was missing is all.

ntrox1 @ 9/11/2002 9:31:29 AM (47386):
I, (Lilredhot, L25, Omni) can get to the arena no problem. You Clanners should put some guards on the streets between grid park and the arena if you want to make that a little harder.
			
		
	
Lilerdhot, I think you find we're in the same boat as you: we cannot dictate where our guards should be placed.  We've been calling for lvl 300 Grid guards for a long time, but its not happening.  In fact, as you see, the reverse is happening.  I just cannot believe that we are turning Neutral.  The home city of Clanners is Neutral.  OMG!

Loxt @ 9/11/2002 9:38:40 AM (47983):
Well spoken Shedevil/combat =)

As with many others who've posted on this topic.

Funcom's customers deserve an answer on the issue of Demios' banning, as does Demios herself. If the circumstances surrounding this event are not brought to light, there will certainly be a major backlash throughout the community, which indeed is already under way, not the least of which includes the disbanning of The Council, a very respected high-level Guild comprised of many players who I've come to know as good friends.

Friends and comrades can not be expected to stand idly by while those wronged are victimized by an unwitting corporate machine. Perhaps this situation is a result of an error on the part of some individual within the system, or boils down to a simple miscommunication. How else could this be explained?

I for one will allow the benefit of the doubt. For now. But the Paying Consumers will not wait forever; we deserve better treatment than this. Those who are working within/for Funcom, if you pay attention to anything that is being communicated on these forums, especially get this point: Resolve this. Find out what happened and why. Notify Demios. Allow her the appropriate chance to defend whatever action you may have deemed bannable. Then publicly announce the result, and either admit the error on your part, or inform us so we know what actions you took were justifiable.

Think of it this way... we are all members of an online community. You have banned and thereby effectively killed an influential member of the community. As uniformed bystanders, we can only point our fingers and cry "Murderers!" You have the means to rectify this. For your sake, please do...

Well, i know that!! This bug has been here forever. It is one of the top things on the list to be addressed. I would rather have these issues resolved before SHADOW LANDS.

Vernon @ 9/11/2002 8:22:12 PM (Warpie Warpie Warpie... 50942):
Was in Lush Fields today killing thingies, 8 or 9 mobs to ding then got alot of chainagro, ended up killing 5 mobs and being around 40% health when done.

Incomes the Lifebleeder...so, I run towards the entrance of the little static cave on top of the mountain, right before entrance I get warped at about 30% health down to the bottom of the hill....and subsequently ate by the Lifebleeder who magically appeared before me.  (thanks nano skills inoperative)

Question:Is warping outdoors a "feature", or bug?  My ping was green, and stays so 95% of the time...if its a bug, please get rid of it ;d

I certainly have no Warp Space&Time relocation nanos...lol

Nai @ 9/12/2002 5:11:44 AM (50696):
...but I sincerly dont think the CAN fix it. If they could it would have been done for a long time ago since its a dangerous and pretty annoying bug witch all docs/healing classes can say.

Kinkstaah @ 9/12/2002 7:16:30 AM (45820):
Btw, although you dont see yourself swinging, neither do they.

On the server however, you are both fighting.
Try it, Neither of you will see yourself attacking (but you will see the other guy shooting you)

It is funny to see your opponent just fall over dead after awhile.
BUT DAMN ITS ANNOYING.

Borrace @ 9/12/2002 5:07:23 PM (50395):
Merc,

Please see the note at the end of my post...it referred to you.

I wanted to see how many people running win98 would reset their computers.

Loxt @ 9/12/2002 6:01:28 PM (45820):
Kinkstaah's right, although I'm not sure if your specials work, which is particularly a pain when you're running and waiting for the burst to cycle up. Also, it's not 100% this way... sometimes the mob/other player is shooting/hitting you and on your side they're still out of range.

I'm going to take a leap here and guess this is a server-synch issue. It seems to be the same thing that makes mobs jump suddenly from one room to another when in a team mission with a laggy team, or the reason why a member of the team is getting shot by a mob no one else on the team can see or find. Methinks this is part of the price we've paid to eliminate previous major issues such as memory leaks, major "rubberbanding" lag, mobs still hitting after they're dead, etc etc that were prevelant in the earlier days.

If the original poster's soldier indeed is a "gimp" it's not likely he would survive any pvp encounter. I suggest if he is ultimately interested in "pwning" in PvP that he browse through the soldier boards and read up on the best way to configure his character for PvP. The reason I mention this is because if he goes out and loses every pvp match he's in, thinking it's because he isn't shooting, when in fact he is, but the client-side just isn't registering it, and then he loses ultimately because he isn't twinked for PvP.

It's unfortunate that not just any joe player in the game can't at least have a decent match in pvp without having to specially set himself up for it, but that's the way the game is today. For example, a weapon dealing projectile damage like a mauser particle streamer may be great for PvM but lousy in PvP, since nearly everyone has high Projectile ac. On the other hand, the Mauser Chemical Streamer may be much more effective for PvP, since it deals Chemical damage. Other more extreme examples could be swapping implants, getting short-term buffs to use higher nanos (like damage sheilds or MK) or temporarily OE higher QL weapons.

Back to the topic at hand: I think there may be a way to resolve this and reset the client to the server. I've noticed the enemy's health bar is often updated when they recieve nano damage (ie Fixer spcial AOE burst or da taunter/agg enhancer nano dmg, NT nuke, or possibly even general debuff). I don't know if this works in PvP, but client-side seems to reset when nano damage is dealt against the oponent, and the attack spam resumes. I'd be interested if this happens in PvP as well... it might work with a general debuff nano. If you're fighting an NT, explore their nano line before hand and see what nanoskill their nukes are based on, then get a -20 general debuff for that skill. It will not only confuse them breifly and cause them to switch to a different attack (hopefully) but it should also "reset the client."

I can't emphasize enough that this is mostly speculation and requires some testing. I also strongly encourage the original poster to take a week or so off of leveling and spend some time twinking up specifically for pvp as this will certainly enhance his pvp capability, whether the NT is seemingly exploiting or not. Another thought - have a 3rd person observer come to the pvp area with you, and observe the damage dealt by both parties. Your friend could then verify whether or not you are still dealing damage against your opponent even if you are not seeing it on your screen.

I hope this helps, and please update us with more info if you take the time to test this =)

Borrace @ 9/12/2002 8:33:10 PM (45820):
here's an idea!

funcom should fix this bug like it fixes all other bugs...it should remove it from the game!


Funcom Announcement:  All movement has been removed from the game due to a feature not working as intended.

it "worked" for dragon flight, didn't it?

Bionitrous @ 9/12/2002 8:38:56 PM (45820):
Didn't someone say in IRC that they were going to disable Run mode while in Combat?

Was supposed to make PvP more realistic and strategic and fix some bugs that they wouldn't divulge.

Is this the bug?

Borrace @ 9/12/2002 9:33:09 PM (45820):
oh my god! you can't be serious!

fixers would poop themselves if they couldn't run around (or run away) once combat was initiated.

my post was a joke, i didn't really think funcom would disable running! lol...

I am running XP and before yesterday things where working ok (even after the patch things where ok, chat just stopped working while I was in the middle of a mission). My friends can not see me as being on either. I am also unable to access the RK2 java chat client now as well, RK1 works just fine. Someone please help me here.

Divinecross @ 9/13/2002 1:13:40 AM (Bug in grafts 51265):
Not sure if this bug or not.  Grafts have unlimited range and can be excutable on target even if the target is out line of sight.  Is this intented work like this or is this a bug?

Luicfer @ 9/13/2002 3:14:32 AM (44929):
I've had similar experiences.  Mine where while on a mission however.  Getting hit by an unseen enemy, that niether myself nor my team mates can see let alone lock on to.  And when that happens, it isn't like normal combat where you get hit and take damage every couple of seconds, but it's a constant and persistant stream of dmg until you're dead.  Can't escape it either.

This has happened to me twice now since I've started playing.   Fortunantly still being new it hasn't effected me terribly, but I could just imagin a high lvl having this happen when he's close to lvl.  I'd be livid.

Guest @ 9/13/2002 3:26:47 AM (Melee range fixed? 51278):
I used to play with a pal of mine, and we decided to go to the arena when we hit 15ish. I was an enforcer, he was a NT, and the most brutal thing was that I could melee him from a LONG ways away.

I don't know if this was a bug or not, but I was wondering if anyone noticed any changes to this, or could check it out for me.

Thanks!

Tiran @ 9/13/2002 6:57:57 AM (Armor and Attack shop stock bugs 51312):
This bug has been present since 14.2

It has been reported every patch since.

Currently, ARK's are telling me 'working as intended, you aren't supposed to be able to buy armor from armor shops, nor attacks from attack shops.'  Duh.

If you feel this is *not* how it should be working, intended or not, let Funcom know, I guess.  Simply reporting the bug isn't getting any more action than all the reports of not getting max nano points from attribute-derived nano pool since beta got.

Version: (ie 14.5.0.4)

14.5.06 (and all earlier to 14.2)

Summary: (brief overview of the problem)

Omni Armor (and Attack, but only armor detailed here) Shops are not rotating
stock properly

Description: (The problem in detail)

Omni Armor shops do not *ever* offer all the pieces of any type of armor
they sell.  I don't mean at one time, I mean ever, no matter how many times
the stock 'rotates'.

Statistics from 25 checks of Omni Superior Armor vending machines:

Step by Step: (How 'I' can easily reproduce the problem)

Check Omni Superior Armor machines.  Do NOT use gm commands to force
restock, must use normal, available to all of us time based restock.
Easiest to look at is probably Flowers.  Top lines, and only Gloves or Boots
ever offered.

Sidenotes: (here explain your screenshots if you have any in as much details
as you see fit...remember before taking SS's to hit Shift+F9 first So i can
see all the information on your screen. Mission bugs it is VITAL that you
include a SS with that information.)

Playfield machines are found in: 51102:1185

Note that Omni NPC Superior Armor vendors have same stock.  Neutral machines
have different, but still limited to only some pieces stock.  Clan stocking
patterns unknown.

Stocking pattern has been known to change on patching, but is always
'locked' into some subset of full sets.  Attack machines same way, currently
superior attack machines offer ONLY the Angel of Night, Attack of Snake, and
Bird of Prey attacks.  Offered Blessed with Thunder in 14.5.01, but changed
to Bird of Prey in 14.5.02

Naraya @ 9/14/2002 12:14:48 AM (Problem with Nano Resist.... 51504):
Last night, Makyla (clanner smurf) was in the Omni-1 Ent arena wanting a 1 on 1 fight.  Why...I don't know...anyway.

A bunch of us pop in there and knowing that the smurf would try to run, I tried to root.

Now...when we run nanos on an NPC mob and they get countered, we don't know that they are countered until the nano finishes executing and the cost of the nano deducted from the pool.

If another player counters a nano, the return message is instantaneous.  I pressed the hotkey for my root, no execution, no pretty graphics, no expenditure of nano, just "Your nano had no effect on Makyla".  This led me to start spamming the button til I got one out....no nano expenditure until it landed, no atk/rchg time periods in between...nothing.

This needs to be fixed like...quickly.  For one, it is not fair to the defensive minded people as it allows the nano-based profession to spam their way around whatever defenses have been built up.

custom desert reet from the longest road dungeon
This gun fires a random bullet with a self contained nano program that ingites upon impact......well if that happens on the very last shot against a mob you get no experience and no loot.  Thats real nice when you spend all the time to get to the boss at the end of a team mission and the last shot the boss just disappears...no loot, no experience, nothing.  Every time this happens I check and the last shot was the random nano damage from the reet.

It was not considered an exploit before and they said that also. So it wouldnt be fair i guess to bann the people that used it before they announced it to be an exploit.

Ok,  doing solo BS mission fighting a 'green' nt mob.  It is one of two blows from being dead - I am at full health (this is a level 97 missions btw). Next thing that happens is my showing up at the reclaim terminal.  I scan the text messages to see what kill me, but nothing is listing there regarding damage to me.

I think if this keeps happening this will become a major issue. Nothing more fun than spending an hour in a mission - being 90% done and suddenly  - poof-  your dead.

It appears to be weather related but I could be wrong.  It usually is raining during my crash or after I relog on.
I may be wrong but I think I was in third party view every single time I'm going to try to stay in first party view outdoors even tho I don't like it when traveling and see how that goes.

edit: I use windows 2000 not xp.

new exploit: run to a store, buy 10 lockpicks, go to another store and sell them, u MAYBE, just MAYBE will gain profit

Kzak @ 9/16/2002 9:29:39 AM (51865):
Just to make sure:

You are left-clicking on one part, and shift-right-clicking on the other part, to combine them properly?

If you're doing this, and you still get no result, you're likely the victim of a bug.

I don't think you need an apartment key to get a personal lockpick.. never seen anything to indicate that.

Narakar2 @ 9/16/2002 12:55:03 PM (Playful Cub graft problem 51971):
I have a hacked playful cub graft, but I'm having problems using it.

In 8 or so attempts at casting it on myself it has only worked once.

I know I have the correct skills (as its worked once so far) and I make sure that I have no other nanos uploaded before I cast it (as I'm told some nanos can cancel out playful cub).

Is there anyone out there that can tell me how to use this graft reliably?  Being able to cast his graft 1 out of 8 times is frustrating, especially when you have to wait 25 mins between each attempt.

Mharc @ 9/16/2002 3:02:30 PM (51971):
I think when a graft is hacked, the chance of successfully using it drops. Don't know what influences how much it drops, though....

I have a hacked damage modifier graft that hasn't worked once, as far as I know...

Narakar2 @ 9/16/2002 3:20:28 PM (51971):
I also have a hacked feet of stone graft and this works everytime.  So I assumed there must be something strange about the playful cub graft.

From my experience with other hacked grafts they work all the time.

I've had a similar problem with a warp nano on my NT, team warp to omni.  This nano sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.  I just says its executing and nothing happens.  I also have the team warp to rome and it works every time.

I hope I didn't pay 600k for this graft so that my MA can wave his hands in the air for a few seconds and thats it :/

Hypos @ 9/16/2002 10:05:33 PM (50942):
Well, there is a warp like this in the game that can be done by some boss mobs.  But that's not the case here.

It sounds like this was a simple case of rubber-banding.  This happens when your system gets significantly out of sync with the server.  You run around for a while, but the server doesn't get the messages.  During that time, the server thinks you're standing in one place.  If there's a hostile mob around, he's taking bites out of you while you just stand there.  When the lag catches up, you reappear back where the server thinks you are, you get all the lovely messages and then get to watch the nice dying animation.

Just a case of nasty lag, I think.

labrutte @ 9/17/2002 3:17:02 AM (51504):
You were very unlucky to have your nano countered cause nano resist is crapp.
It seems that you need to have 700+ and full def to counter nano...
Plz funcom do something for nano resist, it's a pain to be nuked in mission or rooted and deprive each time in pvp

Narakar2 @ 9/17/2002 10:02:50 AM (51971):
Well I found out what the problem was, and I post this so that others don't have the same problem.

I don't know if this only applies to morph grafts or all grafts, but the QL of the Playful Cub graft affects the chance of whether or not it will work.

I got hold of 3 Playful Cub grafts.  QL83 and 81 seemed to very rarely work.  But the QL199 graft works every time.

So it seem you were partly correct Mharc

Phrexia @ 9/18/2002 6:03:09 AM (ARGH!! Fix the MP's Mezz Pet!!!! 52355):
This is insane. I've been killed just as I was about to level by this buggy pet...I refuse to use them any more. 
Those of you who don't know...Metas have a third pet class....a mezz pet. Problem is, when the mezz wears off, you suddenly take all the damage that you would have if the mob had not been mezzed....all at once!!!!!! So, one sec you are at full health, the next, BANG....a whole list of damage messages and you are dead.

Look, it's bad enough we have to deal with pathetic pet pathing (and flying pets that get stuck on tables), but can we at least have them all WORK as advertised???

I'm not asking for a lot here. I lost a lot of XP before I finally discovered what the problem was by looking at logs and talking to other MP's. It can't be THAT hard to fix....it's not a major issue....probably nothing more than a typo in the code. Next patch maybe???? Or the one after??? Please???

hello,

i just take down server time to write a litle words about this exploit describe by cs.
i am not here to write how it work but i want to give my point of view about it.
it's not an exploit in my mind but a regular use of game mechanic and it useless after a certain level , up to 50.
why i say that ?

first point is ,
what cs can say about ppl that use stupid level 1 debuff to get rid of root or similar casting. In mission, something i got rooted by mob or slowed, so i use a poor level one debuf ( aimed shot or surch ) to break it ( in my mind this is an exploit ). what is the relation between the root and the aimed shot inexpertise ? try to find one and you will be lucky.
It's the same with all the mobs cast on yourself, just take one of your poor low level debuf and you can get rid of most of the most cast on you

second,
try to blind ppl that have turn an ao option off and you will see if blind works like it should be, same problem using e-traitement that normally should blind you for a certain time( this is an exploit too )

so before crying its an exploit, make a game without stupid bug

best regards

was level 4 with 3963/4000 xps
killed a monster and earnd the xp
was now level 5 with 41../4500 xps (didnt get ip though)
killed some more monsters and finally
was level 6 with 6 / 5000 xps

So basicly I just skipped my level 5 dohh !!  You can check my char imaka. Actually got 21 strength and agility.

I think you can easily check this one calculating ip spend ip remaining and compare it to the theorical level of ip I should have given my level

The Feet of Stone graft you were trying, was it high-level or low-level? The failure rate problem does seem to apply to the Sparrow Flight grafts as well...

Any more data-points on this would be *really* appreciated.

(Also reported by email.)

When being aggroed by some mobs, you will be warped to them. This is very annoying.

Hell, if they want to kill me, they have to run/fly after me!

Experienced this bug in my yalm too. Even though I was virtually in orbit, the mob warped me to the ground.

Kzak @ 9/19/2002 11:10:23 AM (52790):
Equal rights! We want nanos/items that can teleport the mobs to us, when we want to aggro -them-.

OK, so you are in a fight, your bot is fighting one mob another attacks you, you can see you are going to die if you stay, so you leg it outside, or to another zone. 

Then comes the bug, you try to join a team. But no, it says that you are in a fight!

This can be sorted by killing another mob, but it is still a pain.


I am guessing this bug only affects pet profs.

Slyyk @ 9/20/2002 8:45:58 AM (52942):
I noticed the same thing tonight. I had a runbuff giving me 734 runspeed and took a burst of speed stim and went down to 533. They have always worked fine before this.

Kzak @ 9/20/2002 10:52:45 AM (52843):
I've suffered from that bug before. You're no longer in a fight if you /terminate the bot, though.

But if you rely on buffs to get slayerdroids out, it's a bit of a bummer to have to go through that, if there's no Trader or MP nearby to renew Moch/wrangles.

Dynizmo @ 9/20/2002 1:15:17 PM (52843):
The problem is that when the bot follows you into another zone or if you die etc, the bot still is holding agro, which of course means you can't team. So u either terminate ur bot (and all the buffs on it ) or just hang around a while.

Destractor @ 9/20/2002 1:30:12 PM (52843):
As I said before, if you find a nice grey mob, and kill it with your bot, then you are fine.

Being asked to terminate my bot after the time and effort put into getting it (finding and paying an MP) would have been a real pain.


I just hope this gets fixed soon. Engies have a hard enough time getting pets and finding teams.

Divinecross @ 9/20/2002 3:36:39 PM (MA claws damage bugged 53165):
I fairly enjoy pvping as a doc I like know when I need heal my hp and what my exact hp is.  I had fight in camelot today with MA using a claw.   I have full hp at 6K nearly doing just fine then I get hit with dimach of 2.3K or something then I just fall over dead all my hp disappears.  I later find this due some lame bug with MA claws not showing damage in pvp.  This bug been around since they put MA claws in the game kinda wonder never been fixed.  Well just fair warning anyone pvp against an MA cause more likely just fall over dead from damage you never see.  This also happens in pvm btw.  If you ever teamed with claw MA you will notice that mobs will fall over with 1/2 their hp remaining.

Hypos @ 9/20/2002 4:37:25 PM (52942):

Thanks for the info.

RVWinkle @ 9/20/2002 8:04:33 PM (52843):

Calio @ 9/21/2002 6:42:02 AM (new bug warning when NPing: implants changing 53336):
This happened to me just a few hours ago. I reported it and sent in the screen shot of the chat confirmation of what happened.

I was doing QL200 (normal) implants for someone. I saved the right HAND for last because the shining inner fire cluster needed 1k NP skill and I had to find an MP for the boost to get over 1k.

I put the faded and bright in with no problem. When I put the shining inner fire in, the implant changed to a QL200 jobe right WRIST implant (not a refined implant - a jobe implant) and all the clusters had been changed. I forget exactly what the clusters had become, but one had become a health or nano delta cluster.

Fortunately, I had a spare empty 200 rt hand in the bank that I gave the guy along with the wrist, but he was out the clusters he had bought (though he now has a wrist implant that may be worth something).  I don't know if this is a consistent occurrence with 200 rt hands and shining inner fire clusters, or not. so just a word of warning.

Krabbus @ 9/21/2002 10:30:32 PM (New exploit 53457):
This exploit/bug is only working when you have some extra IP and too low base ability to raise a certain skill. If you open your skillwindow and try to raise a skill, but get a message that says your baseability is too low you can only raise the ability temporary. Then put your IP points into the skill that need higher ability, after that you can remove the IP points for the ability you raised. 

Not a big issue, but it's a bug after all... will I get banned for doing this for 2 levels?? I hate raising sense to be able to raise physinit... don't ban me please, I'm posting this after all... hehe... bored...

Now as its reloads and goes through its next cycle it will completely miss everytime and not display any messages. When the second cycle comes the bow will fire and complete a sucessful attack. Instead of having a 4s attack I end up getting an 8sec attack during reloads.

Also does this bow use ranged ini. or physic ini.?

Mercatura @ 9/22/2002 5:01:12 AM (53457):

this happens with every single weapon that uses ammo... it takes time to reload and it seems like you are missing all the time (animation keeps running). That KIWD crossbow is a ranged weapon (using rifle and bow as req) so it uses ranged init.

Hey i got a issue that i end up with alot of times...

Its while combine a cluster with a implant.
It dosnt work at all. u dont get a error msg or anything it just dosnt work combine em..

Today this happend again. We where making a ql200 Chest. Was trying to put in a ql195 Shinning Cluster of Life.
When i tried on my Agent i got a msg that i needed 1k NP. ofcoz.
So i tried the guild engie that have over 1k NP...
He said it didnt work...so i figure maybe we where buged in trade...so we both zoned and reloged but still same issue. Just didnt work to combine. So i called up on a MP with over 1k NP...Same thing there nothing happens no msg no nothing.
So i though lets try one more....So i called on a NT with 1kNP...
And guess what....Still same thing we just couldnt put the cluster in the implant.

Is this a known bug of some kind?
It isnt the first time it have happend to me.
Ofcoz i could just go buy a new cluster like i always do...
BUT...what about the ppl that spend alot of cash on ql200 cluster and implant and then later find out its bugged so u gotta get a new cluster....

I would like to get some kind of feedback on this.

Hi,

We were doing a ql193 team mission in BS as a full team, all went well, we killed all mobs then killed the boss to get the "100% mission completed" 

Then, the mission owner picked the item to get the 1.2 million rewards we diserved and then .... nothing .... no token, no xp even if it was 100% on mission completion.

I don't complain about the 1 million xp "not gained" but just be aware it can happen.

Thanks,

ps : we were not lagging and no one has zoned during mission

Hypos @ 9/23/2002 4:58:40 PM (53639):
Maybe the skill of the people involved were too high.

When doing trade skills, if your skill is higher than that required for the task at hand, the end product can raise in QL.  So, if you're making QL100 items and have a very high skill, you may end up with a QL105 end product.

There used to be a problem that occurred if your skill was high enough that the resulting item would be over QL200, then the end product would not be created, but your input items would still be deleted.  A long time ago, FunCom changed this so that the input items would no longer be deleted, but you still wouldn't get an end product.

From your description, it sounds like the bug has changed a little bit.

Drabin @ 9/23/2002 6:27:24 PM (53639):
Sorry, there is no such thing as your skill being too high.

With imps in and full skills, my nano programming topples 1100.

When making implants both the cluster and the implant MUST be in your regular inventory - not in a bag.  Secondly, you must have two empty spots left in your inventory when combining.  Thirdly, you combine the implant.  

If you receive an error then you know the problem.  If you do not receive any errors and the implant does not combine then you haven't placed them in the inventory like I showed nor do you have extra spots open.

Also, make sure they are the proper cluster type.  If you are supposed to combine a shining (cluster type) into an implant and you accidentally bought bright of that, then you can't combine it either.

This error is not a bug - its a user error.

Kuroshin @ 9/24/2002 12:43:46 AM (53639):
Not true Drabin...

I have had the same exact problem with two different implants.  One of which was an exact copy of an implant I was already wearing (just higher QL).

This is a bug.

Considering I had been making implants practically all day, I know how things have to be in order to assemble correctly.

It has nothing to do with how many inventory slots are free.  It has nothing to do with the skill required/too much skill.  And here's the real kicker:

I was assembling a right-wrist implant.  It was to have three clusters: Parrying, Nanite Resist, and Ambidexterity.  I could put the parrying cluster in, then the Nanite Resist cluster, but then I was unable to put in the Ambidexterity cluster.  I tried reversing the procedure - Ambidexterity first, Nanite second, then parrying...  At that point, the Parrying cluster wouldn't go in!

----------------------------------------------
EDIT:  Yes, I bought extra implants and clusters to test this
----------------------------------------------

It is well known that you can't put two clusters of the same type in one implant.  However, Parrying and Ambidexterity are *not* the same.  Not only are they not the same, but I had assembled that exact same implant pre-14.5 at a lower QL!

I have had the same problem with putting together a leg implant that held Agil, Stam, and Sprint...  I've made dozens of them over the past year of play, and now the Sprint cluster won't go in!

The only things I have found in common between these implants, is that the clusters I am having conflict are the shining and faded of the various types, *and* the faded clusters are all using the old graphic for the nano clusters.  Now, I don't believe something so stupid as a graphic could ever possibly cause them to not work properly - they should be linked in no real way to how the clusters work.  I'm just throwing out the common observations I have made.

So no, it is not our fault in any way.  It is a bug, and it's one that I have only seen since 14.5.  If you wish to give it a try, and see if you can succeed where I have not, I will gladly hand you the implant and cluster so you can try assembling them yourself.  However, be aware that *3* people have tried to create these implants for me when I found that I was unable to do so.

FC, fix this bug ASAP.  I can't finish a set of implants for one of my alts.

Kuroshin @ 9/24/2002 12:54:43 AM (53336):
Thanks for the heads-up. 

Your NP skill must have sent it over QL200...  Talk about a sloppy error in the DB.  Shouldn't the Jobe implants be flagged as something other than a normal implant?

locomdenom @ 9/24/2002 6:20:32 AM (53336):
There's another confirmed bug with NPing where QL170ish leg implants will randomly become QL201-202 Refined ear implants with NCU clusters installed when programmed.

happened to me too, my waist with faded agi & bright max health changed to a jobe leg implant; clusters changed too

Scoville @ 9/24/2002 8:40:43 AM (Token loss due to mis-click 53997):
This one's easy to avoid if you're halfway awake and alert, but us 3am players may find it annoying. 

Normally when you cash a token found as loot (or received as mission reward), you get multiple tokens based on your level. Example, at level 108 I get 5 tokens awarded.

But, if you (stupidly I grant) right-click a token while it's chest (or mob?) loot, instead of left-clicking to pick it up and then right-clicking it once it's in your inventory, you only get one token regardless of level.

sike @ 9/24/2002 9:04:32 AM (Aimed Shot secret nerf!!! 54002):
Right i am convinced that in the last patch, Aimed shot took a large and undeserved beating with a nerf stick.....

I am a 173 agent with a x3, 1243 AS skill, 1001 atk rating 950 rifle skill, maxxed stats all over the place. So you will agree that my aimed shot should be feared!!

NOT SO!

before patch aimed shot were mainly 

3.5k-7k... maybe 80/100
10k 10/100
1k  (min dmg) 10/100

since the patch it looks more like this ( please believe me, I did 7 missions today testing )

1k ( min dmg ) 85/100
3.5k 10/100
7k 4/100
10k 1/100!!!!!

in 7 missions 1..... yes one.... a lonely all by itself solitary singular not attached to any other number individual number one!!!!

PLease test this yourself and post your findings. I have spoken at lenght to an ark about this matter and he seemed completely disinterested and even blaise about the whole thing...

Lets get something done!

I know that this is not a bug per say, but it is (in many peoples opinions) broken game play.

Inocybe @ 9/24/2002 10:31:29 AM (53512):
The KIWD is a rifle/crossbow hybrid weapon and you need very high range init for this weapon to work well.  I would recommend the TIM scope for this - do not use regular vision enhancers or the old LLTS. This 4.xx/2.xx weapon is about damage-over-time and for that to work extremely well, you need massive range init to pull it off. 

Also, if you are missing a lot, it could mean that you have too low an attack rating for the QL you are wielding.  Try to implant all 3 rifle clusters for this weapon. If the KIWD is your main means of dealing damage, then max Long-Range implants and max High RoF implants are a must. Max Manual Markmanship implants are not really necessary but good if you can.

Krabbus @ 9/24/2002 11:47:37 AM (53997):
token found at mobs is Brave Token - you will only get 1 token for that... reward tokens is something else, that scale with your level (5 at 100-124, 6 at 125-149 etc)

This must be some kind of bugg It happens to me alot, but i just go buy a new cluster. If im lucky i get the implant done.
But when it comes to a shinning life cluster for ql200 imp it might be abit harder to find then if ur looking for a cluster for a ql90 imp

When doing trade skills, if your skill is higher than that required for the task at hand, the end product can raise in QL.  So, if you're making QL100 items and have a very high skill, you may end up with a QL105 end product.

There used to be a problem that occurred if your skill was high enough that the resulting item would be over QL200, then the end product would not be created, but your input items would still be deleted.  A long time ago, FunCom changed this so that the input items would no longer be deleted, but you still wouldn't get an end product.

From your description, it sounds like the bug has changed a little bit. 
			
		
	
The skills of these 3 ppl that tried making this implant was all diff. To high - Just right enough.
ql195 Cluster shinning ...should work kinda good with a ql200 implant. But you just cant combine em

Pepin @ 9/24/2002 12:58:10 PM (53639):
It happened to me with QL 50 & QL 70 implants - there was this *one* cluster who wouldn't go in the right implant, and I didn't get any error msgs. Tried zoning, logging = no result.

I was lucky it was the first clustr I was trying to implant in each particular implant, because I continued with the other clusters (worked fine), and then I found out I could insert the other non-functioning clusters...

So, IMO, I had to change the status of the implant to be able to insert the cluster. Hope that helps.

Wraithverge @ 9/24/2002 2:22:17 PM (MP summoned weapons steal kills? 54052):
anyone else had this happen?  the monster dies because of the poison caused by either the crotalus (crotchless damnit!  it's an atrox staff!) viper staff, or something of that like, and you dont get the kill.

I'm not talking about the usual damage, but the DOT that they cast every once in a while.  I've know about this bug since they first released these weapons and have posted it numerous times to the gm's/arks.  I first noticed it hunting offal larvae in agean, when weapons came out, shortly after I stopped playing my MP.  Restarted again, and noticed it in a missions when the token % chance didn't go up.  kiled everything and was sitting at 96% token chance.  Now it happens about once ever other missions, for that to be a 4% no exp/token, then it's a 2%exp loss, anyone wanna give MP's a 2% exp item in a hud slot that only works while soloing?  (comeon what are the odds that 20 points of damage is gonna kill a mob in a team?)

Darn! Happened to me again at the "The One" mob. 

Flying high above the ground in my yalm. Auto-attack disabled. Suddenly, warped to the ground and smacked by The One and his guards.

Is this some kind of "fix" to the issue of mobs jumping into the sky trying catch you when they aggro??   Hope not!

I also have tried selling items, the also remain at the same price.

wolven @ 9/24/2002 5:40:04 PM (Broken Implant Combinations -- LIST HERE 54093):
Lets make it easy on the dev team.

If you find an implant that 1: doesnt combine that should 2: Combines, but gives an unexpected item, or 3: doesnt uncombined and should... post it here.

This way, the devs have 1 spot to look, and can tweak the items that need it:-).

Make sure to include 1: the implant, ql, any already installed clusters or mods... 2: the cluster you tried to install, and 3: the result.

Nivenyrral @ 9/24/2002 8:41:03 PM (54093):
OK, here are my results with legs:

QL200 Leg with Bright Evade and Faded Life.  Creates a QL202 Ear implant with 3 clusters installed.

So far the creation of a QL200 Leg with those clusters is the only combo that produced another item.  All other QL Legs I have tried with bright Evade and Faded Life clusters have failed to combine the second cluster, no matter what order they are assembled in.

As a workaround for those who must have that evade and life cluster, if you install the life, then a shining nimbleness, the evade goes in normally, and you get a good implant.

Kuroshin @ 9/24/2002 9:32:31 PM (54093):
QL70 Right-Wrist implant using the following clusters:

Shining Parrying
Bright Nanite Resist
Faded Ambidexterity

Parrying and Nanite Resist will go in, but then Abidexterity won't.  Conversely, Nanite Resist and Ambidexterity will go in, but then Parrying won't.

QL50, 70, and 90 Leg implant using the following clusters:

Shining Nimbleness
Bright Endurance
Faded Sprinting

Nimbleness and Endurance will go in, but then Sprinting won't.  Conversely, Sprinting and Endurance will go in, but then Nimbleness then won't.

That's all I've found so far.  It seems like some clusters are conflicting since 14.5 that never used to.  Also, it never under any condition gives any kind of error message.

EDIT:

Nivenyrral, that's some messed up stuff, right there....

Kuroshin @ 9/24/2002 9:38:05 PM (52790):
Had the same thing happen in team missions...

Really annoying, as a non-combat Engie to be warped to the boss mob, even if it doesn't smack me around immediately after (thank god bots hold aggro better than they used to!).

Not sure if this is a bug, or something special that certain mobs can do.  If it is something special, *PLEASE* look into reducing the range on that ability!!!

EDIT:

Damn typos.....

Kuroshin @ 9/24/2002 9:40:48 PM (54052):
It also happens occasionally with normal DoTs, mobs that get killed while rooted, and mobs that are killed by pets during times of high latency.

Really friggin' annoying.

We will not ban people for owning two of the same Unique item. I would suggest you do not wear / wield two of the same Unique item though.
			
		
	

i was told that same exact thing from an ARK.. word for word. i guess it must be what your suppose to say so you dont get in trouble, just in case.

First time i've used NS since the patch and whammo - got clobbered by bileswarms despite NS being up.

Thought it might have been due to lag damage ... so i tried it again.

Sure enough.  NS was up and still taking FULL damage from one boss mob only (have a screenshot).  Petitioned and they said they'd look into it.

Has this happened to any other NTs?

Hibernation @ 9/25/2002 8:26:31 AM (54245):
Yes some bossmobs hits right through NS, if this is intended or not i dont know.

However i think its intended and that its gonna stay that way.

Hibernation @ 9/25/2002 8:34:12 AM (52790):
Yes and its even more fun for crats that gets their charms broken at an instant if they get warped by mobs or zone out of the bossroom.

Imagine i charm two boss-minions but the boss decides to hit me when im low on Hp i zone out from the bossroom the minions follow me down but gets free from my charm once down.

Voila they finish of the last hps i got.

I have to do /pet free first to release them, then i can go down.

Kzak @ 9/25/2002 9:56:16 AM (52790):
It seems a little overpowered that warp, for the outdoor bosses, should reach across the entire zone. Range-nerf them! They shouldn't have a range greater than 40 meters, same as us.

Maybe he just copy / pasted what I said. That way the ARK is always safe, as he/she can blame me.

Anarchin @ 9/25/2002 10:54:08 AM (52790):
I can't believe this warping ability of some mobs is intended. If it was

- it would be listed in the patch notes
- there would be some way to resist it (evade/dodge)
- it most likely would be some kind of nano program executed on you

None of the above applies. 

A bug it is!

blech 

also i have lost items in trade bugs
i am also wondering if that has been fixed 
losing a real good item/rare is very frustrating
we don't get reimbursted so i just hope this has been fixed 
i'm sure many would appreciate this fix as many i know/known has have lost a item this way i even know a few who have quit due to this trade bug so please get this fixed asap or if it has been fixed i thank you but you are also a tad too late

I use Roger Wilco to play with a few friends, and since 14.5 it seems as if the health bars when actually targeting the player are not functioning properly.

I'll get shouts over Wilco like "Heal me! I'm at less than half health!" and it will look, to me at least, from looking at the targeted player's heath bar that they are nearly full.

Mercatura @ 9/26/2002 9:58:56 AM (54005):
I check a certain batch of names every few weeks or so. Some I actually know the people who had them parked, and they are loooooooooong gone. 6 months+ after cancellation for sure.

Whats funny is I park some decent names myself...catch22, its hard to find good names (at least ones that are spelled correctly) so you park the few you can get for later.

Frankly, if a char is under level 10 (or whatever) and hasn't been logged into for 3 months...delete it or rename it to inactive0001. It would force people who still play to log in their mules 4 times a year, BFD. Or spend half an hour to pull them above whatever level limit.

If I attempt to unequip again then I get a cannot perform this action while polymorphed (or something similar).  This has been going on for many patches now but seems to be worse in 14.5.0.

Bug: Weapons constructing is very messed up

A lot of weapons constructions don't work.
It's very annoying that almost 50% of the weapons can't be constructed due to bugs in the process somewhere.

Also the fact that a lot of manuals contain errors don't help.

It came to my attention that these problems are known to you for a period of time. But nowhere can a warning be found that the items I buy for construction is a waste of money and time!

Even worse... when I petitioned an ARK about it why I couldn't get the weapon together, he was mostly focusing on what I could have been doing wrong instead of telling me that you have big problems with a lot of bugged weapon construction processes!

1) Please make the users known what doesn't work so we don't spend our hard earned money on it.
2) Fix all the weapon construction processes
3) Remove all errors from the manuals
4) Keep the ARK better informed so they can tell a petitioning player immediately what is going on (actually this shouldn't have to be because of step 1 to 3).

Bugs-Requests: Several other small bugs and requests together

* Make it possible to name bags. This helps keeping them from each other in the bank for instance

* Make it possible to drag an item from the bank and put it in the chat bar. It's very annoying I have to take an item from the bank, and then be able to show it to others.

* Fix the Health bar problem in the team window when zoning

* Some level rooms have items that gets monsters and pets stuck behind. Please change those rooms to not have NPC's stuck anymore.

* Make the spam barrier for messages a bit larger. I'm getting pretty annoyed that I have to wait for 5 seconds after each 5 items I post (like from boss loot for instance)

* Make a solution to fix the large number of missend tells.
I've even seen GM's send mistells, which should say enough that it's not working properly. My suggestion... Separate chat windows for each private person you chat with.

* Instruction discs: tell in the info window, which profession the nano crystal it produces is for.

* Help tips... the first time a new player gets a trade skill item from somewhere, there should be a tip explaining that trade skill items are partial items to a construction of something, so that they can't use that item directly for something.

* Lifts: change how the lifts work... A small button to be clicked upon is a terrible system especially since it can be removed from sight by players and monsters standing over it.

* (Boss) loot droppings: If you shift click a monster remains, you get a list of all the loot it dropped. Same for chests (after opened).

Luckily for me these were ql20 imps and clusters and not something higher and more expensive.  This is a real problem.  I can see how this can get very ugly for alot of ppl.  I hope they fix it real soon.

I will edit my post with the cluster names after I log in, but the problem seemed to be the ql20 head implant.

Codewitch @ 9/27/2002 8:48:10 AM (IP rounding Errors? 54770):
This happens fairly often, and I usually just try to ignore it rather than /petiton because I have heard an ARK state before that there are "IP Rounding Errors", wherein an IP point may not exist because the IPs "round up" and show you as having one extra IP when you don't. 

What happens is that I only put exactly the amount of IP I need in firstaid/treatment to use a certain ql kit/pack, then go hunting, then I can't use the kit/pack cause it says I am 1 IP short.

Well, recently, I have been showing as having up to 3 IP short after having just set them???

After nearly getting killed several times by not having enough IP to use my first aid, I now always leave extra IP every level specifically to raise these 2 skills as needed due to this "bug".

Here is my question, why does the IP  "round up"?  Why is it not just whole IP points?   And how IP expensive will this get at higher levels?  This happens on all my characters.  Is this an IP visual error-bug, clientside?  I thought they fixed that.

None of the above applies.

Actually it was mentioned in the (i think) 14.4 patch notes. So it's not a bug.

No. Nothing in the 14.4 patch notes.

I still claim it's a bug.

Mercatura @ 9/27/2002 9:10:19 PM (54093):
If you find a combination that returns a ql200-205 Ear imp with shining ncu and faded psymod, let me know 

When they fix this, it would be nice if they could go and change pharmatech for the build requirement of the jobe imps. When we said we wanted to do more with tradeskills, we meant more things to do. Not do the same things a different way.

I hope making dodge/evade/life legs aren't messed up. Thats real common for people after breed caps.

Mercatura @ 9/27/2002 9:14:41 PM (54770):
When I full IPRed (with 0 spent in mapnav) at lev 134, I was 91 IP short.

Worst case would probably (hopefully) be a couple hundred IP by 200.

Dyna18 @ 9/28/2002 12:46:15 AM (This game has a story? 54966):
Well I know it has, with the book, 4 animated movies, timeline and newsitems etc.

But if I would never look at AO's website and only know what is shown and told in game, I would pretty much know nothing about the story except it's clan against OT.

But even when people take interest in the story, they are hardly given information about what's going on.

I've read the introduction stories, I looked at the 4 animated movies and followed the whole time line. The only thing I haven't done is read the book. But even with all this information I hardly have an understanding of the things going on.

So why is the story not integrated in the game?
Why is it so hard for the gamers to find out what's going on with Rubi-Ka.

For instance let me ask a few questions and see how many people know the answer to them.

1) The pyramid is obviously an important building for Rubi-Ka, it's been referenced to in several places including shown in the animated series. Why is this pyramid important for Rubi-Ka?

2) In the NE of Rubi-Ka the omni tek mines are heavily populated and guarded by cyborgs. What were the events that lead to this take over?

3) Where did the ship with the first person to set foot on Rubi-Ka land?

4) Why is the MP Neleb upset with Omni Tek?

I doubt there are many gamers able to answer these questions.
Which proves my point that the story is not integrated and not made easily available to gamers in-game.

So please start doing that, tell the story more actively then just make changes to the world now and then!

Some side points:
- The animated series are just an introduction for me, why are the events told in them never further shown?
- Why isn't the timeline updated anymore since Feb?
- Above questions are not just random examples but actually questions I would like to know the answer to.
- I play on RK2

Dyna18 @ 9/28/2002 12:54:31 AM (Events on RK2? 54968):
I joined the RK2 server exactly at the first of this month.
Now almost 1 month later I have not seen even 1 event taking place!

I always follow the Harrold Broadcast channel and I even log it.
I've played this game this month for 14 days 5 hours 40 min and 23 secs. And not 1 message was send over this channel.

I've also kept my ears open for other means that events would have been broadcasted, but I haven't heard of 1.

Furthermore I regularly check the event calendar on the website.

The only event I have heard about this month was just today. And it was afterwards when I was in some idle chat with some friends.

So it comes to this:
* Why aren't events held regularly on RK2?
* Why aren't events properly announced in advance so people can participate?
* Why isn't the broadcast channel used?

I must say that I'm really disappointed in this. I definitely expected more interaction with the story when I bought this game... Not just doing missions and leveling without any idea of the bigger things going on

It's not just the boos mobs that can warp you back. Today I was warped back four times by one of The One's minions, I was in my Yalm and just wanted to take a peek at them.
I feel sorry for people who accidentally aggro's a boss and gets smacked, must be extremely annoying.

Chalk up yet another questionable design decision for Funcom...

Phunked @ 9/28/2002 11:20:21 AM (54530):
I just experienced this same exact problem.

Cept it is constantly that way. My Yalm icon is constantly shaded. I can load it up......go to unload and im still in it till I zone. The polymorph message....same thing. 

I just got my yalm bout a week ago and havent had a problem till tonight. 

Although before it happened, I was parked about 15 meters above a boss camp. They couldnt reach me, so i went AFK before i dropped down and attacked. When i came back i was at the reclaim. Boss had killed me....although i thought i was well outta range. (Yea I know....stupid  ) Then noticed the Yalm problem.

Are there any "dying in yalm" things I should be aware of?

There was an ongoing event on RK2 - the whole Intercessor thing, which just up and stopped one day out of nowhere.. Intercessor just quit logging on or something.  I think Quickstart is still around, and has a price on my head, but the hell if he's going to pull that off since I quit

Karanya @ 9/28/2002 11:46:02 AM (54968):
Oh, and in my experience on RK2 most events are announced via the faction leaders channels, not the "event channels" like the Omni Herald Broadcast.  Which means org leaders hear about the events and pass to their org, which sucks alot since it excludes people who are not in orgs, or if their org leader isn't online.

Cayana @ 9/28/2002 9:05:07 PM (Implant disassembly kit bug 55122):
I spent an hour or two gathering together the right QL parts to make one of the new implant disassembly clinics, for stripping the clusters out of implants.  Then I was looking at it, and a portable surgery clinic in my inventory, and I wondered what would happen if you tried to use it on somebody like a surgery clinic.  So I targetted my friend and right-clicked on the implant disassembly clinic and it vanished.  

*weeps for her lost implant disassembly clinic*

Cayana @ 9/28/2002 9:35:58 PM (45820):
I don't think walking is related to runspeed at all.  If you get run debuffed, even for like -2000 runspeed, you can still walk at your normal speed.

Balcrush @ 9/29/2002 9:05:40 AM (HP bar bug + still-in-fight bug 55224):
I know this probably is the most posted issue here on the bug boards, but I will still post the issue up, so that the those dev's
maybe one day realize how important this is, and actually tries to
fix it 

I am a doc, and this bug is REALLY affecting my gameplay
when I am in a team, and f.ex actually fighting the boss.

Somebody suddently /shouts me that I should heal.
Okay, it didn't look like that, he was by my team bar allmost at
full health.
And, okay, I save him, but it keeps happening.
I know some ppl will just say "Nah, just type all buttons F2 thru F6 fast, and it wont be no problem", well, I'd really call that a handicap for a doc  ..
Next time, I will have two guys /shouting they both need heal, okay team heal coming up, done, they are full hp again, or....?

But the worst part is when I scream that I need nano, we all go down for a sec, for me to refuel my nano, but wtf!! I am in fight, this totally screws up my healing abilities!
And this is, secondly, when the tank, who stayed up there for 10sec's, comes down realy hurt to like 100hp and a DoT on him, but I don't have any nano to heal him cuz I am loading nano atm only thru nano first aid, and that takes a while!!

I thought this bug would be fixed by 14.5, and I really looked forward to it, so plz, help the doc's do what they are supposed to do; healing

Gotta say, though...stuff like this:

Tritoshe @ 9/30/2002 7:05:13 AM (Fix mission crash => player death when relog!!! 55410):
Hi,
This is not the first time, it has already been mentioned as a problem. It seems that is has never been addressed still! This problem is quite simple, it is not a bug, but the consequence of a bug/crash. The changes to be done here looks MINIMAL to me.
The problem is the following:
Yesterday was in team mission, in Avalon. Everything was fine until, after 1-1,5 hour we all get stucked at the button room on the first floor, after clearing the complete level: nothing worked except chat!!! Impossible to sit down, to go out... As a result, logout/login.... AND THE VERY BAD SURPRISE to login in a mission that has been RESETED! Of course, although it took 5 sec for me to die, and loose 1-1,5 of team work.
But why this problem is still there?
There is a simple way of solving this!!! When a situation liek this occurs, the player SHOULD NOT REAPPEAR in the middle of the mission, but at the door or better, in the FIRST ROOM!

Please fix this!!!

This is incredible to see how small issues, small bugs are not adressed correctly in this game. A few efforts on some parts and it could be <easily> so much improved!

Any ql right hand implant with:

Shining Weapon Knowledge
Bright E=MC^2
Faded Bursting

Will turn into a same ql Jobe-made Leg Implant with

Bright Radiation Reflection
Faded Stamina


This happened at ql50, then later with ql90 and ql125... total of about 400k credits down the drain.

If you take out the shining Weapon Knowledge, the imp goes together just fine.

Meurgen @ 9/30/2002 4:54:52 PM (52625):

Hypos @ 9/30/2002 5:03:20 PM (54968):
Yep, I've never heard anything over the omni herald channel.  Like Karanya said, you can only hear about events by word of mouth after they've already started.  It makes it impossible to follow the story line they created to chain some of these events together.

Pluteaux @ 9/30/2002 9:05:26 PM (54093):
My QL 30 Head implant with a Bright Weapon Knowledge cluster already installed won't except a QL 27 Shining Computer Skill cluster. I get no message at all. It just won't combine.

I have more than enough np, and the implant and cluster are both in my main backpack. Had just successfully added Comp Lit clusters to Eye and Right Hand implants. Tried zoning, putting implant and cluster in the bank and taking them back out, and putting them on the ground and picking them back up. Nothing seems to work.

...Bought another QL 30 Head implant and was able to add the QL 27 Shining Computer Skill cluster. I'll hold onto the bugged QL 30 Head implant with a Bright Weapon Knowledge cluster in case anyone wants to take a look at it.

...I was able to add a Shining Chemistry cluster to the implant with the Bright Weapon Knowledge cluster (Chemistry was required for the last step in the creation of my new Electron-Charged Pistol).

Mercatura @ 10/1/2002 6:23:34 AM (54093):
Shining Small Arms Right Wrist (bright/faded empty) + Bright Akimbo Style = nothing happens

However, if I added a Faded Gunslinging first, it would then let me add the bright akimbo.

This is not a bad one, generally anyone that wants pistol & multiranged here would probably implant flingshot too. Even if they don't, it doesn't change the ability requirement (agility) and faded are real cheap

After dying it appears the Treatment and Time+Space skills, possibly along with others that I have not tested, do not work until their value has been restored to way above the required level.  I have not noticed this before 14.5.1.  So thats another bug they have added while fixing others.  It may be small but their code must be so fragile if things like this can be effected by their actions.  Little things like this that don't go unoticed but they really start to detract from the game when more and more of them start appearing.

I was self-buffed with the +20 gen. expertise buff, and it was doing a fair amount of dmg. The crits were at a pleasant 1200-something points.

The next day was patch day (2.nd october) and I just gave some leets a few shots, but I couldn't understand the poor damage it was doing. The crits are now at 900-something!

So, from one day to another the crit on a ql 111 Schuyler Bow was reduced with 300-something points!
Why is that? It isn't mentioned in any patch notes. Am I the only one experiencing this??

Hope that anyone can turn on the light somewhere.

Thumble @ 10/4/2002 11:55:31 AM (54712):
I have had many questions on the fitting of claws from within the Red Tigers, here is a formula that I suggest to our members whne asked, which always gives you the 2 attacks:

Take your unbuffed MA skill, add 46 to it and fit a claw that meets the total MA skill: Do not  buff Kali and fit a claw because you will be OE'ing the claw on MA skill. - Yes it will be ok, but you will be gimped once Kali dies.

It seems that the amount of MA skill needed for the claw to dual attack has to be relatively close to your true unbuffed MA skill, and obviously if you buff Kali and the buff dies so does your chance of dual hitting:

For some reason you just can't follow normal weapon fitting rules with this type of MA based weapon.

I look at it this way, your getting 14 more hits anyway so there is no need to risk pushing the claw into this MA OE.

Thumble @ 10/4/2002 12:05:04 PM (53165):
Sadly this is true: If I am using claw you don't see my claw damage :-/  pvp, or pvm

This is (or was) also the same with parry sticks: I once got accused of being a gimp (lol) by a team member because all they could see was the fist damage I was doing when I had a Parry stick on :-/ 

It was a shame that the person declined my pvp offer, my 20 parry stick hits a minute cracked skulls pretty well (at least in my client view)  

But it's one to watch for, for sure, as it can catch you out, and that goes for us MA's too

Thumble @ 10/4/2002 12:27:52 PM (Icons keep moving, moving, moving 56538):
I used to be able to ignore this rather tiresome [B]Bug[B], but I recnetly started a trader Alt and with all the nano programs she has, it has become unbareable.  

You log in, some of your Program Icons have moved.  Some to different tabs, some just in the location (usually ending at the top) of the group you have put them in.

So you spend 2 mins (up to 5 with the trader) rearranging them to how you like to have them. Then go about your business, eventually (usually due to sleep deprivation or starvation  ) you log. When you come on again, lo-and-behold, your Icons have been sleepwalking and are in other locations again.   

How the hell can this be I ask? Isn't this all written to a file on your local drive? that stores the location of the programs?, as you set out your gui how you want it?

I can't belive that such a bug (And it has been going on for a LONG LONG LONG LONG time! ) is still present in the AO client :-/

How hard can it be to track where these program icons are placed, and KEEP them there? Please sort this tiresome annoyance out FC!

Skyhigh @ 10/5/2002 5:40:58 AM (Pet pathing, maybe the problem is elsewhere.... 56750):
Maybe the problem is in buggy dungeon layout.  The pet thinks that your somewhere else, in another room.  

You might have notice that too, getting in certain room corner and your pet who was following you all of the sudden start running in the opposite direction.    Just like the pet thinks that you leaved that room and are into another.    

I've done a test with my pet, you know that large room with a big rectangular table....   Have your pet follow you, go in walk mode to be sure he's in your back all the time.   Then slowly back up in a corner.   As soon as you hit that corner, the pet all the sudden start running the opposite way, immediatly get out of the corner and the pet come back to you.   It's not all rooms, but some make your pet go nuts when you hit a buggy corner.    

Same thing happen with certain monster, sometime a monster is in the far corner of a room and you can't attack him or select him.   I strongly believe that some rooms are bugged.   You think that a monster is in front of you, but for the game it's somewhere else, in a another room.

Pet pathing might be more related to bad dungeon layout.  Try to follow someone when all of the sudden that person who was 2 feet in front of you warp into another room, then 2 sec later he's back at is previous position.

Syryx @ 10/5/2002 6:50:53 AM (54530):
if your yalm is greyed out, try placing it in your bankbox, then to your inv again. that will fix it.

Also, if you die, then equip yalm as soon as you have the vehicle air sufficiently out of rez shock, but are not yet fully out of rez, you will always stay 'stuck' in it when you unequip.
To solve that, wait till you're fully rezzed before equipping yalm again.

And if you are as tiny as a lilliputter when you unequip yalm, just run out of targetting range from whoever you appear tiny to, this will 'reset' the graphs.  This also applies when you appear invisible to others in a teammission.

hope that helps at least a little bit ^^

aguiapower @ 10/5/2002 8:27:49 PM (about team missions and solo them 56862):
Hello there. This is my first post and i will try keep it clean.

I was teamming up with 4 regular friends and was waiting for the 5 member. In the meanwhile i get one team mission to solo it latter on, and all my friends receive it.  I say to delete it..because is to make it latter on. What is my admiration when one team member says that what im doing is considered exploit and shouldnt make this. I could get banned for doing this(and probably can), but several points i need to show.

1- I didnt know! ...(i asked in the guild and no one know and no one believe in me)
2- If its considered an exploit then should be a problem to solve
(autodelete the mission if in 5m the char isnt in team)
3- What is the problem if i make a lower mission that my lvl.I will get lower things.

4 and last to Cz. If exploits and banners are so serious shouldnt be a stick threat at the begining of this forum with all the things that can result in banned?

its has been a pleasure. And no i dont wanna get banned nor i will keep making team ones solo for now.

skybert @ 10/6/2002 4:25:33 PM (56862):
I can honestly not see soloing teammissions as an exploit.

Really.

If you can convince people to team with you, so you can solo it, fine. Go ahead IMHO.

SlyHunter @ 10/6/2002 6:11:44 PM (Lesser hold person 57020):

Totally aggree with that, often caused by pets users, should be fixed -note also the can't join team, in a fight bug, caused by pets again-

Then what good is rooting.  I want to hit him in a distance while he's stuck far far away with his piddly little melee wpn.

ntrox1 @ 10/8/2002 2:49:22 PM (56538):
Bump.  My MP has 2 nano icons in the programs group that keep moving to their default locations.  I always need to move these to the PSI group, as I use that as a combat bar of sorts.  Very annoying when I can't find NSD or CoC!

ntrox1 @ 10/8/2002 2:50:51 PM (54530):
Same issues here with my alts.  Also, try sitting then equipping your yalm.  You can only move at run speed on the ground, and cannot fly.  Pointless really.

Slyyk @ 10/8/2002 4:51:37 PM (52355):
Same thing has happened to me several times now. Only thing is, sometimes I don't even get the damage messages. I'll be standing there nuking one target in tandem with the attack pet while the Mezz pet is doing it's thing on the other. All of a sudden, BAM, I'm dead with no warning. It mostly happens if the healpet is not on you. If the healpet is on me I sometimes drop all the way to zero health (again no warning) then shoot back up to about 3/4. If the healpet isn't on me, I might see a string of damage messages, panic and get the healpet on me, and then get healed almost as quickly as the damage was done.

I was in a team with a guildmate last night while the mez pet was on one mob and we were attacking another. All of a sudden I get hit for 70, 169, 71, and then I'm dead ( I have close to 2k HP at level 41 and was full health). My teammate says "wtf, you only got hit three times?".

It seems to be a sync issue or an error in the code somewhere. The opposite has happened sometimes when I play my Fixer. I hit q and burst and an entire string of messages of the damage I will do to the mob for the entire fight will scroll by. Then I just stand there and hope I don't die while the mob continues to fight with no health left for about 5 minutes. Either way, I've lost over 70k experience points in the last 3 days due to these mysterious damage issues.

Animosity @ 10/8/2002 5:01:49 PM (52355):
Because of this and other issues, I never use the mez pet in team situations. Sometimes I bring him out if I am a team with a heavy damage dooer, because we can often kill the MOB before the damage delay stops.

Phrexia @ 10/8/2002 5:07:18 PM (52355):
Sounds like you may also be experiencing lag. And luck, since for most it seems that the heal pet cannot heal fast enough to keep them alive when the mezz bug strikes.
I've simply been warning every MP I see using one about the problem. None of the people in my guild use them, since we are all aware of the problem.
It just annoys me that Funcom doesn't at least post a warning about these things, or better yet, remove them from the game until they work.

Sihirbaz @ 10/8/2002 6:02:08 PM (943):
The well know calm bug:
Cast calm on a mob, which didn't aggro anyone yet => if the calm itself doesn't aggro mob, the calm will be shown as successfull, but the mob is only rooted not calmed.
Should be: If it's rooted, than it must be calmed.


The not-so-well-know-one:
If you attack a calmed mob with a DD-nano and you fumble the cast, than the calm breaks, but the rootpart of the nano doesn't.
Should be: If I fumble a cast (I haven't even used nano for that fumbled DD), than neither calm nor root should break.

Gridguardian @ 10/8/2002 7:57:27 PM (57020):
Rooting is a good use to run from fight, change aggro or used to KITing, when you root, back off shoot root backoff shoot root

REBOOT

Crashes almost randomly. Seems to happen when IM zoning. If I dont click on yes, then I can reload the game and continue playing. Clicking on yes = reboot.

Click Saver

  Click Saver isnt your problem, however it does crash my system any time I use it. 

  I would like to see an in game version of click saver and nano nanny. These are great tools, and used by tons of people. Putting these simple apps in game would greatly increase playability. I know you have heard this a thousand times, so this is 1001

Slyyk @ 10/8/2002 9:52:29 PM (52355):
I've also noticed a slight workaround to this problem. When a mob gets mezzed and the little halo disapears, if the mob continues to not move you move to a diferrent room. This apparently forces the mob to react and chase you without getting the phantom damage. 

Also, putting the mez and attack pet on one mob. If the mob stops moving and doesn't attack either pet for about 3 seconds you need to nuke/debuff/run/whatever. A moving mob is a controllable mob. Basically, if my something-seems-a-bit-odd-all-of-a-sudden-o-meter goes off I leave the room.

Xanthir @ 10/8/2002 10:57:54 PM (53798):
There are a lot of guns where they use melee init instead of ranged.  Two adventurer pistols, the bbi faithful and the hsr explorer, both use melee init instead of ranged.  If the fact of having a useless ranged init of 300 isn't bad enough, because these weapons use melee skills, they get parried all the time (proved this by using Kaen-Archibald Kolts and the BBI's).  It would be nice if these item problems concerning initiatives were fixed.  I don't like wasting ip pts on a skill where its not even viable due to a bug.

Snuble @ 10/9/2002 8:24:57 AM (56862):
Nope, I've got problems to see that as an exploit. 

Just remember that it can be annoying to receive team solo missions while your waiting for the team to assemble. Nothing is more annoying then starting a team, and having a pickup toon go silent and never show up when you got a full team. (This is where repeated abuse probably can get you a harrasment warning)

But to ask politely when team is splitting, and perphaps make them stay for a minute or two while you get missions to solo, no problem.

Snuble @ 10/9/2002 8:38:38 AM (XP bug in team missions 57716):
XP bug in team missions:

Your team splits taking down several mobs. Now, if your kill two mobs at about the same time, you will first get the xxx can loot, and no XP, then when you complete your own kill, you will get XP for the other mob and your own.

Now, if your team split in three... You will never get XP from the first kill, only the second and the third. Sometimes not even from the second... Something is bugged here, and this description of the bug should ring a few bells at FC

Vyker @ 10/9/2002 8:54:16 PM (What to do when you cancel a trade w/ full inv 57868):
First DO NOT panic.

*breath*

Second tell the person that you were trading with NOT to move (not that it's really important that they don't walk around but you must trade with them immediately)

Next, clear out space in your inventory.

Last Open a trade with them again and wait about 30seconds... so far 100% of the time the items just popped back in and was able to decline out with the items falling into the new found space I created.

Just make sure that neither of you start a trade with anyone else before you do this.  Not sure if the items will poof completely or just hang out.  May test this tonight to verify what happens then.

**edit because my spelling sucked badly today =)

Vyker @ 10/9/2002 9:56:50 PM (54530):
Actually it's a bug with you having an air nav skill that is equal to the yalm.

Raise it a couple points over and it goes away.

this does not apply to the you flew into a mision in the yalm died, and are standing at the reclaim with a greyed out yalm.  just wait till you finish rezzing equip and de-equip the yalm and all is good then.

kylee @ 10/11/2002 5:56:37 AM (Item "Poof" Bug 58267):
I lost my Dragon Circlet today because of this bug, and I was able to reproduce it and poofed 6 more helmets... I'm not sure if it works with other slots.

How to poof your items:

Make sure your helmet is in a backpack (havent tested it in normal inventory).  Right click it repeatedly, itll give you an "equip" bar thatll spam over and over.  If your timing is right, the item will equip and you'll right click once more (if your reaction time sucks like me) on the empty space.  The helm will appear on your head, but upon that last click, it will disappear.  

Zoning won't fix it, rearranging items wont fix it, having a free slot in your inventory wont fix it either.

My petition is in on this... I'm guessing I wont get any help on it, however. 

edit: this was done in my apartment, but not sure if that has anything to do with it.

Sparkyd @ 10/11/2002 7:04:44 AM (Droprate of Decranum's MK II Armour 58274):
Cz, I'm not sure if you'll get to this.  I'm making a plea here.  Can you please pass onto the devs to take a look at the droprate of MK II armour in Smuggler's Den?

I have been camping the Smuggler's there for almost 2 months now, hoping that I might finally be able to finish my set and get my sleeves.  

I haven't seen sleeves drop even once so far.   I'm not complaining that it should drop from every kill in the Den.  Of course the point of this armour is it's NODROP and UNIQUE, etc. and it shouldn't become common/over-used.

However, after spending another 5 hours today at SD and having NOTHING to show for it...I'm starting to get a little aggravated.  One chest piece dropped (for team member) and a Boot dropped, but before we could loot it, body mysteriously vanished.... 

All I'm asking is the Dev's take a look at the loot table.  I'm asking that all of the pieces drop evenly and more uniformly.  I'm not asking for a ridiculous increase in droprate or anything like that.  All I'm asking is for something a little less aggravating.  

Thanks.

To anyone else, please don't flame or unnecessarily criticize this post, I posted this out of genuine frustration, not unnecessary (imo) whining...

why do you have a bunch of characters that you don't play who are all below lvl 5? I know I wouldn't care if they deleted one of the worthless characters I never intend to play again... 3 months is a long time to not touch a character.. I log in almost all my characters at least within every 3-4 weeks.

I know exactly how frustrating this is. Having put alot of time aquiring an item for your character only to have it disapear from some stupid bug. I have had this happen to me before with items of less importance, but when items of such value to a character vanish I think they have to do more to help. Even if it takes some time. Items that come from quests, special NPC drops and all items that don't drop anymore should be replaced imho. Don't give up on this, you should have your Prof Jones Vest back!

Daschle @ 10/11/2002 7:33:52 PM (54005):
Not likely to happen... 

Think about it.  How many of us canceled shortly after retail due to massively excessive suckage?  I did, as did several other friends.

Nine months later, I have returned.  And it is good.

My chars were sitting there waiting for me.  This pleases me.


How many people would come back if they knew their chars would all have been deleted?  Less, I suspect.


Thus said, I agree that it's REALLY frustrating to try and pick a name.  Just look at the names of my chars, some of them are awfully stupid.  Best I could come up with, given the absurdly restrictive naming filter.


I would vote in favor of purging any char under level 5 on canceled accounts over six months.    


I would very much vote in favor of deleting all chars on perma-banned accounts.  It's sheer stupidity to not do this.  On the other hand, how would you feel if you're a new player running around getting tells from people accusing you of being one of the biggest exploiters/hackers in the game ever?  People refusing to trade or group with you, etc.  You'd be a little confused, and perhaps disallusioned with the game.


The simple solution is to open up spacing in names.  Let me name myself "Wen Ho lee" instead "Wenholee" and stuff.  The char server and clients would have to be modified to accept quotation marks or something, but it would free up a very large bank of available names, I'd think.

I step inside to find Funrniture (this is ok, it is a specialty shop), but I find a COMPUTER TERMINAL that sells Low level CRUD you can find in any BASIC STORE.  And instead of changing the QL to match the Level of the store or removing this terminal to place the TRADER term in its place, you rework and leave?

Said this before Ill restate:

BIOMECH ARMOR  this was reworked sometime back,  now everyone who wears gets the TreatMent / FirstAide Boost.   

Last line in DESCRIPTION:  'enhances the medical skills of a Doctor'

I try and Equip an ITEM from inside of a Bag.  Instead of telling me something like 'You cannot use this from inside a bag' it says 'This item requires a Computer DECK'

NanoRegen Kits / Treatment LAbs / First Aide Stims....you increased the drop rate of these in mission loot table for chests.  Problem is that they DONT STACK with eachother   and We still cant stack STORE BOUGHT nanoKits or TREATMENT labs.

This is just a question:  I remember once carrying 10000 bullets and being so slow do to encumberance that I had to drop a bunch of them.  There is still a like in the STATS area for Weight Limit,  Is this no longer used?

New content is nice  dont get me wrong, but can you put a few people on a crew to FIX things that are already wrong in game?

Those same shops carry Yalms.  I would hate the thought that they would be restricted to match the level of the store.  But, maybe when I get to 200, I'll have the IP to fly around in a QL 200 yalm.  I guess I can dream.

My recollection is that encumbrance was pretty bugged (i.e., taking one thing out of a bag and placing it in your main inventory would render you virtually unable to move until you zoned/logged out).  My guess is that they determined that just getting rid of weight altogether was an expeditious way to solve what was evidently somewhat of a thorny issue.  All I can say is that I'm pretty happy with that decision, compared to what it was like having to empty and reload bags and/or zone every time I did something with my inventory.

Greybear @ 10/11/2002 8:22:19 PM (58428):
No one said RESTRICTED,  the Computer TERM should be the lvl of the STORE   ie ADVANCED or SUPERIOR   cause if your buying a YALM u dont need a ql6 NCU.

My point is that I've purchased a number of Yalms in these shops.  All the ones I've bought are in the QL 30's range.  I've even camped shops to wait for them to pop in that QL.

But, I guess what you are saying is that you'd like *some* booths to be in the appropriate QL, but others not?

hey Seth good news
I got all of them back
lucky me. It's just like other people said
the DB was messed up
basically, I reinstalled and repatched AO then everything's gone back to normal. =)

sly310 @ 10/12/2002 5:13:43 AM (Destination: Tir?! 58522):
I noticed this a while ago... when they put the new whompa system in. In NLC, there was a whompa to Tir, and they changed it to go to Newland Desert. The whompa path was changed, the sign above it was changed, but guess what? If you shift left click the door, it reads: "Destination: Tir"... lol... very good FC 

Some newbie might be getting lagged, and doesn't want to look up, so he/she/it just shift-left clicks the whompa to see where he/she/it is going... uh oh... instead of the beautiful city of Tir... he'll be sent to ol' cabbage crotch himself, Stolt Jensenburg!

Greybear @ 10/12/2002 5:36:32 AM (58428):
Guess u can say that but ql30 is the ql of some items you would find in an AdVanced Shop.  Ql30 Implant Blanks   Ql30 TreatmentLabs

What Im saying about the Specialty Shops is there is nothing Special about the ComputerTerm, its a BASIC TOOLS term in any  BASIC STORE, so get it out of there or atleast increase the ql 

Also: O.E.T. Co. Vegetable Urban Sniper (its a pistol)

It boosts:
Melee. Init. 30
Ranged Init. 30

Hmm, I might have missed something somewhere. 

Also the Map Upgrade for Machines,  sure is nice it shows me the Store Terms inside the store or in areas but why doesnt it show me the GRID POINT or Mission TERMs, or BANKS?

Why does 2Ho have so much REALESTATE and when they added the other whompa awhile back they just didnt go ahead and move it further out to , I dont know, STOP CROWDING the area?

2Ho has two RECLAIM pads and Terms   where is the INSURANCE TERMINAL?

Actually, Ive been having a problem like this for the past two days.  Today I shut down AO in disgust.

I play MP..only lvl 8...but Im fighting in a mission...two pets attacking with me...and Im going along fine. Health seems to be good from looking at the bar 47/106, and then all of a sudden BAM Im dead and the health bar immediatly goes right down to zero.

This was happening alot yesterday and a few times today before, like I said, I logged off in disgust.  It dident even look like I was getting hit.

skybert @ 10/12/2002 12:32:42 PM (54005):
Ok. Everyone has room for 8 chars on their account, right?
Now, one person may not be able to, or willing to play all eight chars all the time. And some alts has been made for roleplaying purposes only. They may be even more active than any of you, even if they don't lvl up. leveling up isn't the only sign of that char beeing played.

I bet the right lvl 5 char has way more time under /played than, let's say, a lvl 150 char.

Just because you don't powerlvl, doesn't mean you're not using that character.

So, NO! Don't delete chars to free up names. That would severely kill a big part of the roleplaying community IMHO.

...and what's wrong with beeing innovative with names?
If you're out of ideas, spend 5 minutes on the net, typing 'random name generator' into a search engine. I typed that into www.google.com, and ended up with numerous of places with name suggestions/generators.

I'll give you one example:http://rinkworks.com/namegen/. Lots more where that one came from.

First of all, it is effectively just a simply hassle to make me log in every char every so oftern so as they don't get deleted.  It doesn't change anything.  So that right there is enough of a reason not to do it - it is effectively inneffectual.

Second, why can't YOU delete those characters you never intend on playing again?  You too lazy or something?  You're basically saying that FC can determine my interntions (or, well, yours at least).  Well they can't!  But I can determine my own intentions.  And if I am not sure, then forcing the simple act of merely logging them in every so often is, again, inneffectual.  A series of actions with no meaning other than to go through them every so often.  May as well not have them at all.

Cheers,

Inyuendo @ 10/12/2002 4:43:45 PM (Clicking on Request Mission button fails sometimes 58611):
I don't know if this has been reported before, so here goes.

What happens is that when I am at a mission terminal and find a mission that I want to go to, I click the Accept Mission button. Some of the time, the game fails to place the mission icon/key in my inventory, *even if I do not already have 3 missions*. 

(For some reason, this seems to happen most often with missions whose reward is an item that I really, really want -- coincidence? =)

There are no set of circumstances that seem to precipitate this occurrence, at least, not that I have been able to detect. I have a nagging su****ion that it may be somehow tied to my current frame rate which seems to affect the response time of GUI elements being clicked. (I.e., the lower my FPS, the more sluggish the response time). 

I have spoken to an ARK about this, all he said was that (paraphrasing) "I may be desynchronized from the server". He didn't offer a way to resolve the issue.

I would appreciate some insight into how to resolve this problem, because for me it is one the most annoying and frustrating bugs in the game.

Inyuendo @ 10/12/2002 5:34:31 PM (Remains of monsters disappear on terrain/in walls 58623):
Just as the title says:

After killing a monster on terrain that is quite hilly, or sometimes after killing a monster (usually waste collectors) in a mission, the remains of the monster will either sink below ground level or will end up inside a wall. This results in the remains being unlootable.

Does this happen often? No. But it's there, and smacks of a certain lack of polish, or "we're not-quite-out-of-beta-yet". Please fix this, as it's one of the first bugs a starting character will see happen.

Inyuendo @ 10/12/2002 5:41:31 PM (Items that can't be traded from container (yet) 58628):
I frequently get this message when attempting to sell items at trade terminals. It's not a major bug, because all that needs doing is to move the item to the main inventory window.

Nonetheless, it's there, it shows lack of polish, and it should be fixed.

Harammer @ 10/12/2002 6:51:07 PM (Low Quality Arwen MO-404 Grenade Launcher broken? 58651):
I decided to twink a new Engie that I created with the  Low Quality Arwen MO-404 Grenade Launcher that I could buy in the trader speciality stores. It seemed like a good idea at the time.

Then I noticed my grenades were being parried. Is this gun broken and using the wrong inits, like the BBI Faithfuls?

It seems that every gun in the trader store is broken and using the wrong inits. The BBI Faithfuls, the grenade launchers, and the Bio-Collin's Rifle do not work properly. Let's get this fixed!

The reload time on this gun is abysmal as well. I notice there are many times I will spend the entire battle reloading and never fire a shot!

I have to manually reload this gun between shots to get any effect out of it. If I let the game manage the reloading, I get about one shot off during a battle. If I manually reload it, I can do 3. What gives?

Oh yeah, if I let the game manage the loading of the gun, I'll often get aggro when the game displays the "reloading" message. That seems a bit flaky to me as well.

Inyuendo @ 10/12/2002 7:28:16 PM (Strange fall damage bugs 58663):
Bug 1:

I have observed that when standing on the edge of certain structures, I will take continuous fall damage without actually falling off the structure if I am standing on one of the extreme edges of that structure. In other words, I can stand on a building, move right next to the edge, and start taking fall damage *without actually falling off*. The damage continues to occur as long as I stay on the edge.

The effect of taking fall damage more than once can also be observed when walking (not running) off the edge of a structure.

Bug 2:

I have noticed that when moving over rugged terrain, I will occasionally take fall damage during laggy conditions. For example, if at time "t0" I was on top of a hill and at time "t1" I am in a different location and 50 feet lower than at time "t0", the game appears to make a calculation based on how much my vertical coordinate changed during the time elapsed between t0 and t1, *not how it changed*. In other words, my perception of events was that at time "t0" I was on a hill top and at time "t1" I was someplace else, 50 feet lower, but I simply ran there without falling off a cliff; the server, however, because of lag (I'm guessing) thinks that I must have fallen, and so slaps me with some bogus fall damage. So far, this has not been too serious, but it is one of those things that makes me go, "WTF?"

Harammer @ 10/13/2002 7:56:41 AM (Missions in inacessible parts of the map 58774):
Tonight I was doing the living cyber armor quest for a lower level alt, and was on the gloves. Was given a mission to find someone in Newland Desert.

Go to the desert, follow the direction arrow to go to the mission. I end up in Newland. Go back and try again. Same thing. Look on my map of the zone, and the mission is just beyond the zone boundaries, and is between the two zones.

Delete the mission. Exact same spot. Try again. Exact same spot. Finally, I have a GM warp me to the mission so I can complete it. What a pain. Finally did get the gloves though.

Necrofiliak @ 10/13/2002 10:16:28 AM (boosted graft bug 58786):
u right click on it and it doesnt execute, yet u get the graft acts liek it did cast and so the 30 min recast lock gets used. very annoying bug.

Bionitrous @ 10/13/2002 11:20:44 AM (58786):
That's by design.  The very lowest level boosted grafts have a 40% chance to fail, while the quality level 200 versions only have a 10% chance to fail.  In either case, using the item locks the skill no matter what.  

We could ask for a 'fizzle' message, however to reinforce the idea that the hacked item malfunctioned.  Unhacked grafts never fail as I recall.

Jaarin @ 10/13/2002 3:47:36 PM (58774):
I ran into the same bug, in the newland /zone border area.  I had a GM teleport me to the mission area only to find it broken anyways.

cro @ 10/13/2002 4:44:51 PM (commander brock ring quest 58838):
I ran into this the other day. 

Being missing from AO for a long time, returning to try out these missions is nice. However during an earlier mission I collected two "recruit dogtags" from OT mobs. When I undertook the Ring quest (first ring) i was allowed to put the two "recruit dogtags" into the"grunt bag" and then give the bag to Commander Brock. Net result? I lost two recruit dog tags *and* the bag and had to delete the mission.

cro @ 10/13/2002 4:48:58 PM (teleporting mobs 58840):
I honestly thought this had been fixed a few patches back, but when I was out hunting for some rookie dogtags, i got aggroed by a blubbag at a higher level than me. 

So doing the logical thing with my ultra-high (for my level) run speed (plus run buffs) - headed for the hills, watching my health go down and the blubbag's radar dot getting further and further away. (as an aside, I also had a rookie OT guy chasing me).

Then, suddenly, both mobs teleported through a hill I'd just run over (according to the radar they were on the other side of it) and kept attacking me. 

So despite having a much higher run speed and *RUNNING AWAY NOT ATTACKING* they teleported after me and I died.

Remember: I WAS RUNNING AWAY NOT ATTACKING. I really really really REALLY wish you could turn of auto-attack - i don;t like it, never have and have broken many an ESC key trying to NOT attack a mob.

So i guess this wasn't fixed after all, nor was the "attack a player over an unrealistic distance" bug.

Mercatura @ 10/13/2002 5:30:17 PM (54005):
Out of all the level 5 chars that havent leveled in 8 months or whatever, maybe 1 in 100 is on an active account.

They don't have to level them.
They don't have to keep them logged in.

They wouldn't have to get deleted, just renamed to inactive#### or something.

60 people have to spend 3 minutes to log in maybe 1-3 chars for 30 seconds IF they want to continue to park those names, and 6000 names are freed up.

Small price, big dividend.

And of course, some level 3 idiot NT has my name.  

I'll bet you $50 that this person hasn't played the game in a long, long time.  Or, even more likely, that this account is canceled and inactive.

It really sucks that all the good names are taken by people who gobbled them up and then canceled.  I don't blame the people, I blame Funcom...


A name-reclaiming process needs to be implemented.  With all the people who canceled after retail, there's simply no excuse to let all the good names sit and go to waste.


I agree with the Renamed##### thing.  That's by far the best method.


Please Funcom, throw us a bone here.

Samad @ 10/14/2002 7:19:03 PM (Blitzing headaches 59148):
For the past couple of days I have been blitzing missions non-stop. Trying to save up for a yalm. I start in Rome Blue and roll missions until I have 3 "find object" missions to Trade District. The missions are QL25 missions, same level as my character (alt). Always checking to make sure the mission really was accepted (see posts regarding disappearing missions).

Here is a list of problems I see after playing for 3 or 4 hours.

Most of the time, when I find the item and go to pick it up, I have to disengage from combat by hitting the Q key or right clicking on the combat control on the control bar. My Def -Agg bar is all the way to Def. When there aren't very many mobs, this works perfectly fine. The problems start occuring when I have 10 - 15 mobs "chasing" after me. I find the item, go to pick it up and it won't let me, I look at the control bar and notice that it shows I am not in combat. I try and target a mob, believing that the control is displaying the wrong information because of the number of times I have been shot, and I am unable to target a mob. It states "Please wait for previous action to complete". Now after hitting the Q key about 15-20 times in a state of near panic, the control finally changes to show I am in combat, now I can disengage and pick up the item. Most of the time, a few times I have had to run around in the mission for 30 seconds or so until the control shows I am in combat. This is not my idea of fun. Waiting in a crowded room with 10 - 15 things wanting to kill you and you can't target anything or disengage from combat to pick up the item and get the heck out of there. The fun only gets better after that.

After picking up the item, I start my run through the mission to make it back to the mission entrance and safety. Wrong! I usually run into a room and notice that instead of doors, I now see black squares that I can not run through. I can see the other side. It looks like all the doors are open, but all the lights are out in the rooms beyond. Regardless, I can not run through them. Now sometimes, the door I just ran through still looks like a door and I can back track and hope I find another way out, but this doesn't happen very often. Most times I am stuck in a room with four black squares that used to be doors and no way to leave. The mobs can't get in either, which would be great if they couldn't shoot me or nuke me through the walls, but we already know about this bug, don't we.

After logging out of AO, and then gathering up the desire to play once again, it is getting tougher all the time, the problem usually disappears for another couple of hours.

LittleHorror @ 10/14/2002 7:22:23 PM (58628):
Most of the time those items are from item pickup missions that give that message.

Well that is when i get those messages

Greybear @ 10/14/2002 8:13:25 PM (58428):
Why is it I dont ever see a line:
'Skilled Clan TRADER has Fumbled'?

Why is it that NPCs can cast a program and get 2 attacks right after it or even sometimes during it?

Why is it that some NPCs get a CRIT every shot?

Maybe it is just me, but have you ever died to:
'You have been hit for 137 points of damage'
No attacker   no damage type and its not just 1 line  its several about 1 second or 2 seconds apart.

Aggelikki @ 10/15/2002 3:44:46 AM (59148):
You can turn off auto-attack so that you don't need to disengage from battle every time.  From your description, it seems that you're having a laggy connection.

Greybear @ 10/15/2002 6:47:35 AM (58663):
I have seen the second version you talk about.  Its an odd one alright.



Something odd about Fall damage Ive also noted.  Its more for the same fall based on a higher level.

I base this on the instances in the TRADE room in Stores.  Id check the upper levels and then just jump off the railing to get to the floor.   The lower lvl I was the less Damage I would take.

Yes, uncheck the Auto attack monster under Misc in Options.
Before that option became availible you could slide the aggbar to def (slightly below middle was enough I think) to get the auto attack turned off. That is disabled now and you will attack anyway.

1. When you notice the first black door, go back the way you came and let the door to the room you want to enter close before you try to enter again.
2. Lower your speed a little if you're faster than you need to be.
3. Stay cool.

Neither of these things will fix the real problem, but it will make blitzing a bit easier for you.

Vigar @ 10/15/2002 4:48:44 PM (Screen Appearance 59402):
Im not sure whether Im having a problem.  However, many items on the screen (not other characters typically, but buildings, structures, bridges, and other environmental objects (but not doors)) do not appear on my screen except when viewed from certain angles.  For example, I can see a door, but no building around it.  Is this the design of the game.  I had assumed that this was the case, but then after browsing the screenshots and noting that my screen looks substantially different from the screen shots, I began to wonder.   Please note that I have windows ME and a cable connection to the net, so I don't think my computer or my connection should be the problem.  Are there video cards necessary for game play -?  Driver upgrades?  My documentation for the game does not mention any of this and I cannot tell from looking at this site.  Thanks.

Some of the items include Support Beams, SOL Fire Executioners, implants with the new graphics, and more... there are far too many for me to remember... the key thing the items seem to have in common is when they were introduced in the game. I.e., some of the recently introduced items can't be traded from container (yet).

This doesn't just happen at trade terminals either... it also happens when trying to place items in the Trade Window with other players.

For the past 30 - 40 levels I have been using Zenith Taichi's having opted for the MA Engineer route. 

After reading the forums I have noticed several people commenting on the possibility of there being a bug using the Zenith Taichi's. Here are my observations: 

As I said Ive been using Zenith Taichi's for the last 30 levels at varying qaulities and I have noticed a common trend. I only get a problem when my weapon is over-quipped. 

Now I know when a weapon is OE it is so many % effect, but that shouldn't stop the MA attack all together, it should mearly make it however many % effective. 

When it is over-equipped I do not use my MA skill at all, and can't hit for any MA damage as well as the 1h-edged ( Zenith ), I only hit for 1h-edged damage. 

When the sword is 100% then I do both MA damage and 1h-edged. 

This theory has been tested at various levels of my characters life, and using various QL Taichi's, and always seems to be the same. 

Over-Equipped - only 1h-edged damage.
100% - Effective 1h-edged and MA damage.

My advice would be to make sure your weapon is always 100% effective until Funcom have addressed this problem. 

Can other people please feed back on this, let me know your findings... I would like to see these swords working properly, they aren't common in game, yet they are VERY good weapons, and would be made even better if this bug could be fixed.

Kzak @ 10/16/2002 11:54:20 AM (59656):
This probably has little do to with OEing weapons, but which Zenith Taichi are you using? The standard ones or the Improved version?

I used to Improve weapons, but sadly they weren't nearly the gold-mine of credits I had hoped they would be..

Isgrimnur @ 10/16/2002 12:19:09 PM (NPC mobs and Parrying 59693):
I notice A LOT of NPC mobs parry WAY too much.

Ranged NPC mobs parry, um is that possible? Thought they would need to use melee to do that? Kinda sucks to have a Vet agent parry your dimach.

Just think this is a bug that needs to be addressed. If this is posted somewhere and my tired, blind eyes didnt see it, sorry Cz.

iguanoid @ 10/16/2002 12:25:23 PM (Mob shields reflect damage while reloading 59694):
Has anyone else noticed this?  I solo my low level alts a lot of the time and i have noticed the following.  When i am attacking a mob which has a reflect shield, the shield reflects damage from my attack, even when my attack is a reload attack.  Ie when i dont shoot but reload my gun, the damage shield on the mob still hits me back, even though i am not hitting the mob

Yesterday I was having a problem (well, up until yesterday) with the appearance of my screen, and very kindly, several of you responded rapidly with some help.  I had email the bug to FC as well, and they got back to me with a graphics driver to install, prettty quickly.  However, now that  I have installed the driver, Im unable to log into AO, and keep getting error messages as follows:

DDERR - INVALIDPIXELFORMAT

and then

RUNTIME ERROR 
C/Program..../AOnline/CLIENTR.EXE
requested to terminate in an unusual way.  

Needless to say, its a little frustrating, because I just equipped some new armor and implants, and well, you get the idea.  

Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks.

Greybear @ 10/16/2002 8:37:06 PM (58428):
Maybe youve seen this:

'Please wait'

look familiar?  It seems way to common for me, as a DOC trying to use a healprog during a battle. Hadnt seen this before last patch, except maybe back during the SparklingFreedomArms3927 problems, but that was a long time ago and to fix a SUPPOSED EXPLOIT.  Guess Docs are exploiting their HealProgs now.  That would be a crying shame, I can see it now:

'FunCom fix the Docs, During PvP they can Heal.  Fix them Now or Im Quitting.  Whaa  whaaa  whaaa.  Fix the Doc Heals so they cant use them, its an EXPLOIT.'

Oh the horror. 



Not sure about anyone else but when Im taking on a Boss Camp and the underlings, I press a Prog,  I get an Executing line and a Execution Bar but once its full I get nothing and Bar stays.  Ive gotten upto 5 Incompleted progs with bars on the screen at one time during these battles.  I also lose Nanos during this,  to get them to cast I have to recast and reuse Nanos.  This is a time consuming and Nano Costly problem.  
It has something specifically to do with the Boss MoB.  No affliction progs are being cast on me by him, its something aparently in the coding(My opinion, and its not worth much)

Ill add to this. Since I began camping Smugglers Den at 125 and now at 170, I have definately noticed a decrease in drop rate on MKII as more and more patches have been introduced. 

I personally have a full set, but I know how frustrating it can be to complete that set. I am now going to go through the whole infuriatingly drawn out process again with my Engie. 

The last 2 times Ive been down there with Guildmates we had 2 items drop in 5 hours. Same applies to MKI, which although rare, appears to be more common than MKI. 

Any chance the dev's. could take a look at this loot table ?

Samad @ 10/17/2002 4:22:39 PM (59148):
An update if anyone cares.

Turning off the auto target monsters works wonders. Boy do I feel like a n00b.

The doors turning into black squares is still a major problem. Looks like the client and server get way out of sync. When I was stuck in one of these rooms last night, I had mobs hitting me with ranged and melee, even though I could see none of them in the room. Fortunately, I have the highest possible HoTs I could squeeze into (using implants and various expertise nanos).

After about 30 seconds, all of the mobs that were attacking me warped into the room. At that time the doors also went back to normal and I was able to exit.

2 million credits in 3 levels! Not even level 27 yet. I'm feeling positive about getting my yalm by the time I am level 30

For the black door, how about sticking yourself to the wall(you've 4 walls to choose) or hide behind some obstables(if there're any)?
Maybe you can avoid the hits in some way.  Since you'll blitz lots of missions, you may like to try them out.  Don't blame me if you die.

Old bug.

Pretty sure I remember seeing it appear when other people could no longer pick your stuff off the ground. ("you don't own this item")

It gets even weirder, its not even consistient with the same items. I have a coat that gives the message and another coat (slightly different ql, but both over 100) that doesn't. Go figure  Pretty sure they're both primus.

Using different bags or locations inside bags doesn't change it. Seems to be linked to the item.

Black doors are very annoying... Its never a real problem unless there suddenly is 4 black doors... Then you are in trouble...

Samad @ 10/18/2002 3:30:29 PM (59148):
Thanks Mimi,

I have tried to hide against the walls and if there are any obstacles I have tried that also, no matter where I am at in the room, I get hit. I guess I will just have to live with the fact that sometimes I get hit with this particular bug.

Really not that concerned about it as long as I have both HoTs going and I keep my first aid up to par. I've been able to stand still and take the hits without any cause for concern. Except when I was getting hit for energy damage (that hurt) but, I fixed that by changing the armor I wear.

Vydas @ 10/18/2002 3:31:03 PM (58628):
I'm with the previous two posters that it depends on how the item originally got into any player's inventory.  I've only seen it in the case of pickup items (even if the original pickerupper wasn't myself).

skybert @ 10/19/2002 8:16:37 AM (58628):
Items you pick up in missions are strange. Allways have been.

A long time ago, I got three backpacks from a chest. None of them could be used. But I could place them in other backpacks....

There is something strange about mission items.

Vydas @ 10/19/2002 10:29:54 AM (58628):
I remember those backpacks, and had several missions with them.  At the time, though, I liked them (even though they were definitely bugged), because I was so poor, and they sold for decent prices.

Inyuendo @ 10/19/2002 8:21:34 PM (Weird bug while Yalm'ed in Omni Ent Arena 60667):
I was in my Yalm and decided to pop into the arena to watch some fights up close. After a few minutes, some trader tried to kill me (he cast ransack on me and took a few pot shots), so I flew out of range. After a minute or two, the trader left the arena. I flew back down, watched some more fights, and decided to leave (by this time, the ransack effects had worn off). I right-clicked on the arena exit, but I discovered that I couldn't leave. I unequipped the yalm, but the game wouldn't let me change back to normal shape. I was constrained to logging off and back on to correct the problem.

Inyuendo @ 10/19/2002 8:35:30 PM (Bug after fighting NPC trader in a mission 60671):
I was in a mission, fought an NPC trader (can't remember if it was a Rookie Trader or Novice Nanoshifter -- mission was around QL 60). Anyway, near the end of the fight, I of course get Ransack Skills (Major) or something similar cast on me... Being low on nano energy, I sat down and tried to use a nano recharger. D'oh! Time&Space skill too low. So I cast T&S Expertise on myself to raise it enough to be able to use the recharger. D'oh! T&S still too low. Sigh. So I decided to wait the 3 minutes necessary for the Ransack to end. Once it was gone, I tried to use the recharger again. D'oh! T&S still too low. I pressed 'U' to examine my skills, only to discover that all my my nano skills were fine (normal), except for the T&S skill (much lower than normal -- not colored red though)! Logging off and back on corrected the problem.

Not sure what happened since this is the first time I saw this occur, but I am guessing that if you cast an expertise while ransacked and then the ransack wears off, the corresponding skill doesn't reset back to normal.

Greybear @ 10/20/2002 3:58:23 AM (58428):
Well as some have pointed out:

Why is it if I just missed the NPC, do I get hit by its damage SHIELD?

Your gonna say because I got close enough to hitting them that the shield hit me.


So why is it when I hit an NPC without a Damage shield, they double over or stumble, give off the Ummff sound as if hit, and it returns a message that I missed?

Greybear @ 10/20/2002 4:03:00 AM (60667):
Being attacked, and that you only flew out of range and all.  You have to hit the ESC button like three times, sometimes before u can exit a vehicle.  

Just guessing.  I know it happens like this with my Kodiak (car).

>> Why is it that some NPCs get a CRIT every shot? 

Well, if you're fighting NPC traders for example, and you're getting crit'ed a lot, might be because your duck-exp evade is too low (since that's what shotguns use, and NPC traders use shotguns).

>> Why is it that NPCs can cast a program and get 2 attacks right after it or even sometimes during it?

I noticed this one too... on the note of NPCs casting, I wonder why it becomes increasingly difficult to interrupt an NPCs casting (I play an MA, levels 1-30 it was trivial to interrupt a green MOB's casting). After level 60, interrupting green MOBs is an extremely rare occurrence, even if I hit them for 4 or 5 times during their casting; haven't even seen it happen on yellows or higher since level 30 or thereabouts.

ChancetoFumble Modifier (Lvl*2) If Double Lvl then chance is 80% or if NT chance it 95%
ChancetobeInterupted Modifier (Hmm who knows) if Health is low and casting is a heal 100%





You might be right on the DUCK  just seems stupid to me that a Skilled Clan Sharpshooter in one room Crits me everytime, where as in the next room 1 out or 2 or 3 times and in the Next room same QL mob again 1 out of 10 times. 

But then wouldnt that make the Description for DUCK-EXP wrong?

-The Duck skill is the one used to determine if you are hit by a thrown weapon. But also your chance to aviod high explosives.

Tiggy @ 10/20/2002 2:44:49 PM (Black Doors in missions, still 60848):
All these new mods are just a waste of time till the ridiculous server syinc problem in missions is sorted out.

Many other on-line games need a far better character location systems than anarchy requires, eg 1st person shooters where it is essential that person x knows where target y is in order to shoot at them and hit, Eg quake, unreal, BF1942 etc etc. None of these games seem to have problems keeping track of 50+ players simultaniously. AO doesn’t need this level of sophistication as we only have to select our target and hit the go button and the server does all the rest. 

When you suddenly change velocity in a mission, ie go from sneak to run and then all the doors turn black and you get killed, things become very frustrating.

It seems the AO client is arguing with the server as to where your character actually is. This is stupid. Either the client tells the server where the character is (and forces an update) or the server should tell the client where the character is (and force an update). Either way there wouldn’t be this stupid black door bug that is an automatic death warrant to a character.

Perhaps part of the problem is the doors themselves. If you notice when you move through the mission how the little pink door dots unfold in front of you and disappear behind you, my guess is that the server doesn’t put in doors unless it has to so when you “slip out of syinc” you are in a place where doors haven yet been put into your map (or have been culled).  Despite what I have been told by the arks this is NOT a VISUAL BUG. It is a design flaw. It has nothing to do with graphics issues. 

Surly this bug is easy enough to fix, it’s not like it used to happen 4-5 patches ago. It is a problem that has been introduced into the game with some changes to missions. That being the case this “feature” could be undone.

It has to be more important to fix this issue than to keep rolling out new stuff, after all doing missions constitutes the vast majority of players time in the AO world, so logically the missions should be the most polished system in the game. Unfortunately despite 3 patches this is still not the case.

Kill this problem NOW.

Eurus @ 10/20/2002 5:28:52 PM (60848):
Actually it's a very old problem. Most likely your character wasn't fast enough to cause it in the past. Ask any of the old Fixers. Or an Enforcer who's stacked Fixers run buffs with Rage to blitz missions. It's not a new bug, it's been around. The key is to catch it as soon as it happens and instantly begin to backtrack. You may still die if blitzing, but if it's happening under other circumstances then you should be ok. Just because you've noticed a problem recently doesn't mean it's a recent problem.

Why do mobs get fat when you kill them? These are mobs, not hot dogs. They aren't supposed to plump when you kill them.

This isn't a bug, but an annoyance. Some of the death animations of certain types of mobs are just too darn long. Certain types hit the floor and you can loot them, others throw a William Schatner-esque fit on the ground before you can loot them. Seriously, tell the mobs to stop overacting and let me loot them already. lol

GM Hadrulf(I think this was the spelling) gave me the bag back, they have logs of this stuff... (Pretty neat eh?)

Anyway, I think my problem was that I was wearing the ring so remember to take the ring off, and to check that you have the mission icon in the mission window. If you accidentally deleted the mission just ask to get the mission again.

Happy hunting....

Drusillus @ 10/21/2002 1:00:32 AM (Links Armor Gloves 60979):
There seems to be a bug with Links Energized Armor gloves.  In their description, under the armor types it boosts, Cold AC is listed twice, whereas it should be adding equal amounts to Cold and Fire AC, like the other pieces.  And it does in fact add the Cold AC twice, and adds nothing to Fire AC.

Tiggy @ 10/21/2002 1:49:33 AM (60848):
It’s not that old. I have been playing for just over a year and it certainly never existed before 13.2 having chatted with the people who were high lvl (120+) when I joined the game they all agree that it is no more than a few months old.

The problem is it can’t be caught if you change velocity in a mission. If you are an agent sneaking; the second you are spotted you immediately start to run. If you can’t reach the exit in 5-7 seconds you are shafted. It doesn’t matter how much you back track or what you do. The likelihood is you are dead.

The only real clue you get to the likelihood of it occurring is when you first enter the mission, if you immediately set of at sneak pace and you get magically transported back to the starting room you know you are potentially going to have problems. Sometimes this transportation bug takes 10+ seconds to happen ie you have cleared the main room and are entering one of the far doors.

IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED

Verant: '  (wind blows, crickets chirp, dogs howl)  '


heheh  heheh  Anyone else remember this?

Some bugs are important, some are just annoyances, and so are absolutely funny.  Gotta figure which one is more important and which ones you can just let go.  Its functioning, not as intended, but works still.

This isn't a bug, but an annoyance. Some of the death animations of certain types of mobs are just too darn long. Certain types hit the floor and you can loot them, others throw a William Schatner-esque fit on the ground before you can loot them. Seriously, tell the mobs to stop overacting and let me loot them already. lol 
			
		
	
Haha, so true!

I've had this happen with various debuffs (MP debuffs, trader debuffs, doc init debuffs).  In my case, zoning (which is essentially what you did by logging) has always fixed it, but you are right, this needs to be repaired.

O'Rourke @ 10/21/2002 1:58:53 PM (Yalms and invert mouse control 61106):
I posted this elsewhere looking for help, but it qualifies as a bug so I'll post it here, too.

I spent my whole game-life savings on a Yalm this weekend, and was shocked to discover that that up and down are reversed for me - ie the critical "invert mouse" option doesn't work when you're in a Yalm.  

I've used invert mouse control in this and every other game I've ever played since the mouse was invented.  Having to make the awkward control transition every time I equip and unequip the Yalm is totally confusing and may, in time, break my brain.  It's taken much of the joy out of having the Yalm.

I can't believe this would take much effort to fix, so please do so.  In fact, I can't imagine why it hasn't already been addressed.

iguanoid @ 10/21/2002 3:45:02 PM (59694):
please fix this FC

Inyuendo @ 10/21/2002 5:06:24 PM (60972):
I noticed that in missions -- and this may occur outside of missions -- that for certain humanoid MOBs, namely, those of the Atrox or female breeds, the death animations are waaayyy to long. I get the "You can loot these remains..." message maybe 2-4 seconds before I can actually loot the corpse.

Believe it or not, I think I know what 'causes' this. It has to do with what damage type the MOB suffered during the fight. If there was any fire, chemical, radiation or disease dmg done to the MOB, the MOB plays a different (longer duration) death animation. Doesn't seem to matter if the last shot was not one of those damage types either.

I also noticed that under these circumstances, after the animation finally stops playing, the model 'pops' a little bit, in the sense that it shifts position slightly in the horizontal plane (usually 0.5 - 1 meters) from where it looked like it was originally going to fall.

I repeat, the problem occurs only with Atrox or female breed humanoid models after they suffered fire, chemical, radiation or disease dmg during the fight.

Ted @ 10/21/2002 8:37:26 PM (38880):
OK, glad I found this thread, because this happened to me once and I thought I had just accidental clicked the wrong thing. Now that is see this

BUMP - Fix please?

Majikall @ 10/21/2002 9:50:32 PM (58840):
What you're looking for is in Options - Misc, right at the bottom of the list.

But please Funcom, please fix this thing. I want my run speed to make a difference please, thank you. I'm an adventurer so have been putting points into run speed as often as I could, its green after all, now I'm flying along in Wailing Wastes and get attacked by a bunch of red con hyena beasts. I'm in bird form so I have 390 run speed, I have auto attack off so I don't get into a fight, so I keep rushing off. I outpace them, I think great, I'm safe. Then suddenly all 6 of them warp onto me and start attacking again. I escape, same thing happens again, until I finally die.

What is wrong with running from a fight? Actually, whats wrong with running from a mob, turning and shooting it, then running some more? They called it kiting in EverQuest. If you can outpace a mob, then you should be able to do just that. Its a good way for hunters to work, shoot an arrow/bullet into something then run for safety before firing a few more shots.

Please fix this, before I end up resetting my run speed points.

Alezka @ 10/21/2002 10:39:00 PM (Cant heal after death unless... 61249):
One thing that kind of irks me about mmorpgs is that regardless if they are gold or beta test is meaningless. They are always in beta test even after they go commercial. Just stumbled upon a bug today that after you die you have to click for your skills then click accept or else your 1st aid kits and treatments will be screwed up and you cant heal.

Uberling @ 10/22/2002 1:01:34 AM (60972):
Yes, you are right, type of damage caused death leads to diff animations, for example: poison damage - long death animation, projectile damage - no death animation at all.
One more point: with my OT Kerans (poison damage) i kill 30-40 mobs per solo mission. 40x4 sec — 3 additional minutes per mission x amount of missions — 30 add minutes per day and finally x amount of players (say 20000 persons using poison or chemical weapon) we got 10 000 HOURS per day ppls watching death animation. I think it's way FC increases play time you pay for.

Inyuendo @ 10/22/2002 2:00:15 AM (60972):
I agree that increased time in-game to kill the same # of MOBs with those damage types is definitely a (by the players, unwanted) side effect.

I don't actually believe that it's a ploy to gyp the player base, since it's not actually *necessary* to use those dmg types (switch to a different weap), nor is it consistent (i.e., the 'regular' death animations play at a reasonably fast rate). Nor is it necessary to stand there and wait for the MOB to stop its death throes, at least in a mission. Just move on to the next MOB, and come back to the previous corpse to loot it when done. Unless it's the last MOB in the mission, in which case yes, you're screwed, albeit at a much slower rate (1/30th - 1/40th of the original rate) than having to waste half an hour a day waiting for this kind of stuff.

But yes, it is annoying... especially getting the server-side notification that I can loot, when client-side, I can't. And no, it's not desynch. If anything, it's to eliminate the annoyance factor alone that FC should hasten to fix this. One less annoying thing = more happy players. Simple.

Inyuendo @ 10/22/2002 2:08:01 AM (38880):
BUMP.

Disgustingly annoying (infuriating) bug.

Inyuendo @ 10/22/2002 2:26:14 AM (58628):
Yes, Verant did a lot of things half-baked with EQ, but their Live Team seemed to pick up momentum around the time McQuaid left.

The thing I appreciated about Verant (at times) was their seeming willingness to listen to the community regarding bugs, gameplay mechanics, and the like.

At some point, there even appeared to our wondering eyes, a willingness on their part to admit mistakes and to make their game genuinely better and more enjoyable for the majority of the subscribers.

No, I'm not a VAK, and I don't like/play EQ (used to). And yes, there were/are still (many?) things not right with EQ...

What AO needs (among other things) is to have a dev team motivated to "do their game right". I am seriously getting the impression that everything posted in this forum is falling on deaf ears, because frankly, I think that the developers know damn good and well what the bugs are. FC is either including many bug fixes with the release of the booster pack or is waiting to see how it sells before funding the dev side of things (i.e., to fix the legacy issues).

I really think that this forum has been relegated to the sole role of providing a place where people post about a problem, and someone posts a workaround solution to that problem. Apart from that, we may as well be farting into a vacuum, as far as hoping anything we say matters.

Telekon @ 10/22/2002 3:00:42 AM (38880):
OMG this drives me nuts.

I use Windows XP.  I'd say I lose about 1 in 5 missions i 'try' to accept.

This bug is absolutely nerve wracking when you lose that mission reward you just camped the mission terminals for 20 minutes to get.

Telekon @ 10/22/2002 3:01:55 AM (61106):
I replied to the other thread, but I'll do whatever it takes to bring this to FC's attention.

Please fix this BUG!

Uberling @ 10/22/2002 3:41:51 AM (Fix Russian Good Days plz. 61308):
Game think it's melee weapon, despite it fires bullets and use single Submachine guns skill. 
It was ok on low levels, but at 100+ mobs PARRY about 30% attacks. 
If fixed, Russian G'Days is decent weapon, real alternative to OT Kerans or Chem maussers, they looks nice and can be dual wield.

Harammer @ 10/22/2002 6:02:33 AM (Take the lift to the boss room, and pet no longer under my control 61334):
I was doing a team mission tonight, and when I took the lift to the boss room, suddenly Bubba was no longer under my control at all, and every attempt to manipulate him was met with "You have no pet."  I had to run away and create a new pet, and of course buff him (I had just finished buffing the jerk before he went rogue).

Then I beat up the boss, and then had dueling Bubba's. 

This pet was not OE, I was perfectly capable of self casting him. This behavior worries me.

Harammer @ 10/22/2002 6:06:21 AM (Took a door, and it took me to the wrong area! 61335):
I was in Borealis tonight, and was going to the hi-tech store (the one that sells vehicles) to meet a friend. I entered the door and found myself... not in the shop that was for sure. It was some weird room with a few pieces of furniture. I shrugged, and left the room, and when I zoned out of the room, I ended up in the store where I was trying to go in the first place.

xyberviri @ 10/22/2002 6:42:06 AM (60848):
this problem has been around since beta, infact in beta it would pop up on a regular basis in missions. But really it only happens when your running to fast, you either have to pause every couple of seconds when you run or you have to force a client/server update(easiest way is to hit "U" then "Accept" IE skills system.)
this happens more and more with less bandwidth. 
this is related to the invisible team mates bug also.

Sredni @ 10/22/2002 6:57:30 AM (60848):
Ya old bug. I used to get this when I was a lvl 100ish soldier blitzing missions. This musta been like a year ago now.

 Running through a mission, then the doors would go black and you wouldn't be able to leave the room, and you wouldn't see a mob but you could see yourself taking damage, and hear the mob hitting you.

 Hasn't happend to me like that in ages tho. I have noticed lately doors that go black, but then all I do is turn away and wait 15 or 20 seconds and turn back and the door is back in place.

				It has to be more important to fix this issue than to keep rolling out new stuff, after all doing missions constitutes the vast majority of players time in the AO world, so logically the missions should be the most polished system in the game. Unfortunately despite 3 patches this is still not the case.

Kill this problem NOW.
			
		
	
I strongly disagree here. The problem isn't that missions have bugs, the problem is that they should make it so that players have some incentive for playing outdoors. Missions have had their share of improvement already - whatever how much stuff you add in those, they still remain boring pseudo-random dungeons.
Missions shouldn't constitute the majority of playing time... If I wanted to play a game with stupid dungeons, I could as well play diablo.

Warfang @ 10/22/2002 8:32:33 AM (61308):

I don't know if it works for you or not.  His situation is that his char run so fast that the client is not updating fast enough.  Maybe, this trick can shorten the duration of black door for your case.

Why make something Unique if you can only wear / use one at a time?

I mean if you have to meet the Requirements to use it.
 
Like the Flurry of Blows comes to mind.. Is it still Unique?

I remember when the MA attacks were Unique, how STUPID was that? And it was hell to get the UNIQUE tag dropped.

The Reflect Bracer comes to mind, and its slotted.  Meaning you can only wear ONE OF THEM.  But if you find a ql40(I think this is the right QL) it requires TitleLevel 3 to wear but TitleLevel 3 is lvl 50.  So to pick it up for later use, u must destroy the one u are wearing.

Marlark @ 10/22/2002 10:55:10 AM (60848):
Yup have existed for a long long time only that it is the fast movements that create the problems...

Usualy it is the uncontrollable movements .... I noticed with my brother when he play on my computer his char and mine is equal fast when it come to blitzing missions or moving fast ... the dif bet. us iswhen he run he run in the mission like well very uncontrollable and he get alot of black doors while me i dont get it unless there is some serius lag .. i did a litle test where i did the same thing i intentiualy moved myself in a very uncontrollable way when blitzing a couple of missions... and well i got a couple of black doors. But i noticed when i saw the grafics move strange i backed up very fast and it corrected itself on a couple of ocations but mostly it got totaly out of sync then. And at a couple of times the srmmgr did a low prio message on resources that came up in chat.

I sent in a report to FC two weeks ago regarding this .. because some of my org members got a litle  over the fact that they crashed alot when blitzing missions.

There is also another thing that is a litle irritable and that is when you go to fast into a area where there is alot of chars .... they client crashes and char end up in a logon loop.  Have happened 2 times l8tly for me ... first was on Johndoo's wedding and the second was on a Tara raid in the dongeon.

The fun thing here is if i took a alt char and walked slowly into the area the problem did not happen.. in my tests when i got this i managed to get 2 of my chars in logon loops and then finaly doing the slow walk it was no problem any more.

I bel these two problems are related in some way. Wouldnt surprice me if one get solved the other get fixed by that solution.

PS *me hope FC fixes this because it would also fix a couple of other problems when massiv movement is done fast ingame.

// Marlark, *Waves* to the audience.

RedSonja @ 10/22/2002 10:57:47 AM (61335):
I've had something similar before.
I was doing a mission in Home, alas it was full of those nasty, nasty Orange Enforcers and I was having to do a lot of fleeing.
One such flee, I exited the mission and instead of being outside the mission in Home I was outside a warehouse in Tir!
I went back into the warehouse but it was empty, not my mission.
Then had to go back to Home and get back into my mission, of course nasty Enforcer had healed up by then.

A shock to the system to say the least.

Fakonamo @ 10/22/2002 2:32:36 PM (Org bug problem 61410):
ever since 14.5 I've had this problem.  GMs (4 different ones) have tried and failed to fix it.

I am the Leader of my org.  I play regularly and have no problems with my account.  Every day or so (maybe sooner) an org vote starts to elect a new Leader due to inactivity. (Sometimes I am even logged on when this happens)  If I stop the vote with /org stop vote I crash the entire zone I am in and get dropped from my org (not kicked, just no longer in org) and Leadership defaults to another.

If I wait for the vote to end (even if no one votes) I get dropped from the org and Leadership defaults to another.

One GM who took over the org to test something picked up this bug and couldnt leqave the org and crashed the zone trying to get out.

I am getting really sick of this.  It has now happened 9 times and no one can fix it.  Should I just be left to suffer this problem, not to mention be left with the power to crash any zone I please simply by performing a normal org function?  Fix this now!

Fakonamo @ 10/22/2002 2:34:58 PM (61335):
If you have machines upgrade,you can see that there is a second door behind the first in may shops in Borealis.  I have been able to access these by flying at an angle towards the door.  

There are alot of cool static rooms around, hunting them down is kinda fun

MartekO @ 10/22/2002 2:57:12 PM (61335):
Most of the shops along that main line in Bor have that second "transporter" door to some room behind the main shop door.  A buddy of mine is quite good at getting into all of them.  He climbs onto the roof and knows how to drop down "in between" the two doors and zone at-will into the "extra" rooms.

Harammer @ 10/22/2002 3:17:16 PM (61334):
There were two engineering pets. One that was under my control, and the old one that was considered an enemy mob. I put my original pet out of his misery with my new pet. Sadly, my old pet was beating the tar out of my new pet even though the new one was fully buffed and required a good bit of healing to pull it off.

Sohjiro @ 10/22/2002 4:26:36 PM (Invisible walls in West Athen 61439):
Minor, but annoying problem. Ever since 13.5 or something, there has been modeling errors in West Athen. Anyone who frequents there knows what I mean. If you're at the bank/insurance/reclaim area on the hill where WA is split in half and decide to run west to the Superior or Advanced store, you are stopped by a snall invisible wall. The solution is to jump. Everyone knows this, its just annoying.

The same problem is by the hill in between the Advanced and Superior stores. 

These are minor errors and by no means halting gameplay in a horrible way, its just that they are damn annoying and have been there for over 6 months. I just wanted to know if Funcom is aware of it.

p00finger @ 10/22/2002 6:32:54 PM (Grid Armor 4 Bug 61472):
ATTENTION!!!  There is a severe bug involving Grid Armor 4!

After you equip it, something happens and it turns your character into a broken, worthless, PvP title-whoring, unbalanced, skilless, piece-of-cheese.  This must be addressed immediatly!  It tends to make a high level fixer stand in Tir arena acting like he has one ounce of skill.  In fact, It seems like it removes a fixer from the game completely and replaces it with a souless husk pretending to be a fixer.  A doppleganger of sorts.

I think it's gone unnoticed for so long that the GA4 bug has spread like a virus.  You may have noticed fixers vanishing off both dimensions and being replaced by GA4'xers.  Like maybe it's multiplying from gay-blue seed pods.

Another interesting side effect of the GA4 bug, is it uses a reverse psychology regarding gameplay.  It's backwards!  Like some kind of Bizarro Armor!  Like a child possessed by a satanic demon speaks backwards!  You see, instead of the GA4'xers doing damage in PvP...they defend you to death!  That's right!  Certain broke-ass, highlevel GA4'xers' damage is laughable.  But they kill you simply because you can't hit them at all.  I mean, how many football games have been won with Defense being the only strategy?  How's that for complete protonic reversal?  This my cause a dangerous schism in the space-time continuum!

Funcom.  Please address this demonic tragedy.  There are so few true fixers left.  I sadly see them fighting for their souls as GA4'xers try to push their cancer on them like a sleazy crack dealer.  This is by far worse than our beloved Martial Artists mysteriously getting LLT Scopes stuck in their HUDs.  

PLEASE HELP!  I beseech thee!

Harammer @ 10/23/2002 2:56:35 AM (The quickest way for me to get aggro: reload my gun. 61611):
I have a level 30 Engie, with a higher QL aggression trimmer and a red con bot, and I'm using a grenade launcher. The mobs don't seem to care when they parry my grenades, they sometimes care about my damage, and there are times I can do a 300+ crit hit and not get aggro from my bot. But heaven help me if I accidentally let the game manage the reloading of the gun. The moment I see the "reloading" message appear, mobs go into red alert status and make a beeline to me.

Perhaps Enforcers should be issued these grenade launchers and  then reload them to pull aggro. 

Something is seriously hosed with the aggro on reload.

Harammer @ 10/23/2002 3:02:47 AM (Quest item placement in dungeons 61613):
I'm running into the problem of quest items stuck in the walls more and more frequently, requiring an ARK to help locate them.

I make sure that every mission I do counts. If I'm doing a mission, it's because it will reward me with an item I need. I don't have any high level chars to give me items/cash, and I don't have a guild to hand me this stuff. This is the way I earn my wages, and it's a total time waster to have to get an ARK to check into it for me.

Naturally I don't have this problem in team missions, as the quest item is always in the boss room. But the item for solo missions is always placed in a semi-random part of the map. Maybe if they would make a special room containing the item, similar to the boss room. It doesn't have to have a boss, or any mobs, but should have a lift to it or something BIG indicating where it is. I've yet to encounter a lift so hidden that I couldn't find it.

This isn't a fatal bug, but it sure is a time consuming and frustrating problem.

Actually, that should be a QL36 Yalm.
Glad to see that you were able to equip it.

If I'd known that's what you were selling, I could have helped you out with the 30k.  OUCH!  That musta hurt.

Oh, and to keep it on topic, I too have run into the all black doors bug.  Tonight seems especially bad...  esp. when you're blitzing 100% missions.  The bad part is, I'm located in NC w/ a fast connection.  If I'm not mistaken, FC's servers are in NC as well.  WTF is wrong with that picture?

There are few save-terminals, where you resurrect somewhere else than where you saved. This is very irritating, and seems to happen everytime you die. List of bugged saves:

-Newland Desert whompas save term:
Save here, resurrect in rhino cockpit. Seems to happen every   time you save. Very irritating, because the distance is pretty long, and wandering to "Treacherous Pit" (or something like that) can be quite lethal for clanners (5 omni guards).

-Broken Shores whompas save term:
Save here, resurrect in waterfalls.. Can be quite lethal, anun tearers and greywolfs are around.

-Wine saving term:
This is bad one, saving here results in resurrection in "The Root". My level 75 agent had no chance to make it back, the was "Energy Sucker" (what a sucker=) next to reclaim, which killed me 3 times a row 2 seconds after resurrection, which activated the chain death protection and teleported me to Tir. Distance to Wine was very very veeryy long too. A nerve cracking one...

Well have anyone been smitten by this? Well for a few months I was heh till I raised my skill a little - see if you watch your hp/stats while zoning they drop a little then perk back up - if you have implants in for flying or if your flying skill is at the exact # need to fly the yalm - when you zone you will be on foot.  Happens alot to people anoying bug. So untill funcom fixes this you may just want to raise your flying skill some more.

sapphireblue @ 10/23/2002 4:54:08 PM (A bot walks into a room..... 61789):
I was doing a solo mission in a Lush Fields cavern last night with my engineer.  

I send my bot into the next room to attack the MOB.  The bot actually makes it into the room.  After about a minute, I open the door up, and discover that the MOB is on one side of the SIGN in the middle of the room, and that my bot is on the other side of the SIGN.  As best I can tell, they are sitting down, having a nice chat about the weather.

If the sign in the middle of the room is going to screw up pet pathing, please remove it.

It's back... I'm "Ticked off"

Remember the old bug where you are getting pounded by an npc in a mission and you zone to survive with plenty of health left?

Suddenly you die while zoning because the server won't stop the damage from the mob???

It's baaaaaaak.

I now intend to nolonger play until this is fixed.  I've lost 6 levels worth of xp from this before. (close to 1 mil xp lost before with 100k added today)

binaural @ 10/24/2002 3:09:53 AM (about the click mission accept and poof. 61963):
I have blitzed a thousand missions lately and i hate this bug but i think i know what the problem is.

it happens 99% of the time when trying to pick a 3rd BS home mission right?

so i figure that the 3rd mission you are getting has the exact same location as one of the other 2, thus it wont give it to you.. i even checked a few times and i cant seem to get 2 missions with the same coords.

i did so many missions there blitzing nanos that i have discovered there are really only 10 -12 mission locations in all of BS. thus allowing for duplicates when pulling 3.

let me know what u think.

...well at least to players it is.

Solitus female shows the shoulder pads (actually 2 of them stacked inside each other) but not the chestpiece.

Aipex @ 10/24/2002 7:18:17 AM (60848):
I think it must be bandwidth related because I've only seen a black door once and that was with my slow engie long ago. I've got a 128 fixer and I run pretty dern fast and I've never had the problem.

Oh, and the time that it happened to my engie, I tried running through the black door and I went LD. When I logged back on all the mobs in the mission (that I had already killed) where back in place! I died quickly as you can well imagine.

caramster @ 10/24/2002 9:27:30 AM (60848):
Yeah. This problem must be fixed asap. 

I get black doors/severe warping when i switch between sneak mode and running. Theese problems occur most when i switch between sneak and speed buffed run mode. The bigger the difference in run speed, the more likely to get server desync.

My other chars depends on my Agent to get them Equipment and Credits.

I found out why NANORESIST doesnt work, and does work. 

I was looking thru the Doc Programs and I found this program to BOOST NanoResist.  I thought  YEAH buddy.  Well here is the kicker, when cast it raises Disease AC.  

So I figure, this must be like what they did to the MAs originally.  Weve all been raising the wrong Skill, or in this case AC, to get NanoResists.

Oh, and just for kicks I sent this Prog in some time back and was told it would be looked into, guess what?  NOT YET.

Forged @ 10/24/2002 4:59:53 PM ("/org bank add" issue 62130):
I attempted to add to my org bank last night (10/23) and kept getting 'You can not add more credits than you own'. This happened even when I attempted to only add a single credit.

I have a lot more than a single credit, so I could not understand this. Is there an issue with bank exploiting that I am unaware of and FC has frozen the /org banks?

sapphireblue @ 10/24/2002 5:43:58 PM (61789):
So, last night, I'm doing a mission in 20k with my engi, and I discover that my bot has romulan stealth technology.

I've cleared most of the level, and am running around, trying to find the last few MOBs.  Target a MOB, look around, and discover that my BOT isn't there.  Ok, no problem, I'll just trace my route back to find the bot humping the wall.  Can't find him.

Ok, so I do a /pet report and discover that the bot is in the same room as I am.  Move around a bit, and discover that the bot is moving with me for a change.  Send the bot in to attack the MOB, and it says it's attacking, but does no damage to the MOB, who just looks confused.

My only possible conclusion.  The BOT's are discovering stealth technology, and will soon being taking over Omni-tech. Maybe they already have, and Ross is just being controlled by an invisible BOT puppet master

Tiggy @ 10/24/2002 6:31:48 PM (60848):
The thing is im not all that fast 550ish (un-buffed which is usually how I sneak) and I have a nice fat 1mb ADSL connection. 

If I just Blitz then 99% of the time there is no problem and as pointed out already if the doors do turn black while Blitzing usually you can back up and fix the problem. BUT if you CHANGE SPEED (drop out of sneak and start running) there is a massively increased chance (up to 4 in 5 missions) of getting black doors and when you do backing up DOES NOT work. I no longer wear armour while sneaking as it only prolongs the dieing process. 

There is something fundamentally wrong with the code if the server is unable to tell the client where it is. These syncing problems don’t happen in games like quake and BF1942 (which are handling far more delicate and complex positioning problems than an AO mission) there is no excuse for them in Anarchy. 

I haven’t added any IP’s to run for over 75 lvls yet the black door problem has defiantly got worse over the last few months.


	
		
			
			
				I strongly disagree here. The problem isn't that missions have bugs, the problem is that they should make it so that players have some incentive for playing outdoors. Missions have had their share of improvement already - whatever how much stuff you add in those, they still remain boring pseudo-random dungeons.
			
		
	
With all due respect this problem IS more important than any other issue such as new content or the nerfing of LLTS which really does only affect a small amount of the people a small amount of the time. Being an agent I do a massive amount of sneaking to acquire stuff for guildies and friends, sometimes as many as 30 or 40 missions in a day, precisely because people don’t want to spend their time in missions getting this stuff for themselves, they want to go off and play in dyna camps or team for some nice safe BS xp. Sneaking is what I do well it is my professions speciality. There is nothing more annoying than being slowed down or held up when trying to get through a massive shopping list by this form of ridiculous death. When this happens to you in well over 50% of the missions you are sneaking, a 4 hour shopping spree becomes 6-8 hours and you become extremely irritable and frustrated. Missions always have and always will be the things people spend the vast amount of their time doing, not just for the xp, but for the items and equipment they need and desire. I suppose there is always the option of telling people to get their own damn stuff and they can struggle with black doors too but then what would be the point of being in a guild if the agents refused to get you stuff because they were fed up with getting killed in a tedious manor acquiring items for your benefit?

This problem needs to be fixed and fast.

Tiggy  


	
		
			
			
				There is also another thing that is a litle irritable and that is when you go to fast into a area where there is alot of chars .... they client crashes and char end up in a logon loop. Have happened 2 times l8tly for me ... first was on Johndoo's wedding and the second was on a Tara raid in the dongeon.
			
		
	
Apparently having a large friends list can contribute significantly to zoning and logging problems, particularly in busy areas (don’t you just hate people who send you a tell for a buff).

Heh, this problem seems to occur to me when I've been searching for "that specific item" a very long time and when I've finally found it and clicked accept.... nothing.

When that happens I usually log off (alt /quit) and then do something else... very annoying.

I would rather say that it is time we realize that Funcom doesn't care abiut this bug...

theBro @ 10/25/2002 5:39:20 PM (62323):
I thought this only happened to me...

been trying to figure out why it does this (finally find your much sought after item, click accept, window closes...and no mission) I have wondered whether it has to do with how much I am clicking around on the mission icons. Im thinking if I click the mission icon multiple times or if I click around back and forth through the icons alot, then I have problems. If i click it once to select it then hit accept, it usually works OK.

If we can figure out the exact scenario in which this problem always happens, then I'll bet we can get it fixed.

then again if it is just a random bug experienced by only a few people...I think we all know what we can expect.

Slickblue @ 10/25/2002 8:42:33 PM (62323):
hehe, i sat in Tir once I went through several missions because when I uploaded it to my map and check inside the mission and they both pointed to home. Then when I hit accept and uploaded it to my marker, I found that it was either going to Southern Foul Plains or Avalon. That is at the Tir grid machines. I usually get the ones that dont show up near Fair Trade in Tir, other than that, I've yet to have a problem at any of the others.

Dunsany @ 10/25/2002 10:24:28 PM (62323):
This seems to happen to me when I try to get three missions to blitz for items to use or sell. Too often it seems the second or third mission doesn't get accepted. It happens often enough that I usually only take one mission at a time to blitz now.

I wonder if using Win98SE and/or ClickSaver has anything to do with this.

Noticed a problem lately.

Sometimes people cant join the team im member/leader of, because they get: "Cant join team during fight"-message. At the end the only solution is for me to terminate my bot, and then the problem disappears. Now this can sometimes be a bit of a problem... Suddenly im stuck with a selfbuffed pet, because a teammember LD'D, or something......... And it happens even if i zone to another area, exit the mission etc.. And there are DOTs on the pet either (mob was confirmed killed...)

Would be nice to have it fixed....

Lokgen @ 10/26/2002 6:41:14 AM (58840):
I agree, Please fix this terrible bug. No way should groups / packs of mob's warp from great distances and continue a damage spam attack against players.  

Conspiracy theory one :  Game developers didn't like players rushing the boss and killing it, then running off without having to kill the minions. The *fix was to make the Dynacamp minion mobs chase after a player regardless of his / her runspeed skill. 


Regular non boss/minion models are warping through game geometry also.

Lokgen @ 10/26/2002 6:54:59 AM (61692):
I agree, fix the Wine reclaim resurrection point. Same thing has happened to me a few times.

Plus one of the problems is wandering Blood Stoppers and Energy Suckers get stuck inside the the walls and rock geometry of the reclaim area and will remain there untill killed or the server is rebooted.

I was so annoyed one time, I went back and spent about 30 minutes pulling the stuck mobs out of the reclaim area.... and yes they suffered a painful death =P.

This is so very true. I don't know what it is, it wasn't until I reached 100th I think that I started noticing this. I've had exactly the same thing as the person above.

The one time I remember the most was, I was idle for a bit.. they were fine, we were smashing our way through mobs.. I come back and run over to join the others. I target the mob, which is about half health, two enforcers bashing it, and suddenly the mob runs over and smacks me for an 868 crit, before running back to the enforcers. I was like, what the hell?!?!

And it seems to happen almost all the time. I might be the last in the room, but I still get a shot or two in me before the mob switches target again. Its incredibly annoying. It doesn't happen all the time, but enough to be noticable.

On the subject of Unique items, can you have mission won uniques appear in an overflow box or something. I did a mission for a new Flurry of Blows, but when I completed the mission I didn't get anything because I already had one. My intention was to delete the one I had and get the new one from the overflow box, where I assumed it would go. Bad idea. I had to find a new mission and try again.

Animosity @ 10/26/2002 3:44:48 PM (58840):
I have seen this too much, and watched it happen to other people. Its frustrating not knowing how far to have to run to finally get out of their range. 

(((((please dont read this next part and think that i am supporting the way it is, but rather this is the attitude that I think is prevelent among the designers, and hard core rpg'rs out there (((((i am not a hardcore rpgr, i do have dragon dice, but dont think it should be a governing lame bottom excuse))))))->what some would say: The RPG world is based on the logic of chance and probability. Your avatars are general representations of what is happening in the numbers game. While the MOB appears that he is warping to you he actually has been on your tail ever since you started warping, the gui interface is not as accurate as numbers game. Remember all is secondary to that numbers game, and you should probably have your dice, a slide ruler and alot of paper with you while playing to make sure this does not happen again. We are trying to fix the gui as fast as we can, but the game, the numbers game is working correctly, so we dont want to break that at this time for some wimpy gui representation of the real stuff)))))))))

Eurus @ 10/26/2002 5:02:31 PM (62323):
Have you every thought it may be because the missions are in the same building/door? The keys have problems when they all open the same door into different places. Put your keys in a bag and only keep one in your inv at a time. This seems to keep this problem from occurring.

Possibility I suppose.  I haven't done any testing against it.  But I'll try putting them in bags and seeing what happens.  Would be kewl if that's all it is.

Netsuke @ 10/26/2002 6:09:11 PM (62323):
This has happened to me in the past also, but not anymore. I use Clicksaver, so once I find a mission I want, I minimize ALL open windows (including the in game map) except the AO window. Then I click on the mission icon at least twice, then hit accept. It has never happened to me again.

Greybear @ 10/26/2002 6:33:46 PM (58428):
That would be nice also.  Ive even had problems where the mission reward was a Unique Item and the Find Item was the Item I was going for, but because I had the Unique it wouldnt even let me in the mission.

Big question:

Why is the Flurrys UNIQUE?  it can be used in 3 different slots.  Has a recharge timer? This would be helpful if not UNIQUE in case your RANSACKED and need to use.  You could carry three of varying QL.

hobbes @ 10/26/2002 11:19:14 PM (Stop the cover ups! 62754):
When fighting in mission front rooms, it is often necessary to zone when your health is low. You must zone while your health is above the "critical hit" of your opponent because of client server lag.

You learn this when you kill a mob, look at his dead body, then die seconds later from weapon damage (the parting shots, I like to call them).

Anyway, if you happen to kill the mob while zoning with your parting shot, you get no credit for the kill. When you zone back in the mob is gone.

At the end of the mission, you see you have a 97% chance of token, but everyone is dead. So the mob was counted in calculating the mission success %, but never registered as dead. He essentially goes into a black hole.

What's up with this cover-up?

A good run is better than a bad stand anyday, I should get credit for the kill. I am surprised I haven't seen this mentioned before, but I finally got irritated enough today to post this long time problem.

Conveniently, I have calulated that you owe me 1.2 million xp,(over the 100+times this has happened) please add that to my character at your earliest convenience.

Really, each occurance is only a minor inconvience and I am more intrigued by what is actually occuring than angered by it. I am a computer lay person, I'm wondering where this data goes?

But as interesting as this is, I would still like this ip loophole fixed.

Greybear @ 10/27/2002 3:26:22 AM (62754):
Not sure its a cover up.  

I havent said anything about it because if I have to run for the zone, Im just glad Im not dead.  Many others are prolley the same as me on that.

Think its like a game mechanic, if your not in the zone be it your last shot on in some cases DoTs then no credit is issued.

Also, Ive found something else that is of point.  Sometimes when I have zoned to avoid death and returned the NPC/MoB isnt anywhere to be found.  I know he wasnt close to death.  Ive completed the whole mission to find one of two things:
1) They respawn in the room they first started at after a few minutes.
2) Are waiting at the front door when I goto Leave.

I think this is kinda like the Disappearing pet trick, they are chasing u and have excellent following ability.  Your coords show u just beyond the mission wall, and they follow.  You in fact are zoning, but do to lag they still have u targeted.  Thus u return, they have lost your target and are essentially behind the Walls.\, under floor, in cieling.

Just a thought.

Ok , the contraversy has started now that Omni Has regained its ability to bring mass's to camelot . I applaude omni and the people behind them that orginized them to be a powerfulll force inwhich to take over camelot , but at the same time i am disgusted at tactics used . I am not here to discuss the tactics , i am here to settle sevral arguments inwhich people have been petitioned for . 

So we start off with this item first :

1) Are GMs/ Arks allowed to " move " players who are in one Playfeild while the opposing side is trying to open another ? 

my answer is no . Reason: Everyone is allowed to do as they see fit , that makes them happy . If i want to sit on the round table in camelot and talk / chat to friends and guild i should have that right. Am i ruining your fun or chances of opening another pf ? Is sitting there on my time and game payed dollars fun for me ? yes , if it suits a purpose such as getting things solved and chatting with friends . If it means u cant get the 4th tara to spawn then thats not my problem , i am enjoying the game as i see fit . ( see next question for further explanation) 


2) is opening another alternate Playfeild allowed or an exploit ? 

Many sides to that debate . The dungeons themselfs have a player limit , once that player limit is reached another playfeild will open . That seems fine to me . That is what is intended . BUT ... exploiting that gamne mechanic by haveing logged "alts" into those playfeilds and then clearing one dungeon out and logging those alts in to open the next is IMHO an exploit of this game mechanic . 

The questions are simple , pls define what we can or cant do . pls inform us if it is an exploit and will be treated as such or if it is exceptable . Pls let me know if im allowed to enjoy the game as i see fit or if i will have to obey what people dictate to me and ruin my own personal fun in the game .

Harammer @ 10/27/2002 7:04:08 PM (Engie pet cast vs activation requirements 62915):
I was so happy to discover that I had the requirements to cast the Patchwork Gladiatorbot nano. Then I discovered I was 5 short in the skills to activate it. 

That's seriously lame. More than half a nano bar and a few hundred credits later, and I'm stuck with a UNIQUE shell that I have to delete so I can create a pet I can activate.

Either up the nano cast requirements to match the activation requirements, or lower the activation requirements to match the cast requirements. There's no reason why there should be such a huge difference.

And if you claim that you can't do that to some delusionary balance issues, then CLEARLY STATE THE ACTIVATION REQUIREMENTS IN THE NANO DESCRIPTION. (Caps lock intended) There is no reason to decieve the poor engies like that.

These bots are my weapons and armor. How many weapons do you see that have one skill requirements to wield it, and another to fire it? If you did this to the SMG or Beam weapon categories, you'd have people up in arms and leaving this game in droves.

Inyuendo @ 10/27/2002 8:13:01 PM (58840):
I started an agent alt. While in the OT newbie area, I used Aimed Shot on some monsters that were at the rifle's maximum range. Right after getting the message , "You hit xxxx for yyyy points of Aimed Shot damage", the monster I was fighting basically teleported to my location. In other words, when I used my Aimed Shot, the monster was apparently 30 yards away. One second later, it was right next to me. It couldn't have been the monster's run speed, since we're talking about level 1 monsters here. 

This happened a bunch of times (but not every time), and my ping was very low (like around 20-40). Server desynch? MOBs cheat? All the above? You decide.

(Edit: removed angry comment).

I got at least 2 sets of those bugged bags when they were around...

But I still have an odd bug... I have my apartment key sitting in the bank (character went Omni, from Neuterd) and whenever it sits in the bank, it's a blue question mark.  but If I move it to my regular inventory, it changes back to the key !!!  and in fact, after one of the patches, it dissapeared completely for a few weeks then reappeared in the bank.

No idea there... hehe I should go back to my apartment in Newland, see if the roller rats have moved in.  Should put a big chocolate cake or bronto burger in the middle of the floor for them

We just starting getting the resist from hell....  it used to be a rare occurance for any mobs to resist, now we're having the same mob resist progs at least 3-5 times a combat, usualy in a row.

TemplarRed @ 10/28/2002 10:14:20 AM (60756):
I can't say that I've noticed any change.

Team heals have always been aggro magnets.  If you're looking to avoid aggro, try using single-target heals instead.  Singles are far more effective anyway (unless the team is faced with one or more adds).  

Sometimes I'll use team heals if I'm trying to pull aggro.  If I can land a good crit & run a team heal (or speed debuff) back-to-back, I can almost get an enemy's attention.. unless someone else is landing multiple special attacks & strong crits in succession.

I would not recommend lowering your def/agg slider unless you are still able to run heals instantly.  Both you & your team will be safer if you're able to insta-heal.  

I would, however, recommend maxing body dev.  This should be one the doc's top priorities, second only to after bio met, matter met, & treatment (all green skills).  Nano init is important, but not always neccessary to max to do insta-heals.

One other thing... try keep your HoT running on yourself if you don't trust your enforcer's ability to hold aggro.

Atreyu @ 10/28/2002 11:53:51 PM (Question on BBI Faithful Init 63296):
I was just looking at Auno's item database and the BBI Faithful gun, trying to figure out which ql to next get, and I noticed something that alarmed me considerably.  According to his page the BBI Faithful uses Melee Init!!  Upon checking the rest of his entries for the BBI Faithful series I was shocked to find they ALL have Melee Init as their Init skill listing! 

Now to my question   Is this an error in his database or is this true and how it really works in the game?  I'm hoping its a bug in his db, as it would seem odd that a ranged weapon (uses the pistol, flingshot and multi ranged skills, def skill is dodge ranged) would use melee init as its init skill.  If his db is correct and its a bug in AO, I hope it'll get put on the list for 14.6

Thanks

Harammer @ 10/29/2002 12:49:09 AM (Floating mobs 63316):
I know the mobs don't abide by any of the same rules that PCs do, but for goodness sake, can they at least obey the laws of gravity?

If you look closely, mobs in most missions seem to float several inches above the ground, as well as chests.

I really noticed this when I was running around in leet form with my young adventurer. It just looks silly when I'm looking up at the bottoms of their shoes.

Harammer @ 10/29/2002 1:38:25 AM (63296):
BBI Faithful's are currently using the wrong init. It is supposed to be fixed in 14.6 along with numerous other guns.

Yes, it's quite annoying to have bullets and grenades parried.

As a fun little test, I created an adventurer based on SOL fire executioner type C, and my friend created an adventurer on BBI Faithfuls. We are both the same level. There's just an incredible difference in the attack rate between the two of us, even though we both have maxed inits and the weapons have similar attack speeds. 

My SOL based ADV is far outdamaging his BBI based ADV because of init problems. I can watch the attack meters just freeze on his screen and his char will sit there for several seconds while it figures out what went wrong. And if the mob parries his bullets, his attack meter gets really messed up.

I have to recommend against BBIs until they are fixed.

Shadecat @ 10/29/2002 8:31:43 PM (Fixer NCU rebuffing bug 63568):
Are there any plans in the near future to fix rebuffing the Fixer's NCU buff lines?  As it stands now it's really annoying to have to get everyone on my team to stop and stand still for a minute, have them all kill any programs over their normal NCU limit, and kill the currently running NCU buff, then wait while I recast, and then rebuff all the stuff they had to shut down.  The buff exists to add NCUs without adding hardware to your belt, but it's almost gimped because it dosen't rebuff properly.  This is particularly true if you have a lot of high level buffs that you got from outside sources that you don't want to get rid of.

Is this planned to be fixed soon, hopefully in 14.6?  Please, please fix this, it (aside from the dark blue nano lines) is one of the biggest problems I have as a fixer (and other fixers as well, I hope).

Though lightening one of the nano lines to medium/light blue wouldn't hurt either. :P

odian102 @ 10/29/2002 8:40:31 PM (63568):
try rebuffing every 3 min. max. for a leaving. (wrangles, deprive, plunder, ac buffs. .............) now do it from lvl5-200. You have no idea what annoying is.

Shadecat @ 10/29/2002 9:09:35 PM (63568):
Yes but do those buffs require that you stop not only them, but also other programs before you recast?  Are those team buffs that have to be cast several times because it's a rare thing that everyone on your team actually listens to you when you say 'do this before i cast it'?

I'm sure it's pretty annoying, and if those are bugged then they should be fixed as well, but if they aren't bugged and it's just annoying because of game mechanics, then...that sucks.

At least I've been told the fixer NCU buff is a bug, if it's not and shouldn't be this way someone let me know. If it is supposed to be that way, my biggest question is of course: why?

It makes sense to be done like that anyway. You need 1 Free NCU to run the NCU buff to begin with. Refreshing it would be impossible since the previous buff has to be terminated first. If you have more programs then your "real" NCU can handle, canceling your previous NCU buff would leave you with 0 NCU, and not enough for the new buff.

Darkbane @ 10/30/2002 12:47:10 AM (63568):
Consider it a drawback rather than a bug. As Lucid says, refreshing kills the old copy before trying to start the new one... it may be annoying, but it sadly is logical.

Still, for such a useful buff its a small price to pay.

locomdenom @ 10/30/2002 12:56:38 AM (63568):
They've said they're going to fix it.  I want it fixed.

sounds almost like it might be intended that way, but that is not how buffs work.

 if your NCU buff wears off, and you now have lots of buffs the take more NCU than you normally have.. you can refresh any current buff you still have going as long as it is recast before it runs out. 

...which is what i do rather than ask eveyryone to stop so i or somone can recast the NCU buff and then rebuff over.. refreshing existing buffs over the course of missions is a way around it.. althought the bug is dam annoying :\

That doesn't matter as well, because there is a check to see if you have free NCU but not if you have the buff existing already.

I always felt that it was by design, because it takes 1 NCU, and if your NCU is 350/300, then there is no 1 free NCU to begin with to refresh it.

kaghelion @ 10/30/2002 9:46:10 AM (63568):
Well of course it's by design, but you can't even refresh it if you have NCUs to spare.
What other buffs are non-refreshable?

We are just pointing out that when you are in a team, doing complete rebuffs are a hazzle.
And lag and client/server sync aint helping.

When I'm solo I have no trouble with recasting the NCU buff.

No Eurus, that's not it.  I blitz missions all the time many many many missions a day to make money and I rarely get missions in the same door.  That's not it.

Ever since 13.9 patch they made it so you get more variety of missions each time you get a mission, and ever since then it's been bugged.  Sometimes you won't get the mission when hitting accept... that would have NOTHING to do with it being in the same building, AND it worked flawlessly before 13.9 patch so that's not it.  Another bug that Slickblue hit upon was how missions sometimes change their coord and what zone they're in after you've got them. 

The thing that really annoys me is, people have posted about this for 8 f***ing patches now.  EIGHT!!!

Ray @ 10/30/2002 12:21:07 PM (62323):
I've tested this to some degree and it only seems to happen when the mission is in the exact same location as another mission you already have.

I can reproduce this any time, so I guess it at least is connected to the location.

Seems alot of people are looking at it this way.  However, if your NCU is 350/300 why are you able to refresh all other buffs and not the NCU.  It is an bug.  If everyone followed this line of thinking all buffs above your normal would end as soon as NCU ran out.  Wouldn't that be great you loss all those buffs? I think it would be far easier and make much more sense to just allow the NCU to refresh.

Charibe @ 10/30/2002 1:52:51 PM (60756):
i hope it will be a sort of answer to ur problem kedryn,

first a part of ur complaint is a little incoherent. So u want to heal with no line of sigh and u complain about the mob who aggro u with no line of sigh ? hum...

More seriously : someone give u a part of the response to ur problem ; use personal heal not team heal. Team heal aggro it is one thing ya but personal is more efficient than team heal. i play a doc myself (and others chars) and i am bored with those who use team heal by facility ; they dont even know who is aggro cause they dont care of that sort of thing exept when they are aggro themselves... I just understand sometimes MAs who use this sort of heal cause they have dificulties to be in center of a storming fight and heal but that's all. Team heal is weak (in Hps healed) in comparison of personnal heal so use the personal.
But it is only a part of ur problem. the second part is more important than the first. Heal aggro it is a fact and i think it is normal cause if it doesnt aggro missions will become sooo boring (and trust me i know very well the reclaims terms and principaly BS one ). More i grow in level and more i understand that the team in which u are is more important than all other thing (it is true for NT too). If they dont understand that (from level 1 to 140) u are the first char to protect.... leave them u will easily find another team. U cannot imagine the number of people who never play with team window open, who dont care of who is aggro who just take mission like a rush into mobs that all ; let them rush and die... the leason would be learn... perhaps.
But another time it is only a part of the answer to ur complain. The last one is ur character... U said u die in 3 hits... hum i think noone can save u in this case as u, as doc, cannot save someone who die in 2 hits (cause the time to cast heal). I think i am a good doc (not cause i think that i am not pretentious a bit but cause people say it) but it has a price. I have to be always vigilant and i have to be quick very quick (and no team heal as i said). It exists only one way to be quick enough to keep a team in live : maxe ur nano init and play full offensive on slider (someone said it but dont insist enough on that). I know it is a very dangerous way of life but the most important is that people in team know that and act in consequence. Atm i am enough high to choose my team members, the friends i like to play with. So in all case before ur team react to ur aggro u have to be able to survive a time enough long to permit them to react and sorry to say that but 3 hits is to short (for a mezzer to mezz in case of add, for an enf to mongo... etc...) u have to survive longer. How u can do that ? I saw the advice max ur body dev... hum ya in a sense but it is not the center of problem. The more important is on one side ur AC to limit the normal damages u take (i choose personnaly agi strengh based armor but psy int is good too) AND on the other side (i insist a lot) ur evade skills to avoid critical strikes on u and then u will see that u resist like a majority of other class (exept enf of course or fixers in GA).

I hope i bring u a comprehensive answer.

If this was the intent of Funcom, perhaps they should change all nanoprograms to function in the same manner. Somehow I don't see that happening...

At any rate, free NCU or not, the buff does NOT refresh ever. It is annoying having to recast this buff 3-8+ times per mission because Funcom couldn't foresee issues like this.

Bump.

EVERYONE wants this. Who gives a rats *** about the mechanics of it, its annoying as hell, especially when combined with the "I am no longer in your list of programs but I'm still running for another 2 minutes, so you can't manually cancel me" bug.

Fun >>> "Intended" for this one. Good thing FC agrees. I doubt they "intended" for fixers to be casting this over and over and over and over and over and over and over...or for us to be asking for it over and over and over and over and over...

Hell, while they're at it, make it last longer. NCU is a royal pain in the butt, and even though fixers are popular, they aren't everywhere. Either that or give us some higher ql NCUs and let me cast my comp lit buffs on people above a certain level. (title3/4/5 or so) Don't limit the level of traders casting it though, not unless we get 5/level comp lit too. Since they said no more skill color changes ever...

BTW, fixers basically get a "free" color upgrade with the Hud3 item. It doesn't save them any IP, but the amount it gives is almost the same as going up to the next bracket.

What Hud3 item?  If you mean the NCU Hacker interface, that goes in Hud2, fyi, and I hardly think that qualifies as a free color upgrade.  Yes it's a very useful item, but it takes far too long to go up significantly, and when you get 20 or 50k for a level and dump all the IPs into a nano line because it costs that much to do so, it certainly doesn't seem like it's much of a help.  At least for me it seems that I do my character upgrading in spurts.  If I can afford enough IPs to get high enough to use that new nano I'll dump them in, but otherwise I wait until I have them free and do them all at once, rather than incrementally.  

This would be a lot less painful if the nano lines were cheaper.  Besides, the NHI only gains 1 point to each of the lines about every 3-4 levels, so it doesn't really keep up with the nano lines as fast as it could.  The max on it is only 61, which is definitely a good bonus for a (more or less) unused HUD slot, but is somewhat paltry at higher levels, IMO.  But maybe I'm just pissy because I'd like to use the Bootleg items/ammo/weapons/armor nanos but can't because that would require putting well over 400 ip into a dark blue stat.  It almost makes me glad I don't have GA so I don't have to think about dumping points into it, as I have yet to touch that one since creation of my character.

If you're referring to something other than the NCU Hacker Interface that actually does go into Hud3 please tell me about it and you'll be my new hero

Shadecat @ 10/30/2002 8:54:46 PM (63568):
Also, what is the point of having the NCU Buff not rebuff if it doesn't take out additional programs upon death.  If they want to make it realistic or something then when it goes it should also take down programs that are pushing the NCUs above the current max.  

That solution would probably result in members of the FC dev team being raked over hot coals, though, so the obvious solution is to make the NCU rebuff as normal rather than not.  Personally I see it as a balance between realism and playability.  Yes it would be more realistic to have it take out nanos and not be able to be rebuffed, but it's a nuisance really, and changing it is not going to radically alter the gameplay mechanics, it's just going to alleviate the headaches of most Fixers who are stuck in long team missions.

Inyuendo @ 10/30/2002 10:03:52 PM (62323):
This never(?) seems to happen when you have 0 missions uploaded, and rarely when you already have 1 mission uploaded. Very common though with 2 missions already uploaded. 

Easiest way to minimize the probability that it will occur: never take 3 missions at once. Gimpy workaround, but it reduces the annoyance factor.

Inyuendo @ 10/30/2002 10:23:05 PM (63316):
Yeah, MOBs seem to have major collision detection issues vs. the environment, especially in the vertical axis. They either float, as you point out here, or they sink into the ground if the ground is not perfectly flat (see my post in this forum about MOBs sinking below the terrain after they are killed). 

My only educated guess as to the reason that it's set up this way is that it provides some guarantee that the MOB won't spawn underground or that it won't attack you from below terrain level. I remember that in EQ you would also see MOBs that had just spawned sometimes 'floating' above the terrain. 

Why these games seem unable to handle collision detection properly, or at least as elegantly as standard FPS'es do, is open to debate. The only hypothetical explanation that I can provide is that MOBs that are not 'active', i.e., engaged in combat or in their roaming modes, don't 'need' to be detecting collisions against the environment. It is a well-known fact in the game industry that collision detection is usually CPU-intensive, so by making the MOBs float, they improve the server's efficiency. This may not seem like a big gain in the case of that one mission you're in where you see 2 floating chests or whatever, but multiply that by 1000 simultaneous missions that other people are doing...

Skyhigh @ 10/30/2002 11:57:54 PM (Mobs still fighting after death 63942):
What's the deal with that ?   Happen very often now and it's not lag related.   

I even get the XP from killing it and is still standing shooting at me for 2-3 sec before the death animation start !!!!

It's often like that 

You hit mob for 100 of damage (Last blow)
(Death music)
You received 500 xp
(Mob still standing and shooting)
Mob hit you for 25 of damage
(Mob Still standing and shooting)

Harammer @ 10/31/2002 4:47:28 AM (Yalms texture messed up while wearing battlesuit 63997):
I noticed something very strange when I was fooling around with some old armor.

I had a yalm equipped, and went into a store. While I was in the store, I equipped a battle suit. I left the store, and when I got outside I noticed my Yalm wasn't nice and shiny, but instead had the texture of the battlesuit I had on.

I noticed I could not equip my Yalm while wearing a battlesuit. But it let me keep my yalm equipped when I put on the battlesuit.

Unfortunately, nobody else can see the custom Yalm paint job but me.  Would have been cool if others saw it like this.

Rahmorak @ 10/31/2002 10:47:09 AM (Team Missions and "Still in a Fight" 64048):
OK, 

In a team mission if we use the button to teleport between levels should it not reset the "can't use that while in a fight" status?

Example 1)
A Fixer and myself were doing a team mission and got ambushed by 4 Virus Builders.  It was close but we had to run and the Fixer found the button and zoned.  But he couldn't use a MedKit and died from 4 DoTs (losing 70% of a levels XP in the process).

Example 2)
This one happens EVERY mission.  We battle through to the final boss and have to run.  After zoning I am unable to use kits (as I am still targetted by the Boss) and the Fixer has to go back and get aggro so that I can get my Nano and Health back up.

In situations where my team member has left before clearing the dungeon it leaves me unable to Fight the Boss MOB as I have to exit the mission in order to use my Kits (and of course the Boss is immune to calms).

I find this bug almost game-breaking and yet no-one seems to mention it so am I alone?  is FC aware of this?  Is that is how it is *meant* to work?  (I hope not!!!)

It has happened several times now after the last two serverpatches: I go linkdead in team missions while zoning to next floor, and logging into the game again, I have lost all gained xp and all my items are gone, waiting for me at reclaim. Nothing to do but terminate and get them...  

This has never happened to me earlier, and I must admit it is a very annoying way to loose xp. I believe I have lost more than 3 levels worth already the last week  (99 MP)

Now, I live in Norway, and even though it is said that the transatlantic line that went bad a little while ago is supposed to have become stable again, it is after this event this last add to gamebug frustration started. I have also noticed that I have more often an orange or red ping than before, and more glitches than usual. Actually, I have been almost free of glitches up until a couple of weeks ago.

That's been like that for a while, I don't think the gap is so bad when you get higher level though, and also with the many database sites out there I think there may be a way to dig up the bot casting requirements vs. the activation.

I'll have to look for that database, it sounds helpful.

But I still feel that I shouldn't have to go to a third party for information that should be somewhere in game, and that this problem shouldn't exist in the first place.

Fixers would be very pissed if their SMGs had different requirements to fire their guns than that required to equip them, and docs would be pissed if the skills to cast their heals was different from that to upload them.

Inyuendo @ 11/1/2002 4:25:08 AM (Very abnormal (buggy) gameplay while morphed 64299):
I was playing my pistol adventurer last night. I was in Tir city, and a higher-level adventurer decided to cast "Playful Cub" on me, which transformed ('morphed') me into a 2-headed wolf (this was the first time I had ever had this morph cast on any of my characters). 

I noticed that being morphed into this form provides an increase in all damage types. I decided to do a quick mission. I entered the mission and started fighting. 

While in the mission, I noticed several things about my combat with the MOBs that made me think that there are at least 2 serious issues that need to be examined (starting with the most important issue):

(1) Near the end of my first few fights, the MOB that I was fighting still displayed their health bar as having about 10% health left. Then I would get the "You received xxxx XP", "You can loot these remains", etc. messages, but the MOB was by all appearances still alive and well and fighting me. After about 5-10 seconds or so, the MOB would just flop over dead. After a few more fights, I then noticed that if I sat down with the MOB's health bar at 10% or so, the MOB usually died immediately and I got the XP and loot messages. 

All of this is to say, it seems to me that being morphed as a Playful Cub causes some sort of serious client/server desynch to occur; by sitting down with what seemed to be a MOB that was near death, I forced the server to update me (I suppose that using a health kit or anything else that could force an update would have had a similar effect -- untested). Very disconcerting, to say the least. It was like that for the duration of the mission (since I decided to stay morphed and the morph outlasted the mission).

(2) The animation for the wolf was very(!) strange. I admit that it must be tricky to come up with a way to animate a 2-headed wolf dual-wielding pistols, although this is not about aesthetics. The main problem was that there did not seem to be an accurate correspondence between the times at which I fired my guns and the animation of doing so... the animation seemed to occur 2-4 seconds after the shots were fired, or the animation *did not occur at all*. This was observable both in 1st and 3rd person camera views. The net effect of this was that I felt like I wasn't actively engaged in combat most of the time. I was getting the "You hit xxxx for yyyy damage" messages, but it felt like I was detached from the combat experience. My feeling is that it's part of the desynch issue I mentioned above in (1).

I was lucky enough to find myself some Sunglasses of Syncopated Heartbeats tonight. When I put them on, however, I noticed that instead of one, I was wearing at least four. Two in front of my face and two sticking out of the sides of my head. 

I checked Jayde's db (follow link above) and noticed that nearly everything about those glasses is the same as the Kataras, except for one thing: the Katara seems to have 7 different meshes for all breed/sex combos. The Pumpkin glasses just has the 7 meshes without the breed/sex requirements. I'm guessing this is why I'm seeing a bunch of glasses and that there are probably some stuffed away deeper inside my head as well

Mercatura @ 11/1/2002 10:36:59 AM (64307):
No, it really is a bug.

Shades of Lucub (nanomage shades) have the same bug, and if you look at them worn, they are at least double stacked. I bet they have at least 2 different meshes without breed/sex requirements as well.

I spotted an atrox wearing them (somehow) by being observant. He quickly took them off and zoned after I asked him about it, but not before I got a screenshot  though he got banned for something else a few days later.

Albrecht tank on solitus has a similar problem. Only pads (actually 2 sets of them) on females, only body on males.

I wonder if the opifex pad alignment problems are similar.

Qinefer @ 11/2/2002 12:39:33 AM (60756):
I have noticed even following behind my team (on the rare occasions I do) that when I enter a room without even casing a nano I will get agro'd and thats with my team beating on the mobs too.  I have tried setting my agro setting at 50% and it still makes no difference.  
So now I keep it at 100%, max evades and run in with the rest of the team. my reasoning is I can keep myself healed while the team kill the mob.  
The thing about team heals is even though they are weaker than the single heal they recycle quicker so thats why you see a lot of docs spamming the team heals.  Myself I alternate, I do a few team heals and a direct and keep that up throughout the fight and it seems to keep everyone alive.  
thats my 2 cents on this subject.. ...but I find getting agro keeps me from getting bored and keeps my interest up a little during endless missions

So there I was in BETA and just cruising around.  I thought Id go back to my apartment.  

So, which one was it?  Look at key  'key to apartment'   thats no help,  why couldnt it say 'Key to apartment in RomeBlue Backyard 2, door 1'

So the search is on,  zone into backyards, check each door,  jump and run out of zone, check next one.  Repeat, and continue.  Well, the worst thing happened next,  I jumped from the wrong point and landed behind the TREATMENT Machine in the back yard.  Then the FEAR sank in, when did I last save?  Oh the horror.  After not being able to get help, termination.

I resolved to turn this in as a bug.  Surely this wasnt meant to be?  Low and behold 1 year 4 months later, You can still find a newbie getting stuck in that same spot.  

Even better, if they havent figured out the Newbie OOC and someone is making another character that already plays, this guy is plain stuck.  He loses hope and logs off.  Delete character and recreates.  No big loss from our stand point, but how many have felt that the 1 or 2 hours it took to end up stuck was more than they could bear?  If they got stuck in the newbie area, how bad could the game be?

This one really shouldn't be hard to reproduce.  I lose about 1 of every 10 missions that I accept.  As someone said, it only seems to happen if you've already got at least one mission.  I'm not sure its because they're too close though.  I've had missions in differing zones bug out on me like this.

Not sure if this is connected (could be), but after you finish a team mission, and leave it, the computer gives you the message that you are in the right zone for a mission and leaves the team mission x on the small map.  Could these phantom left-overs be responsible?

Talk about stirring up profession envy! "Better Program"?! OK, it does add more runspeed, but apart from the fact that both nanos add to runspeed, how can one be better than the other, given the fact that the morph, in addition to adding to runspeed also changes shape, adds to evades, and modifies max health? What does one have to do with the other?! Nice to know that fixers get the "better" program. As if I had any doubt... =/

I came across a nice guy having almost the same problem.  

He would pull a mission for Lush Field.  Walk thru Trade, West Zone, Ferry to Harrys, Upload the Mission, follow the yellow line to Zone into Mutant Domain.  He'd step back and repeat  same result. 

Problem was his mission was in Lush Fields and the Mutant Domain zone cut into his path.


I say this, because if he had held the same direction he was going to start with he would have REZONED into Lush on course.




Im assuming the Living Armor Quest is EXACTLY the same as it was on TEST.   IT took me way out into the DESERT and I found the mission local in a Rhino Camp with a BOSS.   Made a Do or Die run for the Mission Door.

If Im right, you catching the corner of Newlands zone.  Once you have the yellow line, after u zone, maintain the original Direction.  You should zone again and find the Yellow line once again.

Sorry, but that's not the same location that I was having problems with. I know where the rhino boss is, and my quest for the cyber armor was not there. It was in a location on the west side of the zone. 

So west that the zone doesn't extend that far. If you are in Newland, you can see the hole in the ground just to the east. But there's a zone wall before you can get to it. If you are in the desert, you can see the hole in the ground to your west, but there's a zone wall in your way.

Perhaps they finally moved it on test after enough of us petitioned to have us warped to it. lol

Greybear @ 11/3/2002 10:04:42 AM (58774):

Downsizr @ 11/4/2002 9:15:35 AM (And yet another Yalmaha bug ! 65112):
I have three characters that have a Yalm equiped.
Two of them haven't any kind of problem, the last one has a Yalm that is totally fubared.

This last one is my Fixer. I dedicated a lot of time to gather 5+ millions at level 50 to buy a Q35 Yalm in store. And my experience with the Yalm is a nightmare.

Facts :

- Outdoor zone are treated like indoor zones. When I zone with my Yalm equiped, I am out of the Yalm after zoning and the Yalm is still equipped but grey in my HUD.

- At this stage I can put the Yalm from the HUD to my Inventory and re-equip it, but I stay on foot.

- If I put the Yalm in my inventory and zone again, I can put it back in the HUD, get the Yalm morph and fly.

- I can't remove my Yalm if I don't zone. In the same zone, I can remove my Yalm from my HUD, put it in my inventory, and still be morphed in a Yalm and fly around.

- The only part that is working workly is zoning inside missions with my Yalm.

- But exiting mission in Yalm morph has a 50% success. I find myself very often on foot, have to desequip the Yalm outside, find a zone and put back the Yalm.

Problems :

- I can't get out of my Yalm in a zone to make xp at a suitable spot.

- I can't cross zones and still be flying.

- I can get killed in dangerous zones while exiting a finished mission.

What does really bother me :

Getting to a mission is a pain, but I can usually cope with the cumbersome process. My main frustration is that I planned to use my Yalm to accomplish the Fixer's Grid Quest, and the part with the 'great NPC run'. This is absolutly not doable right now withing being killed a dozen times in OT territory.

What I can do :

I petionned and explained these problems. The answer was something like "We are aware of the problem yadiyada". I don't know if the next patch will take care of that problem.
Still, I am ready to assist any dev from FC to study the problem and try any trick. I have already tried many things involving putting the Yalm in bank / bag and zoning / logging.

I am available in the evening GMT+1.

[EDIT]
From 14.6 bugs report :

	
		
			
			
				35) Can't zone with a Yalm anymore... drops to the ground, and the yalm is greyed. [Dhurdahl] - sure I've zoned fine... will check. Dhurdahl - any further info, may be related to wierd screwed up yalms below ql50? ie a ql30 Yalm now has vehicle air requirement of 134 (up from *about* 83 on live) and a ql32 has vehicle air requirement of 55 [Darkbane] Low QL Yalms - FIXED 14.6.0.2 - not sure about Dhurdahl's bug.
			
		
	
The bugged Yalm is Q35, while the other functionnal Yalm are Q40+. Are all the issues described in my post corrected in 14.6 ?

Ok, problem solved, rerolled the quest for the gloves, and got new coodinates in the Rhino Scout Camp (boss camp) in Newland Desert.  Seems the location on the corner of Newland zone is the bugged one, so if you get this, just delete the quest and ask the Good Time Party Mixer again

stormhat @ 11/4/2002 9:33:04 AM (65112):
ok...this is going to sound pretty strange, but try putting your yalm in the bank for a short spell

It worked for me and other of my guildies with the same problem

RVWinkle @ 11/4/2002 9:36:20 AM (65112):
The problem is that it's not accounting for a few points in vehicle air correctly. It determines that your yalm is OE and unequips it so you won't be stuck (fix for another bug I think).

Solution, spend a few more points in vehicle air, less than 5 should do.

Blessed by Spirits shrine gives a +% xp (+81% xp in my case) ... But it's only affecting the xp you get from killing. I tried picking a chest and door while b.b.s. was in effect and got the same xp as normal. Not sure if this is a bug or if it was only supposed to affect xp from killing but thought I'd mention it.

not sure but this might be your problem.... i have an alt that i just bought a Yalm for... i wanted to put the least amount of IP in to Air Veh and still be able to use it... so i would have to buff up everytime to get it on... once in the Yalm i would be fine, till the buffs ran out or i zoned... once they buffs ran out the yalm started doing a lot of wierd things... alot of the problems i had sound like the same problems you have experienced... i fixed it by putting Air veh. up to where it should be to fly the yalm... buffing a yalm on is a bad itea, just send the IP... itll pay off in the long run...

Thx for the support (players support that is).

1) Tried every bank / bag trick with no success.
2) I will use a Air Vehicle implant to go above the requ I need to fly my Yalm. I have them unbuffed, but I am also in full Dillon's armor at the moment, and I guess that some points are added this way.

Stay tuned...

Caol @ 11/4/2002 4:37:58 PM (65112):
Don't bother checking your base skill in vehicle air. It depends on dribble-down.

It simple tho. When you zone, your skill gets calculated without external modifiers causing dribble down. Your armor (or items) add either intellingence or agility.

You will be able to equip it inzone, but when you zone, the check sees you lacking in skill and disables it.

Solution: Take off all your gear with modifiers to Intel or Agility. Up Vehicle Air to the required skill, put stuff back on.

Simple enuff. And I can't believe the GM's didn't inform you of this.

PS. This is the something of the same bug that causes dribble down from Shades of Lubucration to "time out" making engineers loose controll over their pets due to lost Intel dribble-down.

Downsizr @ 11/4/2002 4:47:41 PM (65112):
Caol you are my personnal hero.
Vehicle Air is light green, I'll spend a few more IPs in it without any remorse.

Still have to check the cure though.

Yes, simple, and a bug that has existed for a long time in many other forms.  I still vividly remember the day Whatsamatta put on his Quantum Wings at Harrys, flew east to Pleasant Meadows, and found himself swimming next to a couple of sharks when he zoned.  A few seconds later he was sitting at reclaim, and had lost a huge chunk of xp.  The Neleb's Robe was not factored into a "can fly" check as he zoned.

More recently, Bima had the same problem as Gummi.   One minor piece of gear, Sekutek gloves, was making the difference in that one point of IP to have my Yalm equipped.

I really wish this equipment bug would be fixed.  It is very clear to me that it is a bug, its not as though people throw off all their gear when they zone and then don it all again.

Little Rot @ 11/4/2002 9:38:31 PM (Aimed Shot causes Nano Execution Bug 65306):
Used to notice this quite often on my NT.  Recently I've been playing my doc with an X3 also.  I can not purposly reproduce this but at times if you do an Aimed Shot, you will not be able to cast any nano programs at all.  You will get the feedback text saying that the nano is being executed but nothing happens.  The only way to fix this is to log out, zoning does not help.  Anyone else notice this?  This doesn't seem to happen with any other specials besides aimed shot.

Here's the reverse situation I get when I, as a fixer, team with my adventurer friend:  your adventurer weapon buff is considered a better program.  I don't remember exactly which pair of weapon buffs this was happening with, but the adventurer one was for less damage and more NCU.  I think, but am not positive, it was for less duration too.   It seems to me that every possible way I could think of comparing them, the fixer one was better, but the adventurer one always trumped it when both were executed on me.

Vyker @ 11/4/2002 11:57:15 PM (64372):
There was a thread on this somewhere that had the answer regarding it from FunCom.

Basically it came down to "If X buff takes 10 NCU but gives +20, and Y buff takes 15 NCU but gives +15, Y buff will take precidence since it is considered to be the more powerful nano due to NCU cost"

Buffs that  are in the same Strain, as viewd on jaydes site for example...


Its determined by NCU cost.  Typicaly buffs that  use similar skills  are the same strain.


Another great example of this is the Engie reflect shield, that is a "better" buff that mirrior X, or RRFe despite the fact that it  is only +24(?) reflect.

I had the opposite experience. A couple days ago I went LD in a solo mission. At the time I had a mob rooted and out of range when I went LD. I was afraid by the time I got back in I would be dead because my root would have worn off while I was away.

Instead when I returned the mob was dead. Obviously I never fired a shot. I don't know what happened. I finally concluded Funcom must have prepared for such a situation, automatically killing the mob instead of killing me. Nice touch!

Drabin @ 11/6/2002 5:22:59 PM (Area Changes 65919):
I'm not sure if this has been stated yet but it is confirmed by many people and still resides on Test.

The area change from Rome Green (Southeast) to Rome Red (Southwest) receives "unable to change area" messages after timing out for an extended period and then you get a quick load again and zone over.  This has been like this for months so if you could take a look at that and fix it, I would be very appreciative as many of us spend a lot of time in Rome (due to the nice scenery).

It doesn't happen 100% but does happen about 75% of the time.

iguanoid @ 11/6/2002 6:02:21 PM (64084):
Happened to me yesterday too.  really sux.  And later i went ld in the bossroom, and something much more serious happened....

The team kindly all came down, so i could rejoin the team.  Of course someone was still getting aggro from upstairs, and so eventually we fully disbanded and reformed, went upstairs and killed the boss, and on completion of the mission we got no tokens and no XP reward.

such a commanly known bug as the upstairs aggro, cant heal, cant join team thing really needs to be addressed

Blaik @ 11/6/2002 6:15:49 PM (64084):
I hear ya. About a week ago I went LD just as my team took the button up to the Boss room. I was safe, but I couldn't join the team while they were in a fight with the boss. I helped kill the boss but got no XP (which was about 150k). 

Once the boss was dead the team re-invited me and we all killed the calmed henchmen. I got xp for them and a token. The only thing I really missed out on was the boss. It's unfortunate that I went LD just at that time, but those are the breaks. 

I wish FUNCOM would fix this so when you come back you are still part of the team.

I can't swear to this because I didn't pay specific attention to my nanopool amount before the patch, but I can almost swear that I didnt get the expected increase (or any increase at all for that matter) to nanopool that nanomages were supposed to get. A guild mate did (he is level 193 I'm level 188 - both have similar implants and buffing items equipped). He has close to 7k nanopool now. i still have the same 5.8k.

Can anyone confirm that this has happened to them also?

Calio @ 11/7/2002 1:12:27 AM (bug with stripped implants reverting to having clusters 66202):
I have noticed this for at least the past 2 weeks (in the beginning thought one or two had just been missed) and been trying to figure out what triggers it. still no exact info but I thought I'd post and see what others know.

I sell a lot of QL200 implants and sometimes have clustered implants stripped to resell as empties.  Invariably the pack comes back and all the implants show as being empty basics.  At some later point though, 1 or more will revert to a state where they have clusters in them (I am still not sure if they revert to the original cluster configuration or not).  If you try to strip them again, they often end up being bugged and unstrippable (but not always).  I have only been paying attention since working with 200's, but this may also have been happing with lower QL's.

Zoning does not automatically cause the bugged ones to revert nor does taking them from pack to inventory or from pack to pack, but eventually doing that often enough causes it to happen.

The average rate seems to be about 10% (2 per pack of 21). The guild mate who strips the for me does it in inventroy, not in the pack (I asked), so that isnt a possible source.

Any ideas?

Does the Unique bug apply to every item you have in your bank?

I have (very nearly had, in the past tense) a Blue Bracer of Control - which I only have one of. Yet, when I picked up the bag containing that and two other non-unique items, I got the 'You already have this unique item' message.

The Bracer vanished, fortunately I found it again in another bank slot. 

The rest of my bank wasn't so fortunate, I lost between 3 to 5 bags of armor, weapons, bronto-hide and assorted collectable stuff.

This thread got "Beacon Warped" to the Game-Play bugs forum, I assume by an admin of the bulletin board. So if this is indeed a bug, can I get some feedback from FC on the status of a solution? Such as:

Is this a known bug?Does it affect a lot of people, or just a lucky few?   Is it being worked on?And is there a ETA for a fix?

This is a most aggravating bug as I really need the deflector shields to help against certain types of attacks. Whoa is me.

BTW. anyone else out there experiencing this? Any known work arounds that may resolve it?

FC,  I understand the existence of pesky little bugs that inhabit the software cityscape, especially in software as complex as an online client/server game, and can be patient with such problems. But PLEASE communicate the status of this problem so that we can at least have some expectations, either good or bad.

I mean when you think about it after 12 months you think they would be able release a relatively bug free patch.

We tried to get team missions tonight and couldn't even see our mission icons. One player had to many old missions and couldn't see the icons to delete them.

Hell I know it must be hard to manage this kind of game but I just can’t help but giggle at the lashups they make.

At least this patch has made me laugh a lot which I suppose in a way is what I am paying for, to be entertained.

This one is a pain I think it was to do with the way they tried to fix pet pathing by letting pets warp. I play a fixer and an mp, pet pathing still sucks and pets still get stuck but to add insult to injury now mobs can somtimes warp onto my fixer during a blitz. 

Ouch Ouch get it off me !!!

One of the worst ones i saw was when i was kiting one of the droids in the dogda quest, had a -910 runspeed snare on him and every time the server decided I was too far from him WARP. The snare was still working as once he warped he was back to slow motion. Rather annoying really. :/

Darkbane @ 11/8/2002 6:57:31 PM (58840):
I agree, this began happening at about the same time pets began warping to you, I think I even mentioned it to the BH's at the time. It's still happening atm, more a sort of rubber-band effect where the MOB moves very rapidly to you.

Mercatura @ 11/8/2002 11:00:58 PM (WARNING: Org Channels are never lost 67276):
You can kick people from your guild, but beware.

Once you let someone in your guild, they acquire your guild channel. Then if you kick them some time later (for whatever reason) they can still see your channel on the chat client, and talk on it.

Lessons to be learned:
-No org channel is secure (I'm sure theres a way for people to get to your channel without ever being invited as well)
-Troublesome people can continue to bother your guild, sure you all can ignore them, but everyone has to do it themselves.
-Create/Use some form of a chat bot that works on invite only and can kick/ban people from the channel.

Possible problems:
-It may be possible for people to snoop on bot channels as well, meaning no ingame communication is "safe", except direct tells.
-Any GM/Ark channels may not be safe either! I don't actually know if they have any that they use, but I suspect they do.

Mercatura @ 11/9/2002 5:25:28 PM (67276):
Came across the problem first hand.

Someone ran a bot, it got bugged and started quadruple posting to the org channel (login/logout bot, talk about SPAM) so I kicked it. The owner of the bot was offline for at least the next day or two.

It stayed on the channel for another week and continued to spam spam spam, until the owner finally turned it off. He was also kicked, yet was still able to come and talk on our channel. I warned him to get off the channel.

I have no doubt that the bot and his chars can still read and speak in our org if he wanted to, at least through the chat client. I don't think he "exploited" or did anything different either.

There was a problem reported with vehicles and zoning.  When you zone, the system checks to see if you can equip a vehicle before it adds your bonuses to your stats.  So if you're using implants or buffs to equip the vehicle, you may need to spend some more IP to keep the vehicle equipped when you zone.

Hamr @ 11/9/2002 7:56:12 PM (67557):
nope, got the skill

Peisinoe @ 11/9/2002 8:05:23 PM (67391):
Yes. I zone almost instantly everywhere in the game now except Trade. Start zone. Hear Trade music. Then just black screen for a good 20 seconds before actually entering Trade.

Vydas @ 11/9/2002 8:21:15 PM (67391):
I have this as well.  I am also having the 60 seconds to be able to move (as I now get on logging in) randomly when I zone into Trade.

TygerWulf @ 11/9/2002 9:57:23 PM (Swap Psyche-Trader Nano Line 67612):
The line of Nanos for Traders to 'control' creatures is bugged and/or very badly worded.

First of all the way it's worded makes you think you will *become* (i.e. actually walk around as and 'control' the creature, see through its eyes, etc.) the creature.

Further, the nano is considered a hostile one, so you can't drop it whenever you want.  Using /pet terminate releases the creature, but you're still there concentrating, so you can't do anything.  If your pet dies naturally, you're still concentrating.  Finally, if you are attacked with the effect up, the nano doesn't break the way it's supposed to and you get beaten to a pulp.

This line would really help Traders be able to survive in any kind of combat, and seems like it would make the profession more able to solo, if it worked at all.

Thanks for reading-

Hamr @ 11/9/2002 11:53:46 PM (67557):
Bah, forgot about the damned 2 point bug... have to be 2 points higher than the damned req.

Courtney @ 11/10/2002 5:20:41 AM (dead mobs attacking 67741):
I know something along these lines was addressed... but now you kill a mob in combat and you will be told your not allowed to use specials on it because its dead. Your considered in combat so you cant heal, open chests or such... and the mob seems to ALWAYS hit that last swing even if it misses 3 times before it hits you. and the mob can just sit there for so long tryign to hit you that its annoying to have to wait it out just to heal.  on top of that mobs pets wont consider its masters dead untill its finished that last hit so its master will die.  its very annoying and I would think its just a client server lag issue except seeing "mob misses you, mob misses you, mob misses you, mob hit you for 56 damage, you gained 900 xp" when right before all that you see "Unable to innicate nano program, target is already dead" and you cant stop him from hurting you

Inocybe @ 11/10/2002 6:43:56 AM (Adventurer area calm is bugged 67769):
Friend of the Wild is behaving like an area root rather than area calm. 

Have test casted on various mobs, various levels, outdoors, and I get the following: 

1) cannot sit down to use heal/nano kits
2) continue to receive attack messages as long as I am in the vicinity
3) when the mob has broken through, it retains hate and will come to attack me straightaway

Crain @ 11/10/2002 8:57:10 AM (67741):
Usually when that happens to me, I just sit down.  For some strange reason, the MOB dies when I sit down after I get the "target already dead" or "come back, master" message.  Give it a try.  It works almost all the time for me except for cases when there's lag and the MOB was supposed to hit me.

boovan @ 11/10/2002 1:13:45 PM (67391):
you should have tried Tir yesterday.

Warp to Tir..... 10 minutes.. still loading... kill program.. 20 minutes with loading screen... IN..
move to backyard... stand 20 minutes knocking on door... loading area.. wait 5-10 minutes... IN!

Predicament @ 11/10/2002 8:48:58 PM (PVP and specials 67958):
Well.. now the old horrible special bug that where in camelot before, has spread to other playfields aswell. When the fight moves from a 25% zone, into a higher supression field, one cannot use ones specials anymore. This is not consistent, but very often. Often comes when one runs a little.

"Pvp is not allowed in this area" even if your still fighting and shooting regular shots. This is so annoying. Pls make a fix for it.

Predicament @ 11/10/2002 9:23:07 PM (67958):
The bug with running out of range, and then meeting up again, beeing so bugged that one cannot attack, has become even worse.

Why doesnt this bugs get a really high priority? They have been ingame for ages, and becomes worse it seems. And as the future of AO seem to hold alot of pvp situations, this would ruin all the fun for alot of players. 

I mean, some players are new to pvping and dont understand what happends when they encounter this. Not to wierd tho, alot of things to consentrate about, so i understand they dont quite catch it. This makes them think they suck so much, but their actually only bugged. Making them leave the pvp area.

Is this bugs impossible to fix? If they will never be fixed, its not possible to organize any pvp. Lets say you make a team, and a strategy; Im the tank, and were gonna take out the doc first. Doc runs a little do have some time to debuff us all, when we catch up with him, we cannot attack him. Making some of us have to zone. Breaking all our strategy and half the team gets killed.

This bugs break pvp. One cannot fight organized with this problems existing. Come on, pls adress this. Now is the time to fix it. Before were about to set up towers, etc.

And me zoned 3mins to PW and after zoning i waited 20secs to be able to move. and then i run North maybe 2mins was far away now from zoneplace and then it said :zoning to Pw  entering area and i was standing again at zoneplace. i was teleportet back hehe. nice .

N3XuS @ 11/11/2002 12:55:45 AM (Smugglers :) 68039):
Had a nice night at smuggler's yesterday.
For once I saw mobs killing each other ( a doggy and a smuggler) several times. I don't know, but this can't be the intention right ?
Also for some reason we didn't get the "Somedude looted somexpensivestuff" message. I beleive this was only the case when the inventory was open, not sure though. I don't exactly know what the cause is but I was finally happy with some anti-ninja system and now it seems to be failing... Or is smuggler's just going berserk ?

You also cannot cast roots or snares on them once they move out of 25% even though you're still engaged with them.

Inocybe @ 11/11/2002 9:33:59 AM (67769):
FC, your automated email system doesn't seem to be working. 

I submitted this bug using the feedback form on the main page. There was no auto-responder message.  Which means I don't even know if my bug report ever reached you or not.  

I'm now wondering how many bug reports actually reach you via email.

Snuble @ 11/11/2002 12:53:56 PM (67769):
Send them as PM to Cz

Snuble @ 11/11/2002 12:56:47 PM (67741):
Seen this also. Not like in the old days when they continued to do damage, but its like when specials didn't recycle. Another server/client sync issue. When you sit down you probably do a sync to the server.

Snuble @ 11/11/2002 12:59:19 PM (Mission resets are *back* 68205):
Okay, its been several months since I saw this one last, but yesterday my mission did a reset after I went LD. Please, please, please don't bring back that bug!

Snuble @ 11/11/2002 1:06:03 PM (Damage while zoning, CHANGE! 68207):
Okay, since last patch we take damage while zoning. Thats no good at all. Send the damage server (or damage tread if that s what you use) when you enter the door, not when you enter the new playfield. 

Should your ability to survive a DoT or bad pull be decided on you computers speed? Or how heavily populated/lagged the zone you go into are?

The intention was probably good, but this way of doing it *don't work*.

Change the stop message and freeze dots while zoning.

O'Rourke @ 11/11/2002 2:46:02 PM (63568):
Bump.  Please fix this.

Ashuras @ 11/11/2002 3:13:16 PM (68205):
I don't think it's just a simple LD.

I think the mission server crashed... and u get disconnected as a result.

Somehting must have messed up their server code and cause it to become unstable..

I tried /terminate while in the Grid (don't ask), and I got the message that I died of self-termination damage, but the server did not send me to a reclaim terminal. I actually had to grid out and /terminate again to get this to work properly.

Wenlo @ 11/11/2002 5:11:28 PM (Mobs attacking each other instead of the player 68276):
I (level 60 engineer) accepted a 'find-the-item' mission at the Avalon mission terminal next to the bank.
The mission is in Meetmedere.
I zoned into the entrance room and peeked into the first room: mission is of the type having a large, tall central room with posters on the walls. This central room contained three green engineer mobs.
I attempted to pull one engineer into the entrance room: all three noticed me, cast their pets, and followed me back to the entrance room, where they proceeded to pummel me.
Please note that three mobs with three pets is extremely  challenging. I could not kill even one engineer, as I was forced to zone out and heal several times.
Out of desperation I re-entered the mission and bolted past the six mobs into the central room. I turned to see how many followed me, but instead saw multiple messages about "engineer attacks engineer for xxx points", and similar messages about bots attacking bots (alas, I did not think to capture any logs). After the messages stopped, I re-entered the entrance room to see three dead engineers, two dead pets, and one damaged bot standing there.

I'm assuming this is a bug. If it's a feature, however, I love it

DaveDread @ 11/11/2002 5:13:25 PM (68274):
Seems like all indoors NPC's have gone on an extended coffee break.

MP, Agent and Adv NPC's are still there (checked myself) and they are outdoors. MA quest NPC (indoors) have been missing since 14.6 and I know other professions that are missing them as well. I talked to a GM who said he would check it asap, so FC should be aware of it.

O'Rourke @ 11/11/2002 5:43:59 PM (68236):
If I recall correctly, Brenda Diamond was pretty chatty when I did the quest.  I think this is intended.

anyone else noticed this?

Intrepid @ 11/11/2002 7:26:02 PM (Crat speeches 68351):
Seems the crat speeches which adds to off and def are bugged,  Not sure whether they are actually bugged or just visually bugged.

But my attack rating is increased twice what the nano says it is.

For example

heroic measures increases my attack rating by 200 points when it says it should only increase it 100.  Don;t know if the def rating is increase double as well.

Also checked with Glorious Leader and it is bugged in the same way.  Increasing attack rating 130 instead of 65.  Once again unsure if this actually affects the damage we are doing or is just a visual bug.

Sabyan222 @ 11/11/2002 7:50:02 PM (68274):
thx for replying man

(not too hopeful however)

zeroframerate @ 11/11/2002 9:43:32 PM (68276):
Absolutely!  I love it too!  I hope they don't fix this.  Maybe the engie's got droid envy and started attacking each other to prove which droid was the best.

Bjorn @ 11/11/2002 10:06:41 PM (68341):
noticed it first time i put on my manex. dont have so it shows misses so dunno if its so every time it reloads... far too low RI to be sure :P

Keldros @ 11/12/2002 1:19:35 AM (Says I don't have line of sight for nano, but I'm in the mob's melee range 68482):
This killed me three times in one mission last week, after the 14.6.1 patch was installed.

A mob is hitting me for melee damage, and if I try to cast any offensive nano I'm told I don't have line of sight on the target.  The worst part is, the mob is right next to me--not behind a table or rock.

Uberling @ 11/12/2002 1:47:27 AM (67391):
bump.
It takes damn long time to zone to Trade and move there, now.

Pluteaux @ 11/12/2002 1:53:28 AM (Disappearing Boss Mob in Mission 68495):
I've been soloing team missions. The last one I did, I killed about 15% of the mobs before heading to the boss room. The boss was a little too tough, so I left that level and killed a bunch more mobs, leveling twice in the process. After having killed about 85% of the mobs, I was low on ammo, so I left the mission to resupply. When I got back to the mission, I killed the rest of the mobs before heading back to the boss room. When I got there he was gone. I still had 4 hours remaining to complete the mission. I picked up the object in the boss room and got my token and reward items.

Three missions ago, I killed all the mobs and then headed for the boss room. He caught me by surprise hitting me with a nano that did over 200 damage (I was lvl 22 with less than 600 max health), killing me. After reclaiming my stuff and getting over rez shock, I went back to the mission. Again, no boss in the boss room. Time was still left to complete the mission, which I did, getting my reward.

The only reason I did these team missions was for the boss loot. I'm very disappointed the boss mobs were gone both times I returned to the boss room.

Uberling @ 11/12/2002 1:55:03 AM (67612):
Yeah, it will be funny if FC fix this completely useless, as it is now, line. 3, 7, 14 minutes of complete stuck... what body part they did use to think when create these nanos?

Uberling @ 11/12/2002 1:59:19 AM (68276):
SHHHHHH!!!!!! Don't let FC know about it!

Uberling @ 11/12/2002 2:05:48 AM (58840):
bump.
When i attack swimming mobs (not fishes), they teleports right to me, no matter how far they was swim. It isn't VERY annoying, i just don't like this kind of ****.

Uberling @ 11/12/2002 2:18:17 AM (52790):
It was announced like boss ability, so it isn't bug, but it have few issues and MUST BE FIXED.
1. Range. Warping back half zone away?
2. Target. It warps anything what was around no matter who start fight, i was warped half zone back just because did fly (just fly, didn't peek) over someone fighting boss.
3. Finally, ****** realization of ability. When you warped, boss, in real, stops attack you, it's ok, but you also STOPS attack him and need manually start fight again.

street @ 11/12/2002 5:54:44 AM (67490):
i see this bug whenever i am sitting and do something that requires an "action", such as touching reclaim, or executing a treatment. you just get stuck standing there until you, um, stand for real. it has been consistent since the patch.

the good news is that i don't glide as much!

-street-

Shadelore @ 11/12/2002 7:39:07 AM (68276):
It happens if u get say 1 omni and 1 clan mob in same mission, say if its a neutral team. This have been around for ages I think, dont happen so often tho, but its fun =)

Lillatjosan @ 11/12/2002 10:02:35 AM (58840):
Well as for everyone this happend to me to. but also in reverse mode. when i was running i got some funny teleportation right back into all the mobs and there i died !  i sugest FC removes the aka mortal combat scorpion GET OVER HERE style in theire game !

Keaorata @ 11/12/2002 12:33:52 PM (67769):
Bump for this.

Area calm doesnt work.

As Ino said, it works as an area root rather than a calm. The mobs are rooted in place but still attack if you get close.

Obviously with ya still considered as having aggro ya cant sit to use kits etc.

Needs fixing. A calm that doesnt calm isnt a calm, so i consider that a major bug

Snuble @ 11/12/2002 12:45:49 PM (67769):
Okay, lets give everything a try after this wednesday emergency patch (just hope they don't break anything this time), then I'm going to start a new tread compiling a list of stuff that affects adventurer gameplay (in the adventurer forum that is), using darkbanes test bug tread as a template. Screw waiting for FC to bring back the professional program, lets start our own!

Walking around in the Subway I noticed that you get the xp a little bit before the creeps are dead. If someone were very crafty, I imagine this could be used as an exploit. :O

Thanks!

Bima @ 11/12/2002 6:25:50 PM (68276):
It isn't just missions with a Clan versus OT, it will happen even between mobs of the same faction.  As the first post said, it happened in his case with the three engie mobs in the first room, who would have all been the same faction.

Pluteaux @ 11/12/2002 6:49:44 PM (68495):
Just happened for the third time in four missions. I got one person to team with me. I picked a team mission. I left team. Went in mission. Fought boss mob in boss room and was killed. Came back to mission, and no boss in boss room. My mission has 3 hours left for me to complete it.

Could this be because I left the team? Maybe next time I should ask the other team member to leave the team.

This "bug" seems to be repeatable. I think it may be occurring because I left the team (before entering mission), entered the mission (the boss was there), and then left the mission. Since I had the mission key, I could come back in. Question is, did the boss disappear when I left the mission (twice due to dying and once to resupply) or when I re-entered?

Each time I was able to complete the mission after the boss disappeared and get the mission token and rewards. What I wanted, of course, was to kill the boss and get the boss loot.

Shadowspawn @ 11/12/2002 8:41:09 PM (63568):
Bump. Any word on 14.6.1?

Wenlo @ 11/12/2002 9:27:00 PM (68205):
I had a mission with three mobs in one room- I killed one, and the other finished me off. When I returned, there were again three mobs in the room.

Is this the same type of situation you are referring to?

Uberling @ 11/13/2002 1:51:22 AM (67741):
Happens to teammate when we did team mission in BS. We kill mob, got our exp and oops... last swing and my teammate dead and losing all exp including exp for that already killed mob.

brad22 @ 11/13/2002 7:04:46 AM (63568):
Please, I agree it's extremely annoying in the middle of a fight for your ncu buff to wear off and you not be able to cast a healing nano or the like...... Please Please Please Fix this.....

brad22 @ 11/13/2002 7:12:42 AM (No exp for killing enginer and meta-phy  pets 69005):
In several missions since the last patch I have encountered engineers and meta-phys that spawn there pets of course they were orange mobs and there red spawns (That Funcom fixed!!!) werent a problem. But when I killed the mob and there pet was still attacking me.  I get mob exp but when I kill the pet there is no exp rewarded and no loot at all.... Can this bug be fixed?
Loot no problem the the red pet should give me some exp at the very least.....

brad22 @ 11/13/2002 7:17:52 AM (58840):
I am a Fixer with over 400 runspeed I assume that in game terms that's about 400 steps per min or something like that or maybe meters, Anyway, If my attack range is only about 15-20 meters with a Kerans then how can a mob with melee damage keep hitting me when i'm running like a bat from hell away from it???
I can't attack it till it get's close to me, but it still does damage while its running to me and while i'm running away?????

Xhardoc @ 11/13/2002 7:19:51 AM (Token bugs? 69007):
I hear everyone saying tokens are worth more at higher levels.. but MINE ARE BUSTED. Today I tested it out.

Right click on board:
You have 139 tokens.

Right click token from bank:
You have 140 tokens.

I am LEVEL 81 here. Souldn't I be getting 4???

I wonder if it's because I created my char last year? (Aug 2001)?

Also today, team mission, everyone completed it, got token, but  didn't get one. Second time this happened to me (not in a row tho).

What is up with that? =/

brad22 @ 11/13/2002 7:20:06 AM (67490):
I've experienced this bug too. Will be standing but actually sitting...

Katerchen @ 11/13/2002 10:16:14 AM (68495):
This sounds familiar to me.

Recently a boss walked into the walls and ca back swimming on the floor, then he disappeared for a while.
Just when we decided to take the item and finish the mission the boss reappeared, swimming thru the ceiling.

Finally someone managed to hit and aggro the boss, so that we could kill him.

Probably the boss was only swimming around in the walls...

If you don't believe me, I took screenies...

Katerchen

Katerchen @ 11/13/2002 10:23:20 AM (67490):
Interesting...

I again experience this bug different...
When I sit down it often looks like standing up and vice versa

The sit/stand stuff seems totally out of synch now :/

Yup
The line-of-sight algorithms got even more bugged. You have to run around and let the mob hit you until you find a strange position where the program considers the mob "in range".

A minimal height difference will regularly mess up Funcoms Line-of-sight algorithms. 

Fix this, I might resubscribe if you do it before I will finally lost interest in AO

I sometimes also noticed loss of experience when starting new missions, even if i am religiously with saving immediately after returning from the last mission. I always wondered because I was sure that i saved before there, but in dubio errare humanum est.

But this thread makes clear to me that I was remembering correct, and that is yet another bug.

I am used to fly to the save terminals in a yalm and clicking them quickly so that i get the save message and then immediately flying back.

So it indeed could be a desynch issue.

I live in Europe and the "European" server is in USA...   in peak times I need up to several minutes for zoning due to packet loss...  so it is no fun to regularly die when I would have to leave the first mission room for healing...

Think about it, Funcom

OK, you've been stung attempting to use an exploit so really no sympathy.

So, to the two specific issues you mentioned:

1. Are you sure these were not Bravery tokens?
Bravery tokens collected from Mobs and during some quests (like Dodga) are only worth one token no matter what your level is, so there is certainly no point even attempting to save these.

2. If you've got tokens in the bank then you already own the unique item.
So, when you finished your team mission teh server knew you already had the unique item and wouldn't allow you to own another one.
Harsh I know and actually not documented, however it has happened to a few people, you will need to empty your bank of tokens before you get some more.

Looks like Funcom have attempted to close up this exploit with 14.6 so my hats off to them.

Snuble @ 11/13/2002 12:40:58 PM (68205):
Nope. Not unless the mission server did a reset while you where rezzing.

Will probably be better today as they do a server patch.

Xhardoc @ 11/13/2002 2:03:19 PM (69007):
Fine .. exploit you say. Someone told me like a week ago about saving tokens for later. I only have like 6 in the bank at this point.

I do know that my entire career I have NEVER gotten more than 1 point for a token. I remember specifically because I counted my way up to 120. By ONES. I soloed missions in complete trying to get there. 

Regardless of saving tokens, something is obviously wrong.

Xhardoc @ 11/13/2002 2:06:54 PM (69007):
Oh and I can only recall getting maybe two bravery tokens. (Killed a mob and looted it off). But 99% of my tokens were from doing team missions and soloing. Lots of soloing. 

Being a Doctor and basically not having a great soloing class (especially since I tuned myself for healing at this point) It's gonna be hard to get to my 1k board incrementing by ones...

RedSonja @ 11/13/2002 3:53:00 PM (69007):
Why don't you clear all the tokens out of your bank and upload them.
Then go and do either a solo or team mission and get a brand new token and see how many that is worth?

As to the question of exploit, lets see.
Do easier low level missions for token reward, save them in the bank and eventually in theory they could be worth more than twice as many tokens when you upload.
I'd say that comes under the term exploit.

If you have never ever received more than 1 token when uploading a mission token then I'd say you need to get a GM to take a look.
The 1000 board is a piece of cake for anybody now, even if it takes you until you are Level 150+
It is just a case of "when you get it" no longer "If".

Not a big issue whatsoever by any stretch of the imagination, but something that has irked me since day 1 of beta.

Every time you enter into the shop the Miir person there just says "I don't know what you're talking about."  You don't have to say anything at all to him.  Can we have him work rightly?

Secondly, the lighting in Miir stores is, frankly, crap.  It needs to be brighter and more vibrant.  I dunno how Miir gets away with charging that much cred for some flimsy piece of clothing and still not afford good lighting.

Wow.  Wish I had thought of that.   But I honestly had no idea you get more token worth for your token depending on your level when you upload it.  I thought it was just one-for-one all along.

Xhardoc @ 11/13/2002 5:12:47 PM (69007):
Wonder if i had to do with the server patch.. but now I am getting 4 as I am supposed to ...

As far as expliot is concerned I think that's debatable. In some cases, people are living without the merit bonus so that they can get their 1k board easier. 

If it was such a big deal, Funcom would make tokens be useable within a certain level range. If they can do morphing memory and living armor, they can certainly tag a token so it has to be useable within 5 levels of someone receiving it.

Their other option is to make them non-bankable.

Wenlo @ 11/13/2002 5:32:37 PM (69005):
This is intentional. Since pet-owner mobs can chain-cast pets, it would possible to ignore the pet's owner and kill pets over and over for XP.
Yes, I agree we should get XP for killing red pets (otherwise where's the reward for the risk?) and IMHO the pet-owner mobs should only cast one pet, ever, to avoid exploits.

Herodotus2 @ 11/13/2002 6:00:26 PM (Bug with Dualling Mantis Scissors 69234):
Anyone else noticed this ? 

I was experimenting last night with various 1h-edged combo's. for PvP and at one point tried dualling Mantis Scissors, and I noticed something very odd. 

NO dimach and NO brawl. It's like my specials were un-available, even said so in the chat client, but the icon's were showing available. At first I thought it might be a Playfield / Zone problem, so I zoned, tried it on the outdoor mobs / guards, same problem so I zoned again. This time to a completely different part of Rubi-Ka. Same problem. All this time 20 mins had passed, plenty of time for a Brawl special to recycle, and still no joy. 

Anyone else noticed this. In the end I ended up dualling SOL Type F and Mantis and my Special's returned.

Is this a deliberate function of dualling Mantis Scissors or a bug ? 

Some info. for you.

Im a 177 'trox ADV. Not sure if it's breed / profession specific, i.e. problems with the 'trox template ? 

Anyway I'd be interested for some feedback on this from other players and any game devs. reading this. 

P.S. Hope you game dev's. are enjoying the snow out there in DK, looks like fun... and the guy in the shorts.... one word... insane !!!

Herodotus2 @ 11/13/2002 6:04:51 PM (67490):
Yup me too.... 

Most noticeablly when Im re-charging Nano / Health. Ill sit to charge then instantly stand without hitting [X] to stand. 

In missions this is a little confusing as Ill hit [X] - sit - recharge, think Im standing, so hit [X] again, and then stand. My poor little [X] key is getting worn out.

When I reload my weapon manualy, I get the message that it's loading. Just to make sure, I reload again and get the "Already loaded" message. Now I fire off a Full Auto and occasionally I get a hit with x bullets (x = varies from 0 bullets to 5 or 6) then I get another reloading message. Clip size is 20, so even with a 13 or more bullet hit I should still have enough to fire a burst also. I've noticed this several times and wanted to see if anyone else has noticed this problem with the boosted hellspinner or any other weapon.

zeroframerate @ 11/13/2002 10:18:08 PM (69007):
I'd actually like confirmation that this is indeed considered an exploit by someone official because it honestly sounds like a viable method of token usage/gathering.

Vyker @ 11/14/2002 12:51:27 AM (69007):
It's an exploit...

After coming back to AO from an extended break I still had a pack of tokens in my bank (if you played a long time ago we used to hoard them and trade them to other folks) but they took that away so I just had this pack sitting there. 

Well.... I find out that now my tokens that were worth 1 token originally were now worth a lot more!  Much to my excitement and amazement. 

So I figured heck I'll just go and add more tokens to new packs and stuff them in the bank too for later on.  Only used enough tokens to upgrade my board to my current usable title level at the time. 

Problem I ran into was I couldn't put more the one in a pack... hrm that's odd... /petition I can't put more then one token in a pack now what's up?

Response: usuall blah blah erm... I think a GM should discuss this with you one moment please. 

GM:  Well since you didn't know any better (Translation: your a dipwad and I can't belive you actually petition this) I won't ban you at this time, but I will require you to use all of your stored tokens immediately or they will be deleted.

Long story short.... it's a ban offense to store tokens for later use.  Not that you can now but you could.

Xhardoc @ 11/14/2002 5:00:39 AM (69007):
Funcom should make a point to post news or some kind of notice about it. Or fix it in game to prevent it. It's pretty wide spread... I have since used all my tokens now that I realize they are worth 4 as they are intended, before I thought it was under 100 = 1 token = 1, after 100 = 1 token  = 4.  Because seriously before I was getting one all the time. Oh well.

But they should make it clear because many players are telling everyone to do it, and the majority of us don't even think of what's expliot until we have these discussions.

Pluteaux @ 11/14/2002 5:25:43 AM (68495):
This is a repeatable bug. Just completed another mission in which the boss mob dissappeared before the time to complete the mission was up.

I asked a person if I could temporarily team with her to pick myself a team mission. I thought the problem might be that I was leaving the team after choosing the team mission, so this time I let the other person leave the team. I then went to the mission, killed all the mobs except the boss mob, left the mission, came back with 3 hours remaining to complete the mission, and the boss mob was gone. I picked up the object to find and got my token and mission rewards.

This has now happened in 4 of the last 5 team missions I've soloed.

Is this how it's supposed to work? If the entire team (just one in my case) leaves the team mission and then re-enters, the boss mob disappears? Seems like an easy way to get rid of the boss mob if you don't want to fight him.

Avedis @ 11/14/2002 2:48:44 PM (69005):
Having no reward is bogus. Even if you're careful about deliberately targetting the owner only, in big fights things get confused and a player might auto-counterattack to a pet's attack, then you have to take it out.

Ever since the patch, I've had freezing problems when using elevator buttons in missions.

I think this is a client and server synch issue, but please fix it.

In every other team mission when I use the elevator button everything freezes up for 30 seconds. I can't move or click anything. My team members and mobs do not show up on the map either.

Unfortunately, if I'm the first one to go up and this happens.. I usually get frozen for 30 seconds, then get spammed with a dozen hit messages from whatever mob is in the room before I'm sent to a reclaim term..

That reclaim term owes me a couple million exp this week..

Just wanted to spread the word.

Hornsbuck @ 11/15/2002 6:22:28 AM (Yalm bug while rezzing... >_<; 69865):
Well, this latest patch has affected our Yalmahas in several good and several bad ways. Please feel free to add any I might have missed.

Good:

Since our flight skill isn't nerfed anymore while rezzing we can now get into our Yalms without waiting around after we reclaim our items.
If we die in a mission while we still have our Yalms equipped (greyed out) we reappear at the reclaim terminal already in flight. Very cool.


Bad:

If the yalm is equipped during rez, you can't disembark properly. There has been numerous times where I'd die in a mission or dynacamp out in PW, rez in Hope, grab my stuff, fly back and find I cannot get out of my yalm. The item disequips and is viewable in my inventory, but my form doesn't change until I zone (in some cases, this can take a few minutes as I have to find a door to go in or fly to another zone).

Workaround:

Do not get into your Yalm until you get the text confirmation that your rez shock is over. THEN get into your Yalm.

Are there any plans to fix this? I really like the flexibility of being able to fly while rezzing as it speeds things up considerably, but when you have to fly back from BFE just to get out of the thing is pretty inrritating. If there a middle ground?

Hornsbuck @ 11/15/2002 6:30:19 AM (Sitting/Standing visual bug with item use. 69866):
Another nasty graphic bug that has popped up with this last patch are the sitting/standing animations. Whenever you are sitting to use a treatment kit or stim, the sitting usage animation is GONE, replaced with the standing item usage animation. This in turn leaves you in a standing position when you're still sitting.

Workaround:
Hit X again to reset the animation and stand (you'll go from a standing pose to an immediate sit then stand). This has lead to alot of messy healing in the thick of battle. This wasn't broken before 14.6, so please fix it. Its confusing and just makes the game look cheap and sloppy.

Mercatura @ 11/15/2002 10:09:41 AM (63568):
Hud2, my bad. Doesn't block scopes then 

Ignoring IP costs, fixer nano caps with the interface are the same as:

MM - Green
BM - Light Blue
PM - Green
MC - Light Blue
TS - Light Blue
SI - Green

The way title caps work, its actually slightly better than those colors during title3/4/5 when already capped.

It makes life harder when leveling, but after title5 when you can really afford your nanos, fixers are sitting pretty so to speak. Given that FC said no more color changes "ever", they probably ended up with the best solution. (theres no way they would have given fixers a way to get more MC PM and SI than NTs, and they never lower reqs on anything it seems)

FYI, FC set skill colors deceptively, cyan has 2 possible caps and dark blue has three, four if you count NTs.

PS the sooner they fix the ncu rebuffing crap, the better.

Dyna18 @ 11/15/2002 2:09:44 PM (Serious Bug: Bank being scrambled 69957):
With yesterday's patch I was hoping that this serious issue would be fixed, but it still isn't 

I've petitioned about it, wrote an e-mail and written about it on the tempory patch forum, but no reply from FC so far 

The current unique handling is a mess. If I take a bag out of the bank that contains an unique item, all those unqiue items are dropped from the bag. This even happens if I don't even have those unique items in my inv or wear them. They just are dropped from the bag no matter what.

To make things worse, is that this also scrambles your entire bank content.

I'm a trader, but currently I can't do my job, because I can't find anything anymore in my bank 
I've talked to guild mates who happened exactly the same. And if you look around the forum you would read that people are now even afraid to use their banks!!!!

So how serious do you want a bug to be before it's fixed that people are even afraid of it?

Either fix this poor unique messing around, or roll back the unique changes made in the patch, because I want to trade again and access my bank without fear of losing things!

I dont have much health, I know that. Im a crat, see - so I guess Im no good tank. But sometimes I need to take a couple of hits - to get thier attention or when I screw up in general.

I have 1.4k health. So why do I die when I get 2 hits - all together 300?

Ill tell you why, because thats how they (funcom) make money, apparently. 

If you cant make the game challenging enough, you fix it with bugs? How low of an attitude is that anyway?

It seems now that when you set off a bomb in a chest it wacks you twice, the first hit is alot higher then it used to be and then the second hit which is new hits for about 1/4 of the damage of the first hit. Both are area damage hits can't remember if they always where or not.

You can upgrade to the 250 board anytime in title level 3 (so from level 50 to level 99) or above.  Assuming you did upgrade the board, you might want to petition in game, as it does sound like it's a legitimate issue.  If you haven't upgraded the board, yet, 'use' it (make sure you have a top inventory slot open), and then wear it again.

There is a common server/client lag bug that causes your health to display higher then it is. the easyway to verify your are at your correct health is to either sit and heal after every fight or target your self.

Point blank you were almost dead but the client side didn't know that.

Well, you do have to wear it.  When I upgrade mine, I just 'click' on it to 'use' it, and it moves from my neck to the inventory.  Then I put it back on, and get the bonuses.

If yours isn't working (and one of my characters just upgraded within the last day or so), your character probably needs to be examined, as I think (I'm sorry to say), it might be something with the character itself.

The board will show the right number of 'symbols', even when not worn.

Wraith God @ 11/16/2002 2:12:53 AM (69212):
I totally agree. The lighting in Miir's is more suitable for a night club than a clothing store. If you buy anything you've got to go outside to see it.

Another big complaint about Miir's is that you can't try things on. Buy-to-try is their only policy. More often than not, the item looks way different when you put it on than you'd think by looking at it in the shop. Thankfully, I've already bought just about everything in there so I know what it really looks like, and my alts don't have to waste their money. Earlier on though, I threw more stuff out than I kept.

A note for dumb programmers: The lighting needs to be fixed before the try-on feature would be of any use.

Pluteaux @ 11/16/2002 5:25:39 AM (68495):
Up until now, as long as I didn't leave the team mission I was soloing, the boss mob wouldn't disappear, and, if I killed him, I would get the boss loot. This time, after I killed the boss and right clicked his corpse, his pack popped up and I could see all the items, but the pack immediately and automatically closed. I right click the corpse again, the pack again briefly shows it's contents and closes, and then the corpse dissappears. I wasn't able to loot it. There were hours left to complete the mission. I picked up the item to complete the mission just before trying to loot the boss and got my item rewards.

I'm lvl 43 and just killed the boss mob by myself in a lvl 55 or 56 mission and I get no boss loot? Is this the way it's supposed to work if you solo a team mission?

The previous times, when I left the mission and came back in, there was no longer any boss to even fight. Is this the way it's supposed to work? Does FC not want people to solo team missions? There's lots and lots of good stuff you can only get through team missions. Am I doing something wrong or illegal? Somebody answer me, please.

Me as well.  I'm not entirely positive but it only seems to happen the very first time that I go from the first level to the second level, and not for any subsequent level changes, even subsequent first level to second level changes.

Bima @ 11/16/2002 6:22:46 PM (68495):
We had a different kind of disappearing boss that was frustrating.  For some reason one of the minions started attacking the boss, and fought it while we did.  Because of an old fix for an exploit where people would drag unique mobs to guards so they could loot them when dead, we ended up with no XP for our efforts and no boss loot at all.  Very frustrating.  Left us feeling very ripped off.

I wish I knew why the minion did that.  Might have been an AoE from an NT boss, but I can't remember the boss type.  Then again, I've seen same-sided mobs fight each other in missions even when I'm sure no NT was around.

Sethil @ 11/16/2002 11:36:33 PM (69302):
If you fire a FA, you shoot the whole clip empty, but you hit only with x bullets. Then you get a reloading message..... you cant burst before this message appears. Thats normal with every FA gun. But I would recommend to 1. Burst, 2. FA

twice today i calmed a mob and crashed shortly thereafter.

when i logged back in i found myself lying on the floor with the calmed mob raping me.

if this is a lag issue please explain to me how a mob that on my client is shown to go out of combat stance after my message of successfall spell completion flashes by can stop shooting and resume it as soon as my char goes ld???

on a side note i also lost the mission reward because i completed, crashed and did not receive anything on return.

this is extremely painfull for me since the only joy i have left in ao is playing around with unusual alts and i am forced to equip them purely by calming through missions with my bureaucrat because the ingame shops are not worth 1 credit.

as a calmer i live with the sync bug, the usefullness of pets, the redundancy in higher levels because of broken risk reward and with boss mobs immune to everything i do.

i think its enough so please get this crap fixed!

Old bug, I know.
But it's still present.

When trading with other people, sometimes, the item or money won't appear on one side (usually the one getting the item, not hte one giving it away).

Most of us know that zoning will solve that. Accept trade, zone, and the item/money will appear. No big deal. But annoying. Especially when you're giving clusters to other people for them to combine, and thus forcing them to zone, just to do me a favour.

There, I said it.  I feel abit better now.

Question: Is this a bug with this weapon only or all weapons ?

ok , just saw a similar report of a boosted hellspinner cannon ( same weapon) with a similar problem. About 10 threads down.
Although it was somewhat confusing as I think the answer was a misinterpretation of what was being asked.

The outdoor ones (Susan Furor, Elmer Raag etc) are still alive and kicking, but the indoor ones (MA, Soldier, NT personally confirmed) went away in 14.6 patch-the-patch patch.  

fixer quest NPC's seem to be around, so it seems isolated to the profession ring NPC's.

Inyuendo @ 11/18/2002 2:40:18 AM (68257):
Well, actually, when I /terminate'd, I heard my character's death sound, and all my skills were red, and I was moving real slow, so basically I had the rez shock and all. I was under level 20 at the time so I didn't lose exp. So by all intents and purposes, I was dead.

I guess my point is that all indicators pointed to my being dead, but I didn't respawn properly, i.e., at a reclaim. 

So maybe it's not a bug, but at the very least it's an inconsistency.

Noticed something similar to this also.  One team member went outside and afk to grab a bite to eat and the pullers kept on a pullin'...  The percentages changed as soon as the afk teammember came back.

Lesson?  Near as I can figure the lesson is to just wait for the other team members to all be assembled and ready to go.  Not waiting screws up your token percentages and could possibly keep the team from getting tokens at the end.

Yesterday one of the most crasiest bug I have seen so far. I was going from shop to shop, and I was in Athen. I entered one of the special clan supermarket, and I ended in a empty house. When going out of the house I faced an omni guard! I was in East plains, in the SE corner of the RubiKa map!!!!
Since I have never been there I quickly died, due to bad encounters. Hoppefully I did not loose that much exp, since I saved before.
BUT what a damn bug!?
My conclusion is, always save before shopping... you never know what can happen...

tojo69 @ 11/19/2002 1:11:20 PM (67741):
I'va actually died from this - fighting with two agents, being ransacked, and rendered unable to heal, hoping that I would survive just long enough to kill them both.

Well one went down (as did my HP's) and the last one went down in the same paste as myself so I had hope (Dimach). 
I was down to the last breath as was he, hit "k" and he died.

He was still standing though, and I tried Brawl, Special, Grenade, and NOTHINg happened, just the message that he already was dead.

Then a last shot from that him killed me, Lost the XP, and was sent to the reclaim  - VERY funny *not*

After this I RUN away from them after having killed them, in the hope that they wont kill me from beyond the grave

I had a friendly doctor try to combine a QL58 shining cluster of nano regeneration with a QL62 Right Wrist, but was told they did not combine.

If I try to combine them, I am told I need at least 325 in Pharmaceuticals, so obviously it should be possible to combine them.

Looks like one for the Funcom Debug Department.

Hypos @ 11/20/2002 5:20:47 AM (71553):
There are several known problems with the nano regen clusters.  Sometimes when you combine them, you get other items like weapons or armor.

I made a full set for myself.  It works fine as long as the first cluster to go into the implant is the nano regen cluster.  If you try to put one into an implant that already has one or more clusters, then it may or may not work.

Pluteaux @ 11/20/2002 7:41:59 AM (68495):
This is continuing to happen. The last time, AFTER killing all the mobs in the mission, the person I was teamed with had to leave and quit our 2-person team. I apparently killed the boss mob on the last hit before taking the elevator (We were both very close to dying when I left the boss room). After healing I took the elevator back to the boss room, and he was not there--no corpse and no living boss, so I didn't get the boss mob loot. I then picked up the item to complete the mission and get my token and 2 mission rewards. Am I going to get an explanation of this? At least acknowledgement that it is a known bug? This is very, very easy to verify if you read my posts. Is anyone form FC reading this? Hello?

Yeah, This is one of them really annoying visual bugs, like the mini yalm thing.  I hope this one can get fixed soon.


From my experiences it is al a code issue of potentioly a missing command to 'reset' the animation after you use and item/cast a nano/etc and sit(or are sitting).  If the server/client would do some sort of check to see what state your suposed to be in after using a nano it might help.


I am guessing that this is a result of fixing the 3rd person bugs that we were seeing on test before this patch went live (Trust me they were much worse)

Recently I have had this problem with chat and in game text (mission, itam, character references).  I can't see any text, only a block of colour.  I've spoken to various people and I've tried to reinstall my graphic drivers just in case.
However, the problem is still persisting.  What other options do I have?  At present, I can't speak or read in the game:" I'm effectively deaf and mute.

Snee @ 11/21/2002 10:52:07 AM (14.6 - Shots going "Blackhole" 72120):
After 14.6 patch came live Ive been bugged in every mission Ive been in.

When attacking a mob I will often have the first and second shot "blackhole". Sometimes one of these shots might come with the third shot I fire sometimes not. This blackholing can happen in the middle of a fight too. In a good team you might get 5 - 6 shots in per mob, and therefor I might lose up to 30% of my attacks. Whether or not these shots still go through even though I dont see it Im not sure of. I can atleast not see the mobs health go down. Theres is not message saying its a miss, and Im sure thats not the problem either as I wouldnt miss my first shots that often.

Another problem is that If I do get my first shot in on a mob and this shot is a crit, the damage will sometimes only do about 60% of what I normally crit for.

Ive heard rumours that Notum Wars Beta might be the cause of all the issues today. Hope you can clarify my problems ..

Lemain @ 11/21/2002 11:43:59 AM (again: Ghost damage 72131):
Hi!

I've read the board and found an entry of August concerning the so called "ghost damage". Nothing seems to have changed since then.
My point of view:

Things don't get easier. Yesterday I finally hit lvl 100 with my MA. Compared to others, I am still a "poor" guy; I have no yalm and it is always hard to afford new imps, ncu and stuff like that.

Now, solo missions lead more and more to areas, where it is hardly possible, to survive the long run. If I finally find one (near Bliss or in Avalon e.g.), the mission item is mostly crap. So far, so bad, but after 10 minutes and a fortune of spent credits I mostly find something, which is worth the trouble.

Now, as I said, things are getting tough and tougher. Even in a solo mission (difficulty slider untouched in the middle) one can encounter hard to kill mobs. So some tactics are necessary. To make it short: I have my tactic to go through those dungeons, but very often this happens: I hit a  mob and run towards the exit room (to zone out, if it is too hard). On the map I see the mob far behind in another room. Nevertheless, he keeps hitting me. I understand, that this might be a server/client issue, but to know this, doesn't make things better. 
Ok, I run and arrive at the exit room with 3/4 of my health. Mob arrives, hard fight, I win. I sit down to heal and get the message, that I am still in a fight. And suddenly the chat window becomes red with "you were hit ....." messages. Who hits me? I don't know. I zone out, heal up, zone in. And now there is another mob, obviously the "ghost", who hit me before.
Again: I understand lag, server/client problems, router is bad and all that stuff. What I cannot understand is the fact, that there is obviously no intention of FC to fix this.
I saw team mates dieing because of this, loosing several mill XP, myself died because of this very often and I am sure, everybody here suffered the same. 
My question: What do I need tactics? Why must I "learn" the game's mechanics, if a crappy bug like this destroys all effords within some secs (btw, it's just one of those really annoying bugs; meanwhile I could write a book and I am sure, higher levels could write several sequels)?

I have a friend that has the same problem.

I wish I could tell you how to fix it. 

It is really driven me crazy.  I gave my friend my old TnT2 vid card that i used to play AO on with no probs.  Now she has the block chat and can't read chat.  We tried everything short of buying a another vid card for her.

If anyone has an answer to this, plz do tell!

Magnificus @ 11/21/2002 2:38:09 PM (72115):
Ok we fixed hers!! yay!!

This  is what we did. When you log on to AO there is a button called "Settings" click it, now click the button called "Advanced Settings", now click "Restore Default Font"

Make sure your font is "Trebuchet MS, Bold Italic, 18"

 and we ran in window mode, no more block-chat


bah... I think all that didn't do anything.


we just tried it without window mode and still got the blocks.

Try playing in window mode.

That seems to get ride of the blocks. 

We will keep working on it though, if we come up with anything, ill let you know.

Here is a list of bugs (new and old) I've noticed while playing lately. Some are just anoying, while others are killers and fun-stoppers.

Bugs reported from: 11.21.2002 patch: 14.6

1. When logging into the game with the "show all names" option off, all names are still on.

Status: active

2. When sitting down and using heal or nano kits, you stand up and remain standing although you are still sitting.
UPDATE: This appears to be fixed, but is not since it still happens when you are morphed. So still active.

Status: active

3. When a mob has been reduced to 0 hit points, it continues to attack you even though you get the message: "target already dead" It will eventualy keel over and die and you get the XP.
UPDATE: I haven't seen this happening for quite some time now, so I'll asume it is fixed

Status: fixed in 14.7

4. When a mob has been killed (keeled over and you have gotten the XP) you still receive damage, presumably from the dead mob, although the text does not say who the aggressor is or what kind of dmg you take, i.e. "You were hit for 200 points of damage" rather than "You were hit by Hardened Enforcer for 200 points of melee damage" I have experienced beeing hit by this phantom damage as much as 5 times after the mob was killed. It appears to happen more often in teams than solo, although I have experienced the problem in both situations. Might be related to 3.
UPDATE: This also appears to be fixed

Status: fixed in 14.7

5. When flying in a yalmaha, using 1st person view, the front is sometimes visible and sometimes not. It appears to always be visible at low alltitudes and then sometimes dissapear when you fly higher.

Status: fixed in 14.7

6. When morphed (reet, leet, wolf, cat): the run animation stops when you jump, so that you just keep on floating/sliding over the ground. When you jump you sometimes never land but hang suspended in the air, floating around. The walk animation sometimes hang up so that you seem to constantly walk. All these might be dependent on playfield as it happens more in Andromeda for instance, than in Trade.

Status: active

7. When morphed (wolf, cat) and running down a hill, you are always horizontal so that half of you body disappears into the ground. This looks very bad and unprofesional.

Status: active

8. When morphed (reet, leet, wolf, cat) and sneaking, the strafe animation hangs, so that you continue to strafe even when you stand still. In leet form for instance, you keep on rolling on the spot.

Status: active

9. when fighting a boss in the outdoors (don't know if it happens fighting a boss indoors as well), nanos keep hanging so that you can't cast them properly.

Status: active

The list will be updated as they are fixed or new ones surfaces.

Odac @ 11/21/2002 3:12:10 PM (72120):
I also get this problem. You start attacking, see the weapon fire but do no damage and recieve no miss message. It always happens at the start of the fight for the first one or two shots.

Maximilian @ 11/21/2002 3:26:13 PM (943):
Hope they still read this thread (well, maybe after NW they might find time to do so).

A few points I can comment:

1) Work around: F10; check the 'Show-all-names'-box, uncheck it. Now it works properly. Annyoing, I know, I do it every time I log on - think this is fixed in Beta/Test, will check again.

2) - 3), ev. 4) They are working on that, solved it already, maybe?!

5) (Some of) the new Yalms don't have the 'nose' view any longer (hurray). I think, some of that code already slipped in. Described in Beta

So long,

Max(imilian)

HexTar @ 11/21/2002 3:56:23 PM (Ot Mobs In Ot Mission Bug? 72184):
Bug?

Yesterday I was soloing a "get item" team mission just north of 20k. After a while I started noticing that I didn't get exp for some of the kills.  To my surprise I discovered that some of the mobs were Omni, I thought hmm ok if I don't attack them maybe they won't return fire (like mech dogs did earlier).  I walked in to a room with a Omni mob didn't even target him and WHAM he attacked me, a few nukes later mob dies and guess what NO EXP just money for looting corpse.


Please fix!  Are Omni no longer loyal to eachother?

Or atleast give me exp for my kills, it's annoying to kill twice as many mobs and only get exp for half of them.

Shadowspawn @ 11/21/2002 4:08:11 PM (72131):
I've still had the mobs attack after they are dead. I'll get the Cannot attack target as it is already dead msg but the mob will still get off a couple of shots on me. Very dangerous and nasty.

Hypos @ 11/21/2002 4:13:22 PM (72120):
Maybe this is an effort by FunCom to balance weapons with casting.  If it is, then expect your weapon to start fumbling, to not fire under laggy conditions, and to permit you to accidently attack yourself.

Hypos @ 11/21/2002 4:15:54 PM (72184):
You were soloing a team mission.  When you teamed with another player to roll the mission, was the other player neutral or clan?  If so, then your team was neutral while you were rolling and thus the mission you generated would have some omni mobs.

In the future, only team with people from your own faction to roll these missions.

HexTar @ 11/21/2002 4:38:20 PM (72184):
Didn't think of that

The guy was standing in the middle of Omni Ent so silly me didn't even check.

Next time I will thanx.

HexTar @ 11/21/2002 4:55:20 PM (72184):
Just a suggestion!

Why not change the system though so that it checks what team side is before it attacks?  So if team side has changed since the mission was pulled mobs wouldn't attack if the current team side now was the same  as the mobs?  Mobs could then act like mech dogs did earlier, maybe even help take down mobs from enemy faction.  

This would create a whole new kind of mission type, more strategy involved.  

It's probably alot of programming for the devs, but hey it's just a thought.  It would be another option for a change in the monotony(spelling?) of mission after mission with no change.

As I said it's just a thought, feel free to shoot me out of the sky if you disagree.

Classof73 @ 11/21/2002 5:04:17 PM (Wrong damage 72208):
My "Torture Tool" on my MA is doing all kind of damage, mostly Energy, but it's supposed do Cold- damage...Please fix, since it's my choice of weapon on the MA!!

Hypos @ 11/21/2002 8:07:05 PM (72184):
It used to do that, Hexar.  Once people found out the following happened:[list=1][*]A clanner and an omni got together and rolled solo missions.  not team missions - they didn't team.[*]The clanner then gave his mission key to the omni.  The omni gave his key to the clanner[*]Each went off and walked through the other's mission to get the mission objective.  Neither ever got attacked, because all the mobs were from his side[*]They met again, exchanged mission items, got the reward[*]Return to step 1[/list=1]Too easy.  no risk involved whatsoever.  So FunCom changed the rules to how they are today.

Also, there's another problem with tokens.  If you don't kill mobs from your side (or don't get xp from them if you do kill them), then your chance of getting a token doesn't go up.  You can go through a long mission and still only have about a 50% chance of getting a token like that.

Lemain @ 11/21/2002 8:50:30 PM (72131):
there is a way: If you receive those messages, just sit down. The "dead" mob will then break down immeadiately. I've read this on the board here, tried it and it works. If in team, just tell your mates to do so. IMO the one, who killed the mob will get this effect.

Best

LittleHorror @ 11/21/2002 8:55:47 PM (69736):
I got it too, i even freeze up when trying to zone to Omni Trade. The rest of the zones go allright (well have not tested TIR and the other clan cities)

It happens at any button even at boss button, well i don't like to freeze when i'm trying to enter boss room, i was glad the team was keeping me alive.

So i quickly Close AO by using Taskmanager and restart AO and hope to be back online before i'm dead, so far i made it, there will be a day that i'll be looking at reclaim terminal if this bug keeps on being around after 14.7

Magnificus @ 11/21/2002 11:15:32 PM (68495):
I hear that a neutral PC can pull a team mission with Omni and clan NPCs both in mission. This would leave me to believe that if a clan mob was in the same room with a Omni mob, they might fight.  

I'm only guessing here but I do know that Neutrals DO in fact get both sides of the faction when they pull missions.

Bima @ 11/21/2002 11:44:24 PM (68495):
While you are correct, Slades, that is not what is happening here.

Obit @ 11/22/2002 1:47:43 AM (70938):

When I go to the shop in WW to sell off I can't seem to get out.  I zone back in no matter what I do, even just sit there for a few seconds.  The only way I have been able to stop the cycle is to alt-f4 as soon as I zone out and then log back in.

TheDarkAngel @ 11/22/2002 9:18:31 AM (Nano casting and Helath packs 72470):
I’m presently having the following problems don’t know if anyone else is…..

Cast Nanos:-

When in a mission I’m getting a lot of already casting or nanobots are busy messages, this can even be at the start of an encounter when I’m trying to cast my first nuke. The cast bars are no longer active when I try so it’s not me being impatient. This gets to the point where the attack and recharge of my nanos is huge due to always getting these message.

Outside bosses – Using nanos is almost impossible you cast the first “attack” nano and the nano icon on the shortcut bar greys out and either the recharge bar very very slowly goes down or stays at full. The only way to clear this is to repeatedly pickup the shortcut icon and put it back down again repeat 5-10 times even then sometime when u cast you get the cancelling previous cast message. This is so bad that I managed to get killed by a boss mob 30+ lvls below me yesterday!!!! 

Health packs

Happens from time to time but when it does happen it continues until you zone (although that doesn’t always solve it)– sit down right click on health pack and the count goes down but no “heal” if you click again get the message cannot be used for 12 seconds and repeat after 12 seconds……

YumYum Crow @ 11/22/2002 9:26:18 AM (72115):
Hi again.
Thanks for the suggestions, but I've tried them without much success.  I'm really tempted to uninstall the game and reload it about now .
Thanks for the help though

kthxbye @ 11/22/2002 10:53:17 AM (72115):
If something in your settings is screwy and you cant figure out what it is, you can try this method to restore it all to original settings. 

If your using the default install paths, this should be the path to open AO folder in windows explorer.

C:\Program Files\Funcom\Anarchy Online  

Remove the Prefs folder from the directory and save it elsewhere. *be sure to copy the Prefs folder into another directory as a backup*

Then just restart AO and see whats up then. If your chat is fine after that, just tweak your settings until your happy with them again.

 Good Luck

Pressing Escape works too ..

Snee @ 11/22/2002 12:54:13 PM (72120):
After patch I have also gone through some "Server Lost" issues and black doors, as Im sure alot of other players have. Another 14.6 issue is that during a fight with a mob you can suddenly lose your synch with the server. Youll just see everybody continue doing what they were doing .. shooting the mob. After a while it all breaks lose .. several shots get fired in one go, and your health as a tank will drop, get healed, drop etc all under half a second.

The thing is that not everyone get this synch problem. I will often find myself alone, or with someone elses poor soul, shooting at the mob when I do get synch back, but the rest of the team is off working on new mob.

Is there any point posting here by the way ????

Snee @ 11/22/2002 12:58:35 PM (72120):

W-T-F?

1) i die and i loose xp .... (damn it)
2) ARK delete my petition (ack!!! ack!!!)
3) hmmmm no coments. thx arks.

My question is : i don't care about lost xp... bleh... that's nothing. but, 
Just one thing : please funcom, oh please, don't recrut 12y old unmature arks... or tell me how can i contact a GM instead of an ark....

Neither Banks nor Mission Terminals display on the Ctl-6 minimap when the Machines map upgrade is installed.

Seems to be that wanting to find one of these in an unfamiliar area is something more people would want to do than finding Reclaim Terminals which, except for a couple of bugs, most people resurrect right next to.

These nuke do not do 50% of the listed damage in PvP, but 100%. Either the listed damage is incorrect or the nanos are broken. 

Also on a related note, these nanos are WAY too powerful because they are cast instantly and the target has next to no chance to resist it's effect.

First of all excuse me for my bad english 

Here's my problem. I've equiped a QL246 TS a long Time ago and i remember that it has an Perceptin requierment about 700, because i've never can't equipe it with an higher requierment at lvl 1xx (adv buff 680 + imps),now (after14.7) i have  the prob that my weapon shoots extrem slowl or completly didn't shot for 5-6 sec (after reload).
I think maybe its the Scope and want change it to an lower ql with only -167 ranged init. 
Im very lucky that i take a look on the requierments of my 8% scope befor i change it because it now wants 1256 perception!!!!
So is this a bug or a intention from Funcom or what?

Kneaker @ 11/23/2002 9:48:58 AM (Team Missions 73051):
Not sure if this is a bug or not and I don't remember seeing it in the patch notes, but when I get a team in tir then go to any other city besides tir to get a mission, all I get is the message "No missions available".  It seemed like you can't get a mission without your group being in the same town.  I thought nothing of it and just kept trying to get a mission in tir.  I got lucky and when we were done with the mission we all decided to meet back in athens.  When I got to athens there were only 2 of us there.  We both tried to get a mission but then we both got the same message.  After trying about 10 times I finally got the mission to spawn.  I was just wondering if anybody else has seen this and if funcom was aware of it.

during a team mission after the patch yesterday I picked a chest and had the following message come over chat:


"you lost xxxxx xp"  - where xxxxx was ~35k  


the other team members got it also, and their response was "wtf".  Naturally, we stopped picking locked chests at that point.  Is this a new type trap on locked chests or a bug? anyone know?

This is a PvP only nano so the damage listed is correct (FYI: it works only against GA). Also on a related note I think that all NT nanos should have about ~50% Nano Resist to separate them from other proffesion nukes and make the main damage source of the primiary AO DD class reliable.

Anyway some quote from the NT board:

Up to this date, fixers have been pretty much unkillable by any profession (nts included). That is the issue that has been adressed with this nuke, just as the soldiers anti-CH nano is -not- a soldier balanace nano.

No. This nano can be used against anyone, including mobs... it will only do a miniscule amount of damage.

Either the stated damage is wrong or the nano is broken. 

Uniformity is a must. Regardless of the public opinion on the matter of this nano, 50% damage in PvP is something we must be able to expect when looking at any given weapon or nano. 

Also, don't quote some random poster from the NT forum. He does not work for Funcom nor is his biased opinion relevent to this thread.

Hyoma @ 11/24/2002 5:03:35 AM (Break and enter skill bugged? 73376):
I looted and hacked a symbio graft today, a ql 113 one, soldier reflect, upon hacking the graft i was told i had lost 4415 xp. Naturally i was a little shocked, the graft was hacked as normal so that anyone could use, but having never lost exp before when hacking something i petitioned it. (still waiting on petiton currently). 
Then later in the mission the MA in my team picked the lock on a door, i got the normal xp for such a thing but she lost 4500xp and the NT in the team lost 4100xp as a result of opening the door.

Seemed to be random because all the doors after that in the mission behaved normally, havent got another symbio graft to try that again.

I targetted a guard outside Tir west gate & retreated to the point where the red range indicators show me as out of range. I then equipped my Movement Predictor & lo and behold, the range finders didn't turn red again. Repeated attempts gave the same result, so I was wondering if anyone else has noticed this?

While in the subway today, was - I'm sorry to say - camping Eumenides for that ring that does you know what. I've yet to get one.

Of course, no one likes to look at battle spam and kill Slum Runners while waiting, so I browsed through a few online newspapers, and one featured a quicktime movie implemented on one of its pages. I play in windowed mode, and when I alt+tab'ed back to the game, strange things started happening. All textures flickered, and here are examples:

http://www.transient.nu/ao/ao_strangeerror.jpg

As you can see, my name is completely illegible, as is the chat prompt.

http://www.transient.nu/ao/ao_strangeworldmap.jpg

This is the world map, though you wouldn't believe it 

After exiting the game and restarting it, hoping things would get better, something even stranger happened. The entire screen started shuffling about, and looked much like this (manipulated, the screenshot didn't capture it)

http://www.transient.nu/ao/ao_strangererror.jpg

Pretty sick. In addition to it looking like this, the luminosity of the textured flickered and varied alot as well.

This is Eumenides by the way, for those of you who have yet to meet him:

Can anyone fill me in on why the Cyborg Grid Jumper (the 1st cyborg) isnt there? I've read a guide that you have to kill the Lunaspells plant in order to spawn the cyborg. Well I've killed it like 5 times now but the thing still wont spawn. I checked the 2 last cyborgs, they were there (cyborg grid hacker & cyborg fixer)

Evilspork @ 11/25/2002 5:32:16 AM (73533):
I used to think they added a fixed meter range, but someone told me that they in fact add a percentage to your range. So, if you're using a short range weapon (10-15m) and a low ql predictor, you're not gonna see much difference in that instance assuming they *do* work. Just FYI.

Evilspork @ 11/25/2002 5:34:29 AM (72898):
Just FYI (  ) NTs could wipe the floor with GA fixers before this new nuke. This just makes it that much easier.

Seraphim @ 11/25/2002 6:40:57 AM (72898):
And this is probably the fifth thread that Hoops complains in how destructive these nanos are to the Fixer profession.

In fact, I am beginning to see a parallell between Fixers with Grid Armour and the poor people living on wellfare... both are so desperate to have this insurance of "survival" that they lose their perspective and ability to think. Instead, they will act out of desperation and resort to anything that keeps their nose above the waterline.

Seuss @ 11/25/2002 12:16:07 PM (Doctor Complete Heal, bugged?? EEEK! 73854):
Ever been in a group getting the snot beat out of you and the doc is losing the battle and you are about to die...

Doc executes "Complete Heal" to regain control and what does he see but... "Target does not have enough NCU to execute this program"... Death soon follows.

Complete Heal is the ONLY doctor heal nano that has a NCU req!

1NCU
00:00:01 Duration


No other doc nanos have this requirement, thus opening the door for two nasty scenareos:
- The intended patient has his NCU full and the program cannot be run and they die. Why was this nano created with no durration and 1 NCU requirment? doesnt make much sense, the Full Team Complete Heal does not have this Req, why this one?

- Having a NCU req forces the NCU availability check when the nano is cast, in one instance (Today), was bugged and the target died as a result stating the target did not have enough NCU when in reality they did.  (The victom lost 10+ million experience)



I reported the occurance to ARK, dont know how it will be followed up so I am posting here to be sure.

Hmm. I was told by an ARK yesterday, while petitioning another matter, that the number in the stats is a actually a metre increase. This is why I posted here.

The char I did the test on is my little fixer, he's using a manex so yes it's a short range weapon. I was hoping to add 5 metres to the range with a low QL predictor, but it didn't seem to do a damn thing LOL

The percentage increase theory would certainly explain this though, I wonder if anyone can clarify?

I also got the same problem AFTER installing the new Nvdia Detonator 4 drivers. I just removed those drivers, went back to my card manufacturer site and reinstalled the old drivers, Release 30.82. Fixed the problem. The new drivers are no good for my GeForce3.

What options do I have as an angry customer? I can just shut up and let this crap by forced on me, or I can voice my objection like anyone  should be able to do. I can choose not to PvP or take part in Notum Wars. 

This thread is a VERY valid one. The damage listed on the nano is not halved in PvP. It does need to be changed. Uniformity is a must.

At any rate, it looks like Funcom is just ignoring this thread. It's not really surprising considering the amazing amount of bugs that have been left in the game for so long. 

Whatever. I don't need more stress.

Hypos @ 11/25/2002 5:41:57 PM (72898):
Agreed.  If the nano does x damage in PvM, it's only supposed to do x/2 in PvP.  Certainly a bug.

Also, since using a bug to your advantage is an exploit, I would say that casting this in PvP is probably an exploit right now.

Hypos @ 11/25/2002 5:45:08 PM (73854):
Yep, this is a total pain.  You should visit the doc board, Seuss, there's a good amount of complaining going on about it over there.

Explain it? It's simple... If you dig around in the some obscure database you'll discover that it really does twice the damage that is listed on the nano. I shouldn't have to dig around in databases to find my answers. 

50% damage is something that we must be able to take for granted when glancing at any item in the game. Just because this nano is used mainly in PvP doesn't mean that it should be misleading or an exception.

It's a simple fix, just change the damned text so that it lists the real damage and all is fine. This does not need any fanboy commentaries. Get out of my thread.

That option was removed some time back by FunCom.  They optimized their engine, or something like that, so that option was no longer relevant.

Varfleet @ 11/26/2002 8:13:21 AM (Boss Loot Bug 74261):
Okay just finished a team mission with 2 nice lads, both new to AO.

Shorty story, we killed the boss, then the lackeys, then it was loot time.  I got the loot for the boss.  Well, after taking the first item, EVERY ITEM IN THE BOSS LOOT TURNED INTO NoName ITEMS!

Of course I sent a petition knowing about 99.9% of what they will say.  But there are 2 problems here:

1.  New players to AO going through a pretty tough battle with boss (they were both 46 and 51, playing an alt with them) only to be rewarded with a bug that doesn't allow me to loot the boss and let them keep the stuff leaves a very BAD taste in their mouths.  I didn't want any of it, this was my alt playing.  But, even with the new loot posting, it makes me look bad, because I didn't get the boss loot.

2.  How many others have had this problem and are getting more and more frustrated with the game?

I just simply want to state that the customer service policy needs to be changed asap.  I mean, they were able to track duped credits from player to player before, why can't they verify that a bug occured and reimburse?  This will take away some of the tarnish.

I noticed (while playing my trader) that if you divest yourself and use a virus scanner to remove it, it only removes the negative effect and not the transfer. 

It says in the description it removes both the negative effect as well as the transfer in the trader's NCU. It does work with plunders and ransacks, but not divests or deprives. 

I haven't tested with a higher/lower QL Virus Scanner, though I would assume the problem is the same. I was using QL 90 Virus Scanners when I found out.

Encountered this bug yesterday.

None of my team could pull any missions from the team mission terminals. Kept getting that stupid message saying something like "no missions available".

Zoned a few times. Didn't work.

Only managed to resolve it by disbanding and re-forming the team.

Worst part was, when I click on the LEAVE button in the team menu, there is NO RECRUIT BUTTON! ie. I could not initiate forming of teams. Good thing some of the rest of my teammates could still recruit. (a few others got the same bug).

I will try again and it may counter, or blackhole, or fumble, but if none of those happens it may calm, or I might get the message again. 

If you keep trying it will calm.

Ratty @ 11/28/2002 6:09:06 PM (team side problem, fatal problem for neutrals 75264):
I'm a neutral, I teamed with people who were all omni.
It said "team side omni". I thought, hey this could be cool, maybe when they pull a mission it wont have OT mobs, and the team will whine less at me.

But it was worse... far worse. 

The team mission was still filled with OT mobs, except now the entire team did not get xp for killing same sided mobs. AND killing those mobs didnt count towards token %, so even though everything was dead, it was only 70% clear.

This is an outrage, I hope this is a bug. It will be impossible to get into any OT/Clan team because me being there would rob them of xp and token, if I was a clanner/omni I wouldnt want to team with me either in that situation.

I just hope it's a bug, and I'm used to game stopping bugs in this game, we all are. Hopefully it will be fixed soon.

If it's a deliberate attempt to screw neutrals that want to team with omni/clan, as sad as it will make me I'll have to cancel. I'm not going to pick which set of friends I play with, clan or omni, I'll just tell them all goodbye and share contact info.

Harlequin @ 11/28/2002 7:30:01 PM (75264):
whoa.

now this is nasty indeed, i also noticed that the team side now reported omni/clan instead of neutral when you joined up, and i was thinking the exact same thing as far as teams and mobs went, but i never got to test it due to some rather heavy disconnecting issues *cough*

if this turns out to be anything but a bug i'd be very much surprised, but it's also one of those oversights that really makes you wonder how much testing is being done before sending things to live. (as for neutrals, it really makes the 12.6 patch pale in comparison)

going to be fun to see if they actually managed to fix it with the little 30-minute patch that's being applied now, i'm half-tempted to say we might be in for a nasty surprise when we log back on 
(as i'm guessing the whines that have been registered and looked at currently have been the server lost issues)

update

Game servers back up. teamed with omni, pulled mission, ran to it, OT mobs and "team side omni". nope not fixed.

Yeah, had this happen today too, me and a lot of neutrals... side was clan (ok, but different from previous) but the mission (pulled by a neutral) had clan mobs in it...

So, either give xp for the mobs

OR

(more likely) Make sure that a mission does not generate mobs the same side as the team (which I'm sure used to be the case).

Fix It!

Sounds like a bug in the mission generator...

Uniques seem to be causing more hassle than they are preventing. Just one example of unique wierdness... took a bag out of the bank, and two items fell out (already have this unique...) - my appartment key (which has no need to be unique since I can't get another one anyway...) and my dodga card I (for which the unique tag is reasonable). Since I had neither anywhere else, this implies that the game thinks the dodga card and my appartment key are the same unique... ???

Yup, working as intended

Skymarshal @ 11/29/2002 2:36:29 AM (75264):
It seems to me like its a ug in the team side, not the mission generator.


The teams side is reporting to the mission generator as neutral, so you are getting a mix of all thre sided mobbs, however the team side is reporting the te XP generation code as Clan/Omni, and the respective mobs are not giving XP.

This is also an improtrant problem for PvP, cant have full teams of omni reporting as neutral (That is happening too)


Just my input

Ah, yes, that sounds plausible - the missions are still using the old method (which would have reported such a mixed team as neutral before).

Ratty @ 11/29/2002 2:28:01 PM (75264):
So they either need to:

1. Have teams report as neutral/missing as before.
2. Make team missions pulled by a team with all omnis and a neutral have only clan/neutral mobs.

p.s. I heard this isnt a problem with a clan+neutral team, haven't tested it.

Releasing a pvp oriented boosterpack with some essential pvp bugs currently in place? I wont even bother to mention them in detail, as you must surely know of these by now, so much I and other have nagged about it to no avail..

Is there a special reason for refusing to fix pvp game mechanic errors/bugs, or is it just on the bottom of the priority list?

It have been impossible to get an answer on this issue for weeks now, on boards and ingame contact, last try before I give up....

Darkbane @ 11/29/2002 6:14:05 PM (75264):
Change One

It looks like a sided team gets no xp from MOBs of the same side. I assume neutral teams and MOBs don't count as sided in this case...

Change Two

Adding a clan member to an otherwise all neutral team now makes the team clan (previously it would have been neutral).

However, it looks like the mission generator is still using the old code and generating the mission as if for a neutral team (ie containg MOBs from both sides and neutral MOBs)

Result

MOBs in a mission you get no xp or token chance increase for.

Darkbane @ 11/29/2002 6:35:16 PM (71396):
Clearly the game thinks these are in fact the same item. In your case, they are almost the same, but almost isn't the same thing... Until FC actually explain in detail why all these things are not only unique, but often seem to be the same unique despite being different, we'll just have to guess...

I was level 40, killed the mob, got 1425 xp (14xp side bonus), then hit level 41 and got an additional 1411 xp. After that I completed the mission, and got 430 xp and cash 5740. Right under that it said I lost 977 xp. Under that 4 xp side bonus.

It looks like it takes back that extra xp I got from that one mob when I leveled by subtracting it later. 

I also had this happen with lockpicking... I was getting around 800 xp per pick then killed a mob and got the extra xp from that mob again, later I picked a lock and only got 99xp for that lock. I think it made up the difference there also.

Rugger807 @ 11/30/2002 3:34:30 AM (The top 14 bugs I could think of offhand.  Sorry.  This game is currently unplayable 75813):
1. Reload time on the OT 12 went from 2 seconds to 15-30 last patch.

2.  Pets now instead of warping to master, warp 10 rooms away or right to the nearset wall.

3.  Engineer blind line dissapates no matter what.

4.  Morphs for Slayer Trans are completely stuck again.

5. Attack bar Sticking for OT 12 for 8-10 seconds on a non reload.

6. Sync problems between client/server causing graphics glitches,  zoning into wrong buildings

7.  "Mission Key not Accepted"  Love this, wasn't this fixed in the 12 series somewhere?  As much as I love the retro feel.....

8.  Engineer pets dissapearing after death.  Appears that singe the pets do not recognize the master the go into mob mode and deactivate after 10 mins.

9.  Mob pets sitting around for an hour or two, having tea, screwing up targeting, getting agro.

10.  All areas are filled with lag, even if empty.    Not video lag.  Video lag doesn't cause 90k pings.

11.  Sync errors causing mobs to warp acros missions.

12.  "You lost xxxx xp"  2 minutes after gainining an extra xxx xp.

13.  Aura of Intrusive xxxxx  activates after you die agroing everyone in the area.  Such a nice present when your bot dies at the reclaim in a 100% zone.

14.  Please make the hurting stop or let us revert our clients back to 13.0.   Frankly your last 5 patches have made this game worse than beta.   I was there the first week where instadeath and timewarping ruled.  This is worse.  This game is unplayable.

I agree with previous poster. Refer to one computer software company that has no bugs in their software, please.

Here is a nut for you to crack. Microsoft has plenty of bugs in their latest accomplishment for mentally incapable people, namely Windows XP, and they expect you to pay for their software. So does Funcom expect you to when you play this game, despite it is buggy or not, you are expected pay for the montly subscription as you play a game that is solely a multiplayer online game.

Feel free to cancel your account if you'd like. But please erase any installed software on your computer while you are at it, as they surely have a bug or two.

The "bug" is caused by a desynch between server and client, as the server sends out beeps to your computer once and awhile to see if you are still there or not. And of course, if it is prime time for people in countries across the globe, like Japan and America, you can do nothing but muster through it. 

Bandwidth limitations and what type of connection people have is the cause. 

PS. I have heard the typical explanation that "I-can-play-any-other-game-but-AO!" before. I can, hence it is not Funcom's fault and I am sorry.. but that is your problem.

I've double checked ( I did almost break my 'Enter' key) the process itself, zoned and had the other person zone as well, and the creds will never appear in the queue. even when the trade is accepted the amount never changes on my character. either way I'm still opting to leave the game once I'm done transfering what I have to my friends.

Everytime I step into a new room inside a mission, I get "Controlled land: <name of area> Controlller: None" floating mid-screen. Fine, it's nice to know such things outside, where you can actually place controllers and such. But inside missions? And at every room?

Bima @ 11/30/2002 4:40:30 PM (Flying straight down flips camera orientation 75982):
If you fly straight down, or nearly so, the camera's orientation gets flipped from where it usually is, and it is very disorienting.  Normally your head or the top of the yalm is up on the screen, but if you get verticle downward enough then your head/yalm roof is pointed switch to the bottom of the screen.

Yeah I know this is an old bug, but I got in a bug reporting mood over in 14.7 forum and just encountered this old familiar one again so I though I'd mention it.

On a related note, I really REALLY wish my 3t camera would stay where I told it to when I zone.  I have to adjust the camera far more often than I really care to because it is not respecting the position I set it in.

Bima @ 12/1/2002 3:59:31 AM (West Athen insurance scanner bugged 76158):
I suspect this is an issue the devs have known about for a long while, but maybe it dropped off the list.

Scanning in West Athen, not sure which terminal, will sometimes cause you resurrect south of West Athen, outside of the normal zone boundaries (putting you in what should be Athen Shire).  Running north from there to get to reclaim in West Athen will cause you to zone into Athen Shire as though you had been running south from West Athen.  Then you can turn around and run north again and finally end up in West Athen to go to reclaim.

Zenoxx @ 12/1/2002 4:11:49 AM (NO Exp when on different level of team mish 76163):
Not sure if this is intended or not but I have seen this a couple of times.  Couple different situations with them.  First one was player was at entrance and went AFK.  We were cleaning up first floor and when we were farther away this person wasn't getting any experience.  Another time was me and a buddy were in boss room.  Was a tough fight and we were both popping up and down at times.  Boss was almost dead and so was I so I clicked on button and healed up for a sec.  Then I see Bonus Experience 8134 but no xp from the boss.  I go up and see boss dead.  I was a little pissed that I didn't get XP from the boss that took great team work to take down that lasted 15 minutes.

  Has anyone else seen this or is it intended?  Oh I did check my XP and it didn't add it without showing it either

I don't know wth is going on but I can be anywhere in the game even at different towers and some of our own towers without a problem but when I get within view distance of our 200 tower I crash. And then I cannot log again. Actually my guildies say they can see me log but I just see the loading screen. I hear the enviroment effects but am effectively trapped in a crash loop and each time I relog i have the same problem.

I have been rescued two times already and am in need of another rescuse as I type this.

Is anyone else having this problem?

There were also a couple times where I could run around (probably already crashed) and talking on guild and vicinity and /tells but could not cast a nano and then soon after would crash. I could save myself and log back on but only if I wasn't too close to the main tower.

This has been my only problem with the game in quite some time and it is making NW meaningless to me because I cannot help my guild defends its towers.

Lumin @ 12/1/2002 8:59:29 PM (Bug with despawning of mob pets 76392):
Last night when me and my team was playing doing a mission we encountered something quite strange.

in the begining of the mission we met a engineer mob that spawned a slayer droid type 2.
once we killed the mob the slayer stoped attacking and our doc opened loot window on the engineer and went afk for 15 min.
in the mean time the bot did not despawn, we tought that this might had something to do with the body still being in the room.
after those 15 min our doc returend and looted off the body and closed the loot window.
now this didnt despawn the slayer at all, we tried to attack it and then leave the mission, no good. even calm it, but still no success.
it just didnt want to despawn. however it didnt aggro either, it just stod there making stupid sounds.

its always fun to have a large slayer stand in the front of the exit door in your mission

Lumin @ 12/1/2002 9:05:16 PM (76241):
had the same problem. but I managed to close all the maps and friends lists and such and voila I was back.
this also happends to me rarely in very populated areas. it might be related to the map, cause if I close that and my buddy list I can login again with no problem.
I usualy login to another char to close the different side menus.

Get a clue. NTs could wipe the floor with GA fixers before this nano, and so could any MP or Trader. And anybody that could get together a decent number of specials had a good chance too. That's hardly "no real disadvantages". Don't come in here and say it should be nerfed just because you don't know anything about GA and think it's god mode.

And GA adds to all def., not all off.

Blech @ 12/2/2002 12:41:48 AM (Automatic reload times are borked 76464):
Repro 

Use a really slow weapon with that has a clip size of 1 like an Arwen 404 grenade launcher.

Start timing
Attack a mob, notice after the first attack there is a huge pause while the attack bar is at maximum.
After a long while the reload bar comes up and you reload.
Next shot you see the same pause when the attack bar is at max
Stop Timing

Now do this.
Start timing
Attack a mob. a second after the attack bar reaches maximum turn off the attack.
Reload by dragging a ammo on to the weapon.
Turn attack on.
Stop timing

Reloading by hand is easily 2 to 3 times faster. This really borks any size one clip weapon pretty much making them useless unless you want to manually reload after each shot.

Blech @ 12/2/2002 12:51:22 AM (Pet AoE Snare are affecting players sometimes 76471):
Repro

Insure your self at a terminal that is near a guard.
Have a noobie stand near the terminal
Zone to another zone
Create a pet cast your AoE snare on your pet
/terminate yourself
Notice that the noobie is now dead.  Usually you can see the tail end of the guard killing the noobie.


I assume what is happening is that the pet reaches reclaim first.
Since there is no master yet it goes into NPC mode.
It pulses a snare which hits the noobie
The noobie automatically attacks the pet
The guard then kills the noobie since it attacked my pet

Miir @ 12/2/2002 1:16:25 AM (73533):
It's definately a percentage.

A +5 scope on a manex would give you 15.75m range.

If it were a meter increase, a QL150 Yatamutchy Movement Predictor would give melee better range than a Sniper rifle.

According to designers a team of Neutrals and people from one side (clans / Omni-Tek) is supposed to belong to that side. Thus I suppose they should get missions as if they were pure clan or Omni-Tek. I'll report this as a bug.

Xtrophic @ 12/2/2002 2:09:27 PM (Mission XP bug (or feature?) 76632):
I noticed that starting with the 14.7.x series of patching there is what appears to be a severe XP bug.

When you are missioning now and end up out of range from your teammembers and they kill a target you do not recieve any XP anymore. All you see is the % completed increase, but no XP is recieved. 
I can see the point in doing this if the intention is to stop leechers, ie if they go ninja looting, just camp entrance or go take a coffee or something, they are not going to gain XP. If this indeed is the intention then fine, but it has one major flaw, if you get rooted you end up with a loss of XP. Another possible situation is when you take upon you to clear any leftovers on a level while the team moves up a floor and start clearing that. In this scenario you have 1 person on the lower floor clearing any possible mobs, this one will loose XP. I am sure you can all see the cons and pros of this XP bug or feature.

I have to put in a reservation for myself here, I have not confirmed the XP loss by comparing gained XP, so it might just be a visual bug. However it requires that someone look into it.


I have also discovered a workaround for this bug/feature and that is if you pick a lock you will get all lost XP in one chunk. This I have confirmed in teams, ie we took turns in staying out of range, then someone picked a lock on a door or chest and all the sudden it showed "You gained X xp" where the X could go up to 500k in some instances, not the 2-3k you normally get :P

This workaround I think suggests / supports that it is indeed a bug of some kind.

Cz: Will you please test this one out and relay the information to the dev department so that they can have a look at it too.

The Distant @ 12/2/2002 2:31:02 PM (75150):
Not a software developer, are you? Or else you'd know the difference between a "bug" and a BUG. And a good bit of the bugs that FC is letting get out into AO are BUGS. Things that could be easily tested for, in some cases CRASH bugs. Now, I don't care about "Well, Windows crashes if you do this"...we all know MS is crap. But if I were to sign off on a release at my company, with the kind of bugs FC is letting get out, I would be fired on the spot. They release patch notes that don't enumerate all the new "love", they've claimed that stuff is fixed when it isn't, and they release patches with what appears to be not even the most rudimentary tests on their own end. That's software development like a CS undergrad or a "bunch of guys writing code", not like a company that's trying to compete directly with The Big Boys.

A hint from someone in the field: Bugs are not standard operating procedure. You heard me, it's not "standard" or "correct" to simply throw some code into an editor, recompile, run a diff, and make some patches. I agree with the first poster - I'm giving AO a few more months, and if I still feel like I'm paying to playtest a beta, I'll quit.

In a sense, yes. Welcome to the wonderful world of

Of course, that doesn't mean we should get patches like 14.6 - but there were (saddly) other reasons for that calamity. Hopefully we'll see the next major patch concentrate on fixing as many of the bugs introduced by 14.6/14.7 as possible...

This is not the feedback forum. This thread requires no spammy, not-so-witty and opinionated responses. 

To date, the bug that the original post detailed has not been addressed or aknowledged (listed damage not being halved in PvP). I can't see why Funcom is being so obtuse over the matter, it is highly unprofessional.

CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION! and the problem is solved, unless the original intent was to purposefully mislead players into believing that the nano line will do less damage against it's target in PvP.

Using the "it works against GA, so it's a PvP nano only" line is NOT a valid excuse. There is at least one mob on Rubi-ka that wears Grid Armor.

Ionstar @ 12/2/2002 6:32:29 PM (Worst thing that can happen to anyone: OMG I Deleveled! 76718):
I couldnt believe what just happened. I dont complaint, I dont talk ***** but what I just experienced was a worst thing that can happens to any AO player. I DELEVED  Yup I was level 115 yesterday, got a team mish, crashed and didnt bother to log back on. Today I loged as a level 112 with my implants & ncu hacker interface (i'm a fixer) reseted. WTF?

I've sent a petition but I'm holding little hope what they would/can do. At this point the only thing I can do is trying to get a hold of players/witnesses that actually saw that I was indeed level 115.

There was also a super weird problem I've been experiencing. I'm not sure if this related to deleveling. I had been existing in 2 places at the same time! Whenever I was in mission, I could see other people chating on my screen. I even got /tells from people asking for ncu buff and run buff. I told them that I'm in mission, they said I'm there in my yalm next to tir grid. It had happened like this for days. To top that off, it appears that my char still in the world after I loged off for the night, cus I got like 5-8 offline messages from people asking for buffs everytime I loged on.

I've been playing this game for over a year and a half and I've been loving it. But this is beyond my imagination to a point It made me speechless. 3 levels may not seemed too hard to get but my point is this shouldnt happen in the first place!

/me waiting impatiently for an ARK.

The Distant @ 12/2/2002 7:50:46 PM (76392):
That's happened to me a lot too, and I didn't even have to go AFK. I'll tell you what's *really* funny, though - trying to predict the next random dialog to come out of a mob's mouth when it fails to aggro you. I stood around a couple weeks ago holding a conversation with a Helper-type bot. Damn thing refused to aggro me. Fifteen minutes. Then I finally smacked it upside its stupid metal head. I wish I'd known about screenshots back then -  Okay, so I'm still a n00b.

Mercatura @ 12/2/2002 9:25:48 PM (75863):
There was a bug on test that even if you bought both maps (theres two for newland) you still couldn't see the desert. I set my mapnav to 700 and bought every single map. It was a "known bug" on test.

Are you having this same bug? Or something else.

If something else, they split newland into 2 maps quite awhile ago.

Majikall @ 12/2/2002 11:07:49 PM (75982):
Another thing I've noticed. If you get into your yalm while facing forward, then the yalm is normal.. but try looking at a different angle, like straight up. Look straight up and get into your yalm. The vehicle ends up pointing at some weird angles.

Unforntunately this only works if you are not doing anything else besides watching the battle.  If you start casting nanos, healing etc while doing this you tend to get the dread Wait for your previous action to end which basically locks your attacks off for even longer.

Well, that is true that so is the case that you often recieve "please-wait-for-the-current-action-blah-blah" message. But that should be a mental reminder for you and everyone to reload at the beginning of the battle and at the end of the battle and, not to forget, before the battle. 

And as a minor sidenote here; I cannot, of course, not say what your mates prefer if you heal them or you shoot at the mob, but I would prefer that you focused on healing than fighting. But then again, that is my opionion. 

Lastly, I believe that you can do more than just heal and shoot simultaneously. But again, that is just me.

Then try to relog and no luck even though I hear the fight music. Try relogging several times and the only time it worked was when I found my ass sitting at reclaim!

I am fighting through the lag like everyone else it is the damn towers!!

Is there a Crash Novalia Tower or something?

That is not the problem it is the manual reloading 5 or 6 times during the battle that blows chunks.

I dont even bother equiping my grenade launcher now, and just rely entirely my braindead bot.  Now if i could just get all my ips back that are now in a useless skill.

Simple First Aid Kits dont work when you have a car equipped and attack on.   Same thing applies to Simple Nano Kits.

Repro steps
Equip a car
Put a Simple First Aid Kit on your hotbar
Target something and attack it, be out of range so you dont immediately kill it.
Try to use your First Aid Kit
Nothing happens
Wait 20 or 30 seconds
Turn off your attack notice now the First Aid Kit effect goes off.

I have been palying since August 2001 and this is the first time I have seen this.

I was invited to a team the same time as another person....I guess I didn't react fast enough, so they invited another person. Well we both must of clicked OK at the same time because now we were the #6 and #7 team members. With the other guy at #7 clearly showing on the team list, with HP and NP bars. We were able to pull a mish and run it without any problems.

Weird.

This has been around for a while, but it not very reproducable.

But this was almost 8 months ago.

Interesting, just a couple of questions:

Did you get  seven rewards/a reward each in the following team mission?

Did this affect how much boss loot/mobbs there was/were?

Bug or a feature? 7player teams...nah FC would have added that to the patch notes..wouldn't they?

Mind you with a seven player team the only disadvange I can think of would be a little more lagg

I had a mission token in the inventory overflow, and have been unable to recieve new ones since then. Am getting a message" you already have this unique item", or something like that. I even made the overflow open on purpose to see if the old token was still there, which it wasn't. I know that this was allegedly addressed a few patches ago( don't recall the patch #), but the problem persists for my character, just a heads up on it.

Odac @ 12/4/2002 3:23:57 PM (76464):

RedSonja @ 12/4/2002 6:35:55 PM (77456):
Well not really as the token you find on MOB's is not the same as the one you get for completing a mission - MOB tokens are only ever worth 1 token no matter what level you are.
Seen other people report the same and after calling a GM the problem was fixed - one person I know did have a token in their bank which the GM was kind enough to find, the other was just simply bugged.

Sadly this work around does not always work.

Also it is not too easy finding a passing mob when trying to defend a tower.

As an engie I spend enough time getting my bot, it is a real problem when I can't team. (also being neutral means that when I find a team I really need to be able to join it!)

http://v020u46eff.maximumasp.com/AOD...sp?AOID=204293

Now - the Description field holds info on the nano  stating the pvp damage that it does - in this case 323-767. The Effects portion however states the actual stats of the nano - in this case: Health -646 - -1534 EnergyAC. So as you see - given that this is a nano meant for pvp, they have done the 50% calculation allready in the description field. 

So please stop this meaningless debate of this nano not obeying the 50% dmg pvp rules. If you think the nano is overpowered and should be nerfed - fine, say so. But dont pretend that it's bugged - get your facts straight before posting crap like this!

That's the goddamn point. There are GA mobs that this line of nanos would work against. Thus, you would think it would do the damage listed in the description to those mobs, like every other nano that does damage. Instead, it will do "double" damage to these mobs. There needs to be consistancy between this stupid nano line and other nano lines. If they insist on keeping it in the game, they need to change the description damage to its "actual" damage which can be properly applied to mobs and properly halved for PvP battle.

Thanks for once again spamming my thread with rehashed information. 

Yes, we've all seen that database and yes we all understand that the amount of damage listed on the nano is intended for PvP. 

Who cares?

Uniformity is a must.

I should not have to dig around in a third-party database to find out if the ref of the new chew toy is misleading or plain wrong. It doesn't take a lot of common sense to see the problem here. We need to be able to assume that any given item will follow long-standing rules.

There is at least one mob on Rubi-ka that has been seen to wear Grid Armor, so please don't feed us the 'pvp-only' line. If you want to see it, check out Wailing Waste. I'm not a tour guide, you're on your own.

I'll say it one more time: The amount damage listed in the damage section of the nano is showing correct PvM-stats. However, they have listed the PvP-damage in the description of the nano. Do you still fail to see the difference?

Guess what - you dont have to! Get ingame, go to your nearest advanced supermarket, check out the NT nano vendor and read the same stats there! The databases are just a more convenient way of reading the very same stats.

The only "problem" here is that the way they display the damage in the Comment tag of the nano is arguable. The way the nano is set up it follows the standard rules for pvp - it does 50% damage.

Yes - and the nano in my example will do 100% damage on the mob, while doing 50% in PvP. Again I fail to see the bug here. 

And please - I am not feeding you a pvp-only line. I tried stating that my guess to why they have done the 50% calculation in the comment tag, is because this nano's main intention is for pvp. See the diference?

On a final note - being an NT I'm not to happy about either this new anti-GA nuke in particular or the paper-rock-scissor system in general. So as I said before: If you think the anti-GA nano is too powerful and want it nerfed - say so. Dont hide behind a silly bug-claim, accept the fact that the only "bug" here is the way they calculated 50% in the comment tag. And thats not really worth a long thread, is it?

Hypos @ 12/5/2002 6:40:16 PM (67958):
Yep, had this happen while defending a tower.  My opponent backed out of the 25% area and broke off combat.  I still had aggro on him, but I wasn't attacking and couldn't use hostile nanos anymore.

Are you having this same bug? Or something else.

If something else, they split newland into 2 maps quite awhile ago. 
			
		
	
That's it, I've uploaded both maps and the desert is the only one that won't come up.  I just created a trader and she is having the same problem, but as long as it is a know issue then I just have to wait.

Darkbane @ 12/5/2002 8:59:01 PM (75264):
Best workaround at the moment is to do solo missions instead, and get a non-neutral team member to roll it - should generate based on their affiliation (if that doesn't work, get them to roll it whilst unteamed). No boss loot or team rewards, but if its only xp your after, it shouldn't matter. Just roll 2 or 3 in the same place.

Majikall @ 12/5/2002 9:06:22 PM (Kin of Tarasque... again!? 78005):
I don't know if this is a bug.. I have a feeling its a bug with the loot tables though. For the past few days, since someone else pointed it out to me, every mission I've done has had a Kin of Tarasque nano in the boss loot. Sometimes not just once, but twice, and the last mission I did, three times, though one of those was an instruction disk.

Is this a bug or not? Surely not every boss should have 1-2 Kin of Tarasque nanos and no other nanos. That doesn't make sense. Please check this out FC.

Spookdoc

P.S. The missions I'm doing around about 190+

Hypos @ 12/6/2002 12:11:29 AM (78005):
I remember when the "Adv love" patch came out, people were complaining about how rare some other nanos were.  I think FunCom was trying to make a point with the Kin nanos.

As usual, FunCom has never said.

Personally, I don't mind.  I take them to sell to shops and no one on the team ever complains.  It was a running joke for a while - lots of us were calling it "uber rare' and pretending we'd only heard rumors of it being found.  Of course, any novelty in that has passed.

Kugatsu @ 12/6/2002 1:21:26 AM (looted NoDrop items 78094):
I have to say, while it might not be the most hindering of game play bugs, the problem with looted NoDrop items is annoying right now.  Any ND item that is looted from a mob corpse, drops to the player corpse whenever they die.  Have had this happen with dog-tags and several looted MA attacks so far, everytime I die, I have to get them out of the reclaim.

Kugatsu @ 12/6/2002 1:25:47 AM (77911):
Having the same issues w/ the yo-yo effect.  Was blitzing a mission earlier today and got snapped back to a point I had been almost 30s earlier.  And I know its not lag on my end, because when I got up to the point where I had been before, all 10-15 of the mobs that were following me were there, trapped in a room trying to get at me still.

Kugatsu @ 12/6/2002 1:35:13 AM (76158):
i think its the terminal closest to the bridge leading to old athen that causes this.  has happened to me a couple times.  finally stopped saving there.

Waffen @ 12/6/2002 5:23:29 AM (77866):
I can verify this.  Just got a ql170 version in a mission, hacked it and the agent requirement stayed.

I thought this was supposed to be fixed a couple patches ago?

Dimmufodr @ 12/6/2002 6:41:48 AM (69094):
Galway County (and NL Desert??) map is bugged atm. Galway Shire, Wailing Wastes and possibly more are missing from shops. 
Wailing Wastes have been missing for omni/neutral for one year, this should be a very simple thing to fix *chough* But with the current trend I predict that we will have less maps one year from now than we have today.

Wobble @ 12/6/2002 11:16:39 AM (76464):

even if you manually reload you still have to wait the annoying 10 seconds befroe you can start combat, utterly unacceptable in fast team missions.

Gartan @ 12/6/2002 12:20:08 PM (76464):
I get this bug with my support Beam which doesn't need reloading.

I attack the bar fills then stops for anything between 1 sec and 5 and then i attack and the bar emptys.  Doesn't happen all the time but is starting to get anoying.  Enven had this happen while runnig rage and flurry with a melee int of likw 1300+

Gartan @ 12/6/2002 12:28:19 PM (PGC's are they broken? 78231):
I have tried both a ql150 and ql200 Personal grid Converter on our towers (ql 75 and a ql150) and neither work.

I right click the PGC on the control tower the blue bar fills and nothing. Tried it several times.  

One of the guild mates tried it and it works for him.

Definately a bug. Assigned to a designer.

DizzyDean @ 12/6/2002 2:23:34 PM (New NW tower to prevent getting out of plane 78255):
I couldn't help defend The Dojo's tower on Rimor last night because I couldn't get out of my damn plane.  I tried multiple times.  The Yalmaha would go into my inventory but I would still be hanging in the air.  Tried to put the plane back on but I couldn't because I was already "morphed".

I had to fly all the way back to Broken Shores and get into a shop.  Then go back out...put the plane back on....fly out to the tower....and then NOT be able to get out of the plane again.  It only happened when the tower was within sight.  The third time I tried, I only flew part way and got out of the plane fine that time.  Very annoying.


(BTW: j/k about the NW tower.  It's some kind of bug.)

Ratty @ 12/6/2002 3:16:24 PM (75829):

Jonus @ 12/6/2002 4:33:14 PM (Myth about Reflect Shield breaking calms. 78283):
Well let me first say that i am playing an soldier. People demand from me that i should turn off my reflect shield as soon as i am joining their group. Why i asked a few times, and those folkes telling me that Reflect Shields break clams and make 'pets without masters' attack.

Well i am nearly lvl 100 and let me tell you that i have fought a lot of battles and most of them without RFS due to demand.

And there were a lot of robots, that still attacked after their master was dead and there were alot of enemies which broke their calms WITHOUT ANY Reflect Shield involved.

Then people say, "hey that was a bug" or "who idiot shoot at the pet".

Now if i turn on my reflect shield, the situation is total different, whenever some guy brakes his calm, i and my RFS are responsible, whenever a pet starts attacking without reason, the soldier is responible.

Let me add this, i am aware of the fact that Reflect Damage can sometimes break a calm, but i am not sure how that has created this hostile environment for RFSs.

Hey FC do something about it, it least tell those soldier bashers that we are not the cause of those problems.

Simply make reflect damage not aggroing.

Hypos @ 12/6/2002 6:25:26 PM (Already in combat? After returning from reclaim? 78317):
I was involved in trying to defend a tower that did not belong to my guild.  I was killed and returned from reclaim.  I figured I'd find the edge of the 25% zone and then buff up in the 75% area. 

As soon as I step into the 25% zone, I get attacked and killed by 2 players that must have been spamming the q button at me. Evidently, I didn't get a grace period when returning to the 25% zone because I was "already in combat". 

Now, I had saved in Clon**** and the fighting was in Broken Shores. So I zoned twice after reclaim. 


To my knowledge, I did not attack the towers. I was defending a tower of my faction and the area was 25%, not yet 5%.  I was teamed at the time, but since the area was 25%, I doubt anyone on my team could have attacked the tower.

I did make a point of selecting myself to look at my name. I did not see the ** marking. Since my guild also has towers, I don't think I'm supposed to ever get that marking. 

But I definitely got a message that said there was no grace period because I was already in combat.

Specialone @ 12/6/2002 7:29:02 PM (Can't complete mission - LAND control area INSIDE! 78330):
ROlled a mision in SFH yesterday - don't have exact coords but it is just NE from SFH 7L fixergrid exit, 2xxx-7xx if I recall - the area has a Birm Land Control - unoccupied message tagged to it. Large yellow rocky outcropping.

After entering the mission, I continued to occasionally get the same land Control area Birm messages. It was a pick-up item mission, not return type - when I got the item, nothing happened.

I tried dropping it, picking it up again, rezoning, gridding and returning, logging and relogging both in and outside mission, dropping and repicking up item every time and nothing worked. I logged after a few hours and again dropped the item and proceeded to kill all the mobs (I had blitzed it the 1st time) and after 15min the place was clear but my pick-up item had apparently timed out and disappeared...which I should have expected but didn't think of lol.

My 2 petitions "timed out" because I apparently have to remain in-game for more than 3 hours for FC to get to me...

Anyway, has anyone else experienced this? The mission has obviously timed out since and I don't mind rolling up another nano...so I'm not looking for recourse.

dropcid @ 12/6/2002 7:33:32 PM (Please get rid of the "land control" message INSIDE missions 78335):

OK here it is someone please help .. eversince ive installed NW i have not been able to log onto my account and get in game with the characters that ive zoned with.. there was my doc character that i was able to get on with and petition for a GM's help , ive also tried reinstalling the entire AO program and NW along with it and that did not help either.. Anyway when i got a hold of a GM in game with my doctor character he told me to log off and that he would warp all my characters to one area. i chose borealis since theres less lag there and after 20 mins i tryed logging back on with my other characters and was still not able too.. then i logged on with my doctor and was able to.. so *BIG MISTAKE* i tried zoning out of the store which is where my doctor was logged, and then i never zoned out and my PC froze .. i had to do a hard reboot and then tryed getting online again and guess what now i cannot get on with any of my characters...when i try logging in i get stuck on the AO icon screen where at the bottom it says Anarchy Online is loading..., and if i wait 3mins to 2hours it never actually launches the game..it stays right where it is, also since i did a reinstall and have not changed the settings in game i have the music option going, so i can here the music and it is definately stuck in a loop everytime i try logging in ..  WHAT IS GOING ON FUNCOM.. im now paying for a game that i cannot play because i cannot get online ...i think im going to try going over a friends house and logging in on his PC through his game setup and see what happens.. =[

That could be it.  I was in a team.  I've no idea if they were fighting at the time.

Hypos @ 12/6/2002 9:53:23 PM (78330):
Hmm, that's a new twist.  When you were outside the mission dropping the item and picking it up, did you ever try it outside the land control area?

Here's another possibility.  Did you have any other keys in your inventory?  I'm wondering if you were in a previously expired mission by mistake.

Or maybe it was a team mission and you weren't the mission holder?

Or, um... any chance it could have been a "return item" mission instead of a "find item" mission?

Hypos @ 12/6/2002 10:01:04 PM (78323):
Yep, lots and lots of pet pathing problems.  I suspect that "just noticed" is an understatement.

DizzyDean @ 12/6/2002 10:34:06 PM (78335):

Rulex @ 12/7/2002 8:32:25 AM (Bug when selling 78533):
Hello 
I was just in omni Ent and i figured I'd see how much money I could get for my nanos in the bank, I traded them all and saw that i was able to get about 1.96 mil for them, so cool then i hit decline and walk out, but then i looked in my inventory and well i was missing alot of them. Instead of filling the bags they went staight in my many inv, I only had 10 or so free, so the others just disappeared. That sucks, there should either be a overflow box, or they should fill the empty spaces in the orginal bag. I sold the rest anyway and yes i was out, only got 1.2 mil, i was out 700k, so i lost about 5-6 nanos , and i don't know the names
  Has this happened to anyone else????

Jayde @ 12/8/2002 8:39:29 AM (Please fix these various neutral teaming bugs! 78846):
Come on fellahs... It's been a while now, and the neutral teaming bugs are really getting tiresome.

I don't even get rewards any more, because teams have to roll the missions in advance. Since I should be getting 1 million XP reward from most of these, that's a pretty big deal. Not to mention the hassle of key duplication and not knowing where the mission is.

Also, PvP with mixed teams is still bugged.

Let's say, for instance... Team of 3 Omni and 2 neuts. (Happened to me a few days ago)

Team Side: Omni

As a neutral in "Omni" team I cannot:
-Heal Omni players ("Cannot help other side of conflict blah blah")
-Heal Neutral players ("Cannot help other side of conflict blah blah")
-Heal Clan players ("Cannot help other side of conflict blah blah")

As a neutral in "Omni" team I can:
-Be attacked by Omni players
-Be attacked by Neutral players
-Be attacked by Clan players

In addition to rolling neutral missions, right now the whole team side thing is totally screwed.

If the team side is Omni, Omni missions should be rolled, I should be able to heal other Omni teams, and other Omni players should be unable to attack members of an Omni team.

Not only is this needlessly causing many problems regarding tower defense, but it is really killing my ability to mission--and thus gain XP. So, if I can't PvP, and I can't team PvM... very little options are available to me.

Please fix the teaming bugs ASAP. Neutrals may not be the biggest faction on the block, but there are enough of us (and sided friends that are affected!) to warrant such a big bug to be fixed with some urgency.

aiwass777 @ 12/8/2002 3:18:56 PM (air-distance bug? 78937):
I believe that there are some bugs in distance is calculated when one part of the equasion is in the air (jumping).

In a mission yesterday, I had rooted a melee mob and ran back (~20m) out of range to shoot at it. I managed to get an obstacle between myself and the target so I jumped to clear line of sight. To my surprise I was hit.

I stopped and watched the mob. It was still rooted and could not hit me if I did not jump. Yet each subsequent time I jumped I was hit by the mob.

This may also explain how I managed to get rooted from a altitude of over 40 meters a few days back. Jump-casting works in the game (tested), even though you get a message that casting isn't possible while falling.

I can't believe this was not fixed in the last fix patch.

As if it was not already hard for neutrals to get xp.


I guess this is another stealth directive by FC to do away with neutrals.

This will not end if they fix the bug, it will remain in peoples minds and neutrals will find it harder to find teams.


When will they realise that the harder they make it for us, the more we will stick together.

luxferro @ 12/9/2002 6:04:24 AM (****Tower Bug**** 79166):
Okay here is my problem.

My crat Vilis left Tempest, she had 2 towers there, created before she left. Now Vilis has joined Storm. I can't build towers, cause my old ones didn't self destruct or dissapear after i left the org. So i fly back to see if i can self terminate them. No good, says i don't have the rank of the person who created them (or something like that..).


I petitioned over 3 hours ago... nothing.. i went from #50 to like #8 in this 3 hours with a petition classified as a bug, that supposedly has the highest priority... or so the petition thingy told me.

This is not right, especailly after i just answered a survey to a ARK about the petition service. I take back any nice things i may have said. i shouldn't have to sit online all night to wait for some help. and my petition description should be enough to tip the ARK/GM on the other end what the problem is so i don't have to be awake all night staring at a monitor waiting :\

Okay,  i see one non easy way to fix the problem. get re-recruited  and repromoted into Tempest so i can hopefully destroy the towers... this is not an easy task as i was general and the president isn't online much when i am... and is a inconvienence to me. what if i left a guild on bad terms?

Fix this please!!!

Phione @ 12/9/2002 6:17:25 AM (PvP Point System isn't working in team... 79169):
It's not working as stated in the Patch Note.

When you are in a team, you will not get any PvP point when you kill your opponent (so far, if your opponent isn't in a team, you'll 100% not get the point, havn't tried if both are in teams tho...)

I thought this was changed in the patch, which allows players to gain/lose pvp points regardless if they're in a team or not.

Now, I've sent mail to Cz regarding this issue, but so far I havn't receive any answer.

yes, I finished the mission. The reward wasn't in a corner, so I had a little trouble finding it, but I did manage to finish.
It wouldn't be a real big deal if I was fighting through the mission, but something about having this text flashing in the center of my screen makes it really hard to pay attention while running.

Sethil @ 12/9/2002 6:00:47 PM (Reflect shields need a bugfix 79332):
We all know, reflect shields like RRFe take away several % of the incoming damage. But are shield really right calculated?
Lets have an example:

A character with 5000 HP, 5000 AC (in all classes) and buffed with RRFe (30%)
Now, someone shoots at him and the incoming damage is 6000 in PvP (AS, Crits and FA would make that possible). We know, a character can take only 40% damage of his HP, that would reduce the damage to 2000. We all know, a character with 5000 HP can take 2000 damage without wearing RRFe, which means, the AC is already taken from the incoming damage before the 40% check takes effect.
This means we have the following order to this point:

1. Incoming damage = 6000
2. Check for 50% PvP = 3000 (which could be a part of 1. or it is right from the beginning only 50%, which doesnt make a difference)
3. reduce damage by AC = 2500
4. check for 40% limit = 2000

But we all know, a reflect shield can reduce also the 40%-capped damage, so the next point is:

5. RRFe = 1400 The last point

1400 is the right value for this character. So, but what is wrong now? Did you ever looked at a Soldier casting his shield? The shield appears like a ball around him and that is like a shied should be - a protective field around him. But RRFe is for sure the last point in the list.

Next example:

1. Incoming damage = 2000
2. Check for 50% PvP = 1000 
3. reduce damage by AC = 500
4. check for 40% limit = 500
5. RRFe = 350

350 is the remaining damage from the incoming 1000 - ok....
But should be the shield the last point? As far as know, shields are around the armor and they are the first, an incoming damage have to pass by and then AC.
The logical right order in this case should be either (high damage in big letters):

A:
1. Incoming damage = 2000 (6000)
2. Check for 50% PvP = 1000 (3000)
3. check for 40% limit = 1000 (2000)
4. RRFe = 700 (1400)
5. reduce damage by AC = 200 (900)

or

B:
1. Incoming damage = 2000 (6000)
2. Check for 50% PvP = 1000 (3000)
3. RRFe = 700 (2100)
4. reduce damage by AC = 200 (1600)
5. check for 40% limit = 200 (1600)

or

C:
1. Incoming damage = 2000 (6000)
2. Check for 50% PvP = 1000 (3000)
3. RRFe = 700 (2100)
4. check for 40% limit = 700 (2000)
5. reduce damage by AC = 200 (1500)

As you see in all 3 cases, the low damage is lower (in every case 200) than it actually is (350 now). 
But in the highdamage range, where the 40% cap hits, it could happen that it is either much lower (900) or in 2 cases a little bit higher (1500/1600). The only question here is.... where in this order comes the 40% cap?
But we all should agree, damage should pass first the shields, then the AC.

Ok, FunCom - Fix it pls.

Darkbane @ 12/9/2002 7:22:24 PM (75829):
Yes, 20% I think it was as a maximum, split up according to how many areas a side controls in relation to the total available.

You know how you go into an area under land control, and it says

"Land (whatever) Controller:None"?

It says this in missions. Every 5 seconds or so. In the middle of my screen. Like i said, it's a silly thing to whine about, but it is very annoying.

Jayde @ 12/9/2002 8:14:49 PM (78846):
Well, considering most sided folk have a +15% XP bonus from Towers and 1000 Token Board, they're gaining levels faster than ever... With an XP ring and Baton, that's a good 20%+ XP bonus with little to no effort..

Right now, most neutrals are having a hard time getting XP at all.

Even better, the new "camps" for getting the tower quest items drop Bravery Tokens almost every other mob--and each quest gives a mission token every time. Assuring that any sided person who doesn't have a 100 board yet who is of decent level can get one rather easily.

But, this is beside the point... The two issues I mentioned--both with missions and PvP--are BUGS and should be fixed ASAP.

I looked at me, a clanner and a neut up in Mort, found a calculator, added all 3 %s, and got 19,93% total. Assuming there are some uncontrolled places, it adds up to 20%. Or at least it's close enough.

Yep, that's what i had to do. But i was a general, so only the president could do it. We live in different time zones, so it was hard to get a hold of him when i was on.

Either way, i don't think this should happen.

For Example, not that this would happen to me, but lets just say you join an org, build some towers on their land, after a few days they decide that you are a jerk, they give ya the boot. Now they got your towers defending their land controller, and when you join a new org, you can't make new ones..lol.. exploit??

coldwarkid @ 12/11/2002 2:30:50 PM (78283):
Damage is only reflected back onto the attacker though, not onto all mobs in the vicinity. Calmed mobs don't attack, so a reflect shield should make no difference.

However, reflects can still cause problems because mobs sometimes get in one last attack after the calm lands. In this case, the mob is technically already calmed (even though it just hit you) and if its fighting target has a reflect shield on the calm will break.

As for making mob pets attack after their master has been killed, that used to happen but doesn't any more. I found this out when I was forced to TMS in a fight with an Engineer mob, which reflected a good three or four hits onto the bot. However, once the caster had been dealt with, Sparky went quiet instead of continuing to attack me. Obviously one instance could be a bug, so I cast a long-duration reflect and did some testing. No pet that I was able to find continued to attack because of reflected damage.

Cheers,

Any Omnis can attack me, and I cannot heal Omnis. This is WRONG, if it is team-side Omni, it should be that way.

Even worse, none of the Omni players in the team can assist me if an Omni attacks me. They are unable to attack Omni players no matter what--even if one is currently attacking one of their team members.

Furthermore, I basically can buff/assist NOBODY outside my team. I cannot heal/buff Neutrals OR Omni...and of course not Clan.

If this game is going to be PvP oriented, bugs like this cannot exist. Neutrals in mixed teams are totally worthless in PvP right now.

Um, I play an NT, I don't know if I think that anti-GA nuke is a good idea. (I do know that GA looks stupid, is badly moddled and textured though)

However, IMHO all Hoops is saying is that the DESCRIPTION is "bugged" in that the number displayed is double the number displayed in all other (nanocrystal) cases.

I don't believe he's asking for a nerf. Just an update to the description OR and update to the nano damage such that it matches the description.

alphane @ 12/12/2002 3:44:05 PM (Unexpected mission behaviour 80495):
last night we rolled a team mission with one of my guildmates in Tir, QL 26. We are both around level 16. I play a trader (a bit tweaked) with approximatively 500 AC (carbonum QL 24).
What's happend is that every mob we met in the mission was unaffected at all by our buffs.

1) Neither my deprive nor ransack lowered their fire power.
2) Usually i can evade some of the attacks, in that case no evade at all was available. i was hit each time (between 22 and 36 depending of the mob)
3) their rate of fire was less than one second and my armour AC seemed to be inneficient against their attack.

We finaly went out ,unable to progress into the mission. My teamate logged his Enforcer lvl 105 and he entered the mission with his full buffs. Against the same mobs he never evaded a single shot and was hit each time around 36 dmgs.

I would like to know if someone else experienced such a problem in team or solo mission. unfortunately it was too late for us to file a petition.

Romaker @ 12/12/2002 5:02:54 PM (***tower Bug Read*** 80533):
Not sure if this was mentioned but our guild Opposing Force Conquered a land control area in Andromeda so we built our own there and within 10hours we had the place loaded with 36towers.  Well next day we get warning of being attacked so we defend and hold it off for 2hours no problems at all when all of a sudden a lvl 155 Omni Efnorcer decides to Exploit a bug and he started taking our tower out.  Now tihnk about this a miniute the tower is QL 50.  Yet he still was able to attack and destroy it.

None of it would have happened if he couldnt attack it and when I sene he was doing so I went to get my 147 Soldier Kunn on which I know would have pumled in in seconds but no time.  Comp crashes Hard Drive gone however has nothing to do with the situation.  So I say if the bug is not fixed ASAP then I suggest you classify it as non exploit so that all of us lvl 150+ in OP4 can at least get permission to go back to our rightfully and legilty claimed land and take it back.

Please respnod if anyone else has had this problem.  I will get the name of the guild that exploited it and put it here so you can all add them to your KOS list  as I already got them on mine and will be happy to abide by killing them every time I see them.

that bug has been around since beta and was very easy to do back then however the old way does not work now.  Back in beta we would do outdoor hunting with a team of about 12-20 everyday it was awsome and fun but risky as with so many people the lag was horrible.  All yu did back then was make team one person LD reqruit new one ld again another new one and when everyone was logged in they had team chat and got team heals and xp however did not show in team

Slicse @ 12/12/2002 6:31:52 PM (75264):

And even better than before. Now that neutrals take the side of the other members in the team, they pull missions with only mobs of different sides. Meaning tabbing is much less of a problem.

I'm sorry but if your teamed with an Omni for the purpose of PvP, then you are no longer neutral.  I doubt this is a bug, more of a way of telling you that your alignment doesn't fit with what you are actually doing.

Don't get me wrong here, I fully support the neutral activities and wish that there were more options for neutrals, but that is not a neutral activity.

The team was all Omni (I've checked this from the bios on the screenshots).

The boss was neutral for some reason and the bodyguards clan. We zoned up were being owned, the bodyguards were calmed and we all zoned out. Next thing we knew the bodyguards had broken their calms, we zoned back up and the boss and bodyguards were busy duelling it out.

Understandably we left them to it. 

By the time the boss had finished the bodyguards off he was down to half health and gave us little problem.

You are wrong.

You obviously don't have a very good grasp on what being Neutral is. I'm guessing you aren't one.

It's not a bug. If we were supposed to be "neutral" in PvP, THEN IT SHOULD BE TEAM SIDE NEUTRAL STILL.

It's not. It's Team Side: Omni. As long as I'm being TOLD by Funcom that I am in an Omni team because I have teamed with some Omni buddies, I expect it to work correctly.

Also, you are ignoring the underlying technical issues here.

I CANNOT HEAL OMNI, NEUTRAL, OR CLAN CHARACTERS OUTSIDE MY TEAM--PERIOD.

Yes. I cannot buff *anyone* outside my team at all. If I'm Neutral, fine. Make it so I can buff other Neutrals. If it's Team Side: Omni, then I should be able to buff Omnis.

My point is, I don't really care which side it is, but it's totally bugged right now. I cannot heal anyone outside my team just because I am teamed with someone else.

Also, how do you deem what is a Neutral activity?

Scenario:
- Neutral mining complex is under attack from Clanners
- Neutral guild calls on a few close Omni friends to help them defend their base
- Neutrals teamed with the Omni cannot heal either the other Neutral or the other Omni on the playing field
- Neutrals not teamed with the Omni cannot heal the Omni in the team, OR the Neutral in the team
- Neutrals can attack the Omni in the team with the Neutral
- Omni can attack Neutrals in the team with the Omni
- Nobody in the mixed team can reliate against attackers that are the same side as them, even if provoked.

Scenario:
- 1 Neutral and 1 Clanner helping each other kill Cyborgs enter a 25% zone
- Team side is Clan
- Clan member can attack Neutral member in "Clan" team
- Clan friend cannot retaliate for the ganking of his friend at all

There are so many mix-ups in the above scenarios, it's laughable.

I am not saying one way or the other should be correct... However, it *needs* to be ONE way or the OTHER. Right now, it's a mix of both, and Neutrals are getting the short end of the stick.

1) No retliation capabilities for teammates
2) Inability for Neutrals in mixed teams to assist *anyone* outside their team (Seriously...try it. You cannot help ANYONE, period.)
3) Neutrals being attackable by their "team side"
4) Different members in the same team having different sets of PvP rules (just makes for tons of confusion)

Don't try to justify these huge bugs with "Neutrals shouldn't be doing X" crap. This applies to all PvP situations, not just offensive ones. Neutrals can fully operate in defensive or special situations without losing their Neutrality. Again, I don't need some sided player telling me how I should play my character. Stick to your own and I'm pretty sure Neutrals can figure out their identity for themselves, thanks.

PvP is a lot more encompassing (especially nowadays) than just attacking someone else. Neutral PvP was enabled to make sure we could protect our bases, and enlisting the help of kind individuals from various sides to protect agains the opposite side is perfectly, 100% resonable.

Uberling @ 12/13/2002 6:18:45 AM (How to Reproduce Yalm unequip bug. 80794):
Must be fixer with ability to grid yourself, must have Yalm and Yatamutchy Movement Predictor (which you can equip).

While you in Yalm, zone into mission or shop, right-click Yatamutchy Movement Predictor (YMP) to unequip Yalm. Cast your grid evac nano, exit grid and right click Yalm to equip it. It's all. Now you can't unequip Yalm without zoning.

How to cure: With Yalm in your pack (affected by that bug you will be in fly mode still), zone (whompah or zone border), equip Yalm, zone back. Now all must work as FC intended 

P. S. Probably you can Reproduce that bug even if you arn't fixer, but in team with fixer which will cast Group grid evac.

I created a new char, but when I got to the part where you choose a side, I just ran down a hall without stopping to talk to the chars there.  It let me zone into a backyard.  But once there, I was unable to access either my inventory or the skills system.  The game said I could not do those things until I had chosen a side.

Either the game should not allow zoning before a side is chosen, or the side should automatically be assigned when you zone.

[edit] went back and deleted the char (easier than waiting on a petition).  The second time, I specifically talked to the guy at the desk, but there wasn't a choice to sign up.  Fortunately, it worked this time.  Maybe the bug occurs if you step through without talking to anyone first?  When I had the bug, I talked to the lady at the rope line, but that's it.

Ratty @ 12/13/2002 9:36:43 AM (75264):
Excellent.
Now all that's left is fix it so if you're teamed with someone, you can't tab to them, then teaming will be perfect. I havnet used tab in missions... ever.. in this game, would be nice if they fixed it. As a neutral, hitting tab cycles through the entire team usually. And even in a neutral team, neutral mobs wont show up in tab, so even then, tab is useless.

Faithslayer @ 12/13/2002 10:16:35 AM (The 3 new tower buttons in the map 80843):
I've only just bought notum wars, and i havent investigated tower building yet (as i'm only level 8  but, say i open the map (ctrl+4) then close it again, then for example press ctrl+1. if i hold shift to inspect my leg armour, one of the 3 buttons will appear, also if i move left to right with the mouse, the other 2 will turn up, it's more annoying than anything else because it doesnt totaly cover anything and they go away once ctrl+1 is pressed again

bananana @ 12/13/2002 11:19:30 AM (lost items and credits when server went down to patch 80861):
bleh.. transferred 41mill credits and a backpack full of armor right before the patch and couldent log out after that since i couldent unequip my yalm, got thrown out when servers went down for patching, and when it comes back up, no credits and no backpack :/

[Edit]: We even got XP when the boss killed a guard, lol.

Yep, I've seen the lag warpage is missions too. Another annoying little feature.

ForeverNyt @ 12/13/2002 3:33:00 PM (Yalm paint bug/Black doors 80932):
I have what used to be a ql 95 yalm and I just bought red paint for it.  When I go to apply the paint, it tells me the ql of the yalm is too low, needs to be ql 130 or more. Can I get a GM or someone to swap me a painted red ql 95 yalm in place of the bugged paint? I hate to think I just blew 10 mil creds on nothing. 

Also, experienced the black doors in missions the other night, after the patch that was supposed to fix it.

And one final note, what kind of a run speed bonus do the poniard yalms give? Nothing is listed in the description.

Slicse @ 12/13/2002 3:33:53 PM (80367):
Nobody pays attention to these kinds of posts anyway. All they do is see the word "neutral" in the same post as a (legitimate) complaint then they get all offended and want to anti-neutral preach

Engelen @ 12/13/2002 3:42:56 PM (80810):
I had the same problem! I created a new character today, came to the hall....talked to the old geezer(he`s tha bomb), and then the informer on the Omni Side...I came into the backyard...and no side.

But hey, I still got Side XP bonus!

Liyanne @ 12/13/2002 4:57:45 PM (80197):
I've not only had the similar problem frequently on missions, but also when travelling outdoors. Rater annoying to get teleported back after every 10 seconds, moving nowhere as a result. Especially annoying if a (standard) mob is hitting you all the time and smiling gleefully when there's no place to run.

I've tried on four different occasions to petition for an ARK to check it out, but have never gotten a reply and each of those petitions have timeouted in due time without anyone paying any attention to them, at least to my knowledge.

Hypos @ 12/13/2002 5:20:23 PM (80810):
I made an effort to reproduce this problem, but couldn't.  The only thing I remember being odd about the time the bug occurred was that it took longer than normal for me to zone into the backyard.

Hypos @ 12/13/2002 5:24:30 PM (80739):
Heh, haven't seen that one before.  I'm wondering if you were in a land control area.  Were you getting the "this area controlled by..." message as you moved around?

Autocratt @ 12/13/2002 5:32:06 PM (de-Yalming when I zone 80964):
Veh Air Req is 123, I show 124.

I can equip it no problem but when I zone it stays equipped but I am not in the Yalm. (Sounds like another old bug that has arisen again thanks to the patch.)

The only thing I can think of is that I am using a Deformed Mantidae Mandibles which adds 15 Veh Air and upon zoning it simply is not counted towards the Veh Air req.

Thanks for investigating.

don't know if its a "Bug" but it should be changed.

You can't stack a equal ql, same type specal attack arrow.  pain in the butt concidering each 'pack' contains only 10 arrows.

Not sure if this is a bug, but I'll post it anyway.

Executing Nano Program: Instill With Fury. 
You are not allowed to execute a friendly nanoprogram on this target here! Pvp level restrictions apply on healing/friendly nanos in Land Control areas.

It didn't take any outside buffs or implant stepping to get this pet btw. It's just the normal pet for a MP this level.

Toxinator @ 12/14/2002 2:26:47 PM (81261):
Guess funcom didnt think bout that when they made these stupid restrictions.

Engelen @ 12/14/2002 3:40:24 PM (Black Doors/Horrible Pull backs/more 81281):
There seem to be more problems than ever. This is getting quite tiresome, as we are promised fixes, but they dont work. 

-Black Doors are still there, as bad as ever.
-The Pull back bug is horrible, and has been here for quite some time now...if you try to run forward, you are sent back to where you started. This can loop itself 3-4 times..and it is very, very bad for gameplay. 
-Sudden stops, maybe lagspikes. Lets say you are in a fight. suddenly all interactions stops, the only thing happening is you and your enemy hitting eachother, but no damage. Nothing. Until a minute later, which I have found my self dead on the ground, xp lost. This has happened for a while now, and all these things are happening to my buds too. So dont come with a weak explanation of my computer being the problem.

This is top prio Funcom.

Shodu @ 12/15/2002 12:54:05 AM (Fix Black Doors Now!!! 81425):
Go back to whatever your previous code was because your "fix" of black doors does not work. I have been to 3 missions today and in each missions i encountered black doors and had to relog. This is not good for team sprit!

And while you are at it, fix the grid because I get bumped half the time I go into it.

Shodu @ 12/15/2002 1:55:15 AM (Exploits at Primus Camp in EFP. 81440):
I am naturally not going into detaits about how this is done, because I really don't know, but when to regular players (level <175, they were a certain shade of green to me) take down a Primus Bully on their own, then there has to be something wrong (IMHO.) -- but then again it could be that they were utterly uber.

I just thought this should be looked into.

Shodu @ 12/15/2002 1:58:39 AM (Grid Crashes.. 81441):
I don't know how many times I have crashed whilst trying to zone into the grid today, but they are more than they used to be. This is particulary annoying when you are trying to manage and keep together a team. We Omnis often wanna use the grid to get to BS from Newland.

Jayde @ 12/15/2002 7:55:04 AM (80367):
Bump.. 

Believe it or not, this is a really serious issue due to many applications. (Both for AND against Neutrals. So all the Sided bigots out there should know that this setup can be used against you as well... think sided Doc in Neutral team while you're attacking Neutrals, who is free to heal but never attackable by you. Heh.)

agentgimpy @ 12/15/2002 10:02:22 PM (80924):
I have found this to be not a general problem, but specific to the Tir south gate. Three times this has happened to me and every time it was that gate. I now whompa to Athen and take the grid for there. In fact to be more specific it seems now that I think of it I have been heading out of Tir each time as well. 

Where did this happen to you?

Very annoying when you are on a schedual and have to wait for 10-15mins before you can log back on.

agentgimpy @ 12/15/2002 10:07:14 PM (81281):
"Rubber banding" very, very, annoying and lately way, way more common. Hope they are looking into this one.

Inconvenience @ 12/16/2002 1:45:51 AM (72898):
Hoops, chill out. Just think of the dumb replies as bumps.

I know this is a bug report not an opinion thread on the nano but it's turned into that anyway so...

(not directed at hoops)

Most NT's I know didn't want the nanos and still dont. 

We wanted a nano that does good damage has a resonable recharge and around a 50-60% NR so that it will actually land on mobs and people.

High level fixers with grid armor mk4 were NOT wiped accross the arena by nt's. With 1084 MC I could only land 1/3 nukes against a grid armor fixer at full deff with maxed nr. Combine that with hot's and MCS burst recharge and I would not consider Fixer vs. NT to be so one sided before this nuke. We as nt's want to do more damage against EVERYONE not just fixers. 

I'll stop ranting now. 

Sorry Hoops for the rant , I aggree that the fixer nukes are half-a@# dimwitted non-content. 

Consider this a bump and not a rant...

Evilspork @ 12/16/2002 1:48:58 AM ('sploiting mobs 81754):
I've been doing a lot of outside hunting lately in dynacamps, and here are some really nasty things I've observed that mobs do:

- When in the presence of a boss mob you get errors when trying to cast nanos, mostly the "you are already casting" message. Sometimes you can fix this for one cast by taking a step back and trying to cast again. I'm a fixer, not really a casting class, and this is a big PITA for even me. I was teaming with an NT the other day, and she was pretty much castrated because she couldn't nuke, calm, root, or anything until I told her how to fix it.

- Mobs in general warp to your position from 40m+ away. Sure, fine, people exploit by whatever yadda yadda yadda when you're standing somewhere mobs can't normally get to. But when you're trying to run away? That is total BS, the valid survival tactic of advancing in the opposite direction shouldn't be taken away by a band-aid fix implimented by some lazy dev.

- Meelee mobs still double hit. If they hit you, you see two shots of damage. If I evade, I only see one evade message instead of two.

- Nothing dangerous, but weird. Meelee monster mobs (haven't seen any human mobs for a while) use random ranged weapon effects and sounds, while still being meelee range. The type will change during a fight, it's not a specific weapon type used by all mobs. I've seen snakes that have chunkprojector visual effects and shotgun sounds, 34-IIs with SMG blasts, etc.

BurntToast1 @ 12/16/2002 5:15:09 AM (943):
Pets keep the "in a fight" tag after a fight or after dieing.

This prevents me from adding/joining a team, does not go away when I log, goes away when the pet is dead/ terminated.

Paene_Nant @ 12/16/2002 9:41:51 AM (80924):

Paene_Nant @ 12/16/2002 9:46:57 AM (80843):
I have the same problem - I experience it trying to click off buffs in my running nanos window. I cant click on them cox the buttons from map are there (even tho my map is closed).

I have to open my map window and close it again so I can kill the buffs.

Plz fix this soon!

It's perhaps just mine and my friends computers too,
cuz we have the exact same problems. Eighter if both
computers is hooked up in my house, and share ADSL,
or he at home, with ISDN..
Oh.. And my friend just bought a brand new Siemens N.
2 gightz high-end system..
..Guess Siemens have the same problems with they're computers...

Well..
This game makes me swet every time I play..
-"When will i "rubber-band?"
- "When will i get "server lost" again?"

..I allmost every times play solo, cuz team-up makes
it hopeless. I LD all the time..
Outdoor-hunting at vb was a little tiny better than solo-
mission, but I LD'ed there too.. "But no rubber-band" tho.

Why can't FC do some soon?

Atleast answer us.. "Yes we know the problem, and
are working on it.."
That would have made alot of people smile, just because
you show you care.. But you don't. ..Do you?

1000101 @ 12/16/2002 11:05:21 PM (BUG: Phantom Tower 82110):
I have a phantom tower: a tower I placed, later vanished, but still counts as active.

Data for your devs:
  RK2 ( rimor )
  Omni
  Bigstupid, lv 148

Dates are estimates:
Dec 3: I placed 2 towers in a zone in MilkyWay controled by Project EDEN.
	1 guardian tower and 1 Turret tower.

Dec 5: Upon Login I received a system message that my guardian tower was destroyed
	I visited the area and the guardian tower was gone.
	I had not /tower terminated
	No one in my guild had /tower terminated
	None of our towers were attacked, including my guardian tower.
	...Basicly, it just vanished.
	When I attempted to place a replacement guardian tower, I was unable to as I "was not powerful enough to control 3 towers"
	When I hit F8 and Id myself, It shows that I stil control the phantom guardian tower.
	
	Note that my 1 Turret tower was uneffected by all of this.

Dec 13: My Turret tower was destroyed in a raid.
	I now have no towers but my Id still claims I have the phantom guardian tower.

Dec 15: I quit Project EDEN
	I join Shadow Ops
	I place a new Turret Tower in a Shadow Ops controled area.
	This brings my tower count up to 2 (1 real + 1 phantom)

I cant /tower terminate.  Because to do that would require targeting my phantom tower.
I cant build a replacement as AO thinks I still control this phantom tower.
Ive asked 2 ARKs and 1 GM.  (All of 3 have been wonderful and promised to hunt down my phantom tower and kill it)
I just wanted to pass this on to your devs so they can fix it before it becomes an issue for others.

Canto @ 12/16/2002 11:37:52 PM (82010):
Yes is getting worse with every patch.  Now I warp 15-20 times per mission and black doors once every 2 missions instead of once every 3.

cold @ 12/17/2002 2:59:36 AM (Yalm unequips when zoning 82190):
On my trader, my yalm unequips every time I zone. I suspect this has to do with the Barter Armor pants and the Mantidae Mandibles (trader item), which both boost Vehicle Air. Without these 2 items I do not meet the requirements.

edit- confirmed. If I meet the skill requirements without these 2 items, they yalm will stay on.

luxferro @ 12/17/2002 4:10:22 AM (80794):

There seems to be a problem with leaving Tir at the South Gate, best just to stay away from that place and find a new way out or result in a crash-loop.

Kallid @ 12/17/2002 5:42:52 AM (80964):
This has happened to me too, I believe it is due to the dribble down effect during zoning, where your stats on your armor are added after it determines if you have enough Vechicle Air.  Simple and quick fix is to just put a couple more IP points into Vechicle Air.  About 5-10 will do it.

Actually, you need about 4-5 points more in veh. air than req, to not unequip yalm on zoning.  At least I did, was using 2 Flying imps at the time.

Bothead @ 12/17/2002 12:14:17 PM (80964):
Don't bother putting IP into veh. air, get a couple of lvls maxing Int and Sense should do the trick. 4-5 extra point in veh. air will keep the yalm on.

Until a minute later, which I have found my self dead on the ground, xp lost. This has happened for a while now, and all these things are happening to my buds too. So dont come with a weak explanation of my computer being the problem.

This last patch was the icing on the cake.  Not only am I warping in missions much worse, but last night I warped from Tir West gate all the way back to Tir South Gate.. *sigh*

I was only back in Tir because I hit reclaim due to the warping in my mission.  I got disgusted and just logged off..

This bug is in game for months.
Got my L44 NT killed because of this, letting me lose 50% of my level worth of exp.

1000101 @ 12/17/2002 5:53:38 PM (80794):
Could it be that having a nano cast during the yalm unequip will cause the bug?
I noticed that I often play with a doc and i often have a HoT running.  Last night was the case and the HoT did its thing during my unyalming (is that a word?).  And I got the bug.

1000101 @ 12/17/2002 5:55:02 PM (80794):
I noticed that you can resolve the bug this way:
/quit
wait until you actually drop from the server (about 60 seconds)
relog

if you /quit and relog before you drop, you will still be in the yalm

Same here, the week before last I hacked an ES graft and it remained Agent even when the description was correct. I petitioned and the ARK said he'd report the bug. Another fixer told me he received info from the ARKs that it would be patched soon, that the hacked grafts would turn OK in my inventory (like just now happened to the Yalmaha paint cans). I've checked my graft every day or at least after every patch since then but it still is bugged. Or was yesterday anyway, will log in soon now and come back to correct the statement if things have changed...

Same day I hacked the ES a friend called to ask if I knew what was wrong with some other agent grafts that had the same bug. All the other profession specific ones I hacked that day were good. Also another ES graft I hacked earlier is still good, can't remember how many days or weeks earlier I did it but some time ago.

I'd like to be able to trust in my ability to hack an item someone asks me to do. Not fun giving a broken item back after several hours in /petition queue telling that it should be OK one day...

Naraya @ 12/17/2002 9:09:45 PM (72898):
With the advent of these nukes, Fixers everywhere are crying loudly and in my mind they are rightful in doing so.  These nukes should've never been implemented.  There is no balance in exclusively giving one profession the means to totally obliterate another.

Not to mention the fact that FunCom did say they wanted PvP fights to last longer (hence the 50% crit nerf) and then they give us nukes to make fights against GA Fixers faster?  Bass ackward if you ask me....

Yes, they disappear if you upload one you've already got. Makes no sense, but that's the way it is.

It's always been that way. Wouldn't hurt if they fixed it, though.

Ok devs, humor Hoops.

State that the spell help text has a typo and it should read xxx (2x the current amount) and then change the text to that 2x current amount.

Hoops happy then? It does half damage then compared to spell help as you wish... ofcourse nothing else would change.

On another note, as many have stated, it was not NT balancing nano, it was Fixer balancing nano.

Which you prefer? FC nerfs hell out of GA or even removes it from game altogether, along with this new NT nano... or things stay as they are?

Zarch and da chars

PS.

Each and everyone of my non fixer professions is willing to make a trade with you fixers. You can choose ANY nano you want from me and I get GA IV in return. I will loose the nano you chose and you will lose GA IV. Deal? I didnt think so...

bigswede @ 12/18/2002 2:51:55 PM (Fighting adds - Intended or bug? 82625):
After these latest patches I'm experiencing problems when facing multiple mobs. After killing the first one I can't attack the next one directly. I get a message saying something about "wait until the previous action has ended".

Now, this does not happen every time. Some times it works but mostly it is like this. This can be very annoying when youre in the midst of the battle and health is going down. Time is essential when fighting multiple mobs and sometimes I can just stand there for as long as 5-10 seconds before I'm able to attack the next mob, wich can be lethal in the end.

I've tried to test this a bit by not using brawl, fast attack or Flurry of blows. It may be the FOB or the specials that makes does this. I feel I should atleast be able to go in attack mode...
If I use autoattack it works, but I'm used to not have it on, since I dont want to automaticly attack mob pets etc.

So.. Is this intended or is it a bug?

Hello?

This has been reported in other threads as well.

It is very annoying and disruptive to have the "invisible" buttons actually be there (and function too!) even when the little map window is closed.

I was really hoping the last patch would fix it (since it was reported prior to that).  But it wasn't.

Could we at least get an acknowledgment that FC is aware of it?

Thanks,

NeckWringer @ 12/18/2002 9:17:19 PM (Bug with general weapons nano formulas 82729):
General weapons nano formulas do not increase ATTACK.

For instance if implanted attack skill is 344 attack is 344.
Cast specific class nano that increases weapons skill say 40 points and attack increases to 384. But if you use the general formula for the same weapon skill your attack will NOT increase 20 points as it should.

dropcid @ 12/18/2002 10:37:52 PM (Bug: movement predictors not working 82753):
Manex - 14m range
Y. Movement predictor, +24 range

should give me around 38m total range. 

at the same time, I have in a nano range increaser, capping my nanos at 40 range.

If I go to a backyard, root a leet, and then go to the max distance (40m, tested by casting other nanos on leet until "out of range"), I cannot shoot the leet until I close the distance by around half (i.e. approx 20 range).

Also tried unequipping my nano range increaser, found a nano with 20 range, gun has about the same range as the nano.

Reported it to an Ark and demonstrated in backyard, she said she'd let the bughunters know.

btw- I was not overequipped on the gun or movement predictor.

Would very much like to see this fixed- lots of wasted IPs on WS and perception.

-D

green-jello @ 12/19/2002 4:39:53 AM (82753):
correct me if i'm wrong but its impossible to reach max range with a gun under 20m.
the scope and movement predicters add a % of the base range to your gun
for instance, QL200 movement predictor = rangeinc weapon 50
would mean it adds 50% of the 14m on your manex
meaning QL200 movement predictor adds 7m to your manex (14 * .5(50%))
QL200 ellts adds 45 rangeinc weapon adding another 6.3m (not sure how fractions work)
so looks like the max you'll be getting is 27.3m (not sure how they round fractions though).
could get more with the rangeinc implants i suppose.
hope this helps

green-jello is right, the predictor adds %, so your +24 range adds 24% more range.

runey @ 12/19/2002 6:53:51 PM (82889):
Iirc, the second room type you show has a metal statue in it. Its normal "skin" is a sort of metal mesh, but sometimes the mesh doesn't load (the pink is the ambient lights reflecting on the base skin, I think) and sometimes it imprints nearby things (like your face or a mob's face) as a skin (like those wall blocks do sometimes). The first one...I've heard of the mob in a toilet before, but never seen it.

skybert @ 12/19/2002 6:59:26 PM (82889):
well, I was curious when I saw them at the first time. Tried to do anything to get a result (movement/attack/action). I ended up with concluding that they're part of the scenario. Just like any other stack of boxes, stones, plants, officedesks, chairs etc.

The guy with his head in the toilet is funny, but I don't know what to think of the pink guy. I guess he's just strange....

of course, a user-friendly option would be to link your tab targets to team side.
maybe neutrals would have a use for tab targeting with something like that (as my tab button is probably the least-used button on the keyboard as far as AO is concerned).

vespucci @ 12/21/2002 6:30:48 AM (Lost NPC timeouts 83515):
o.k.

We have all had this happen to us.  

You are on a mission and the NPC you are battling all of sudden runs the wrong way and gets lost.

You can't recharge your Nano you can't recharge your health.

It used to be that this would last for only a couple of minutes and then timeout.  Now, with the latest patch, it seems as though we have taken a few steps backward since you have to zone and loose your maps before you can use your nano and treatment packs.

As long as we have NPC pathing issues Funcom really needs to bring back the timeout.

vespucci @ 12/21/2002 6:42:58 AM (82889):

Ratty @ 12/21/2002 10:57:20 AM (75264):
I never use tab anymore either. Even on an all neutral team, you get neutral mobs in missions, so no matter what you get the FC servicing (if anyone remembers George Carlin talking about "servicing the customer").

They need to fire that power tripping designer that insists on neutral being a side only for newbies, that is only played until they "pick a side". If that's Gaute, they need to frigging get rid of him, and put someone in there that can handle what the players do and work with it instead of trying to get everyone to fit into his little vision of what he wants us playing 'his' game.

Is it only obvious to me that the only reason neutrals can build towers at all is to increase NW sales? I'm sure they don't even want us to build towers at all, so they just put us in the battle, 10% versus both sides, so of course they both roll up on us and take all our towers right away without much resistance (from gimped players with no token boards, special armor, etc).

I think as time goes on things will just get more and more hard on us, that is, until we just leave and play another MMORPG, then FC can do what they want with this game.  With so many other MMO games to choose from, one is bound to be as good as AO on all the other great things about this game, but maybe without amazingly bad design decisions that only make the counterstrike pvp kiddies happy.

Evilspork @ 12/21/2002 6:22:06 PM (NCU Buffs 83618):
I don't know about most fixers, but I and a couple other fixers in my guild only use our NCU buffs when we absolutely need them. Why? Well, here's a script I shamelessly swiped from another person whose name I forget (thanks, btw ):


	Code:
	/ncu
*Thirty Second Warning!* If you want the NCU buff, cancel any running NCU buffs right now and
make sure you have 1 NCU free. This is the only time it will be cast until it runs out.
/delay 10000
20...
/delay 10000
10...
/delay 5000
5...
/delay 2000
3...
/delay 1000
2...
/delay 1000
1...
The reason for this? As you might have guessed and if you didn't know already, the NCU buff is the only buff I know of that can't be refreshed; aka, if it's already running and it's cast again the old nanoprogram won't be replaced with the new longer lasting version. It must be manually canceled to get a new one. And since these are NCU buffs, people are going to want to use that extra NCU for other handy buffs. If you cancel the NCU buff to get a new one, you'll most likely have to cancel other buffs to make room for this one. All in all, a big pain in the ass for the fixer and for his teammates.

Other buffs, as you know, refresh fine when they're recast. Other buffs also refresh when your NCU is "overloaded", or when you're using more NCU than you actually have, such as when an NCU buff runs out or you take NCU chips off of your belt. Why can't the NCU buff work like other nanos? Is there some horrible exploit that would be used if they did?

I would like to use these buffs on a regular basis, but this refresh bug is keeping me and others from doing that. Please fix it!

This quest is broken.

I keep geting the first part, where the reward is the "Banded Ring of Hope", in an area that is inbetween zones. At location 1866,8 - 1207,1 which is just west of the Newland Desert zonewall and east of the Newland zonewall. I can see the hut where the mission is from either side (Newland or Newland Desert), hidden inbetween the zonewalls.

After a petition (which takes forever for "Quest Problems (26)") an Ark decided to teleport me to the right area.
I enter the dungeon and fight my way to the target, who I am supposed to observe. Upon completion the mission doesn't update. It just hands me the ring and removes the quest from my mission list. So when I get to Sarah Winter to deliver the ring she just says she can't take that from me. Presumably because I don't have the quest anymore.

Akagawa @ 12/23/2002 1:51:33 PM (82625):
I think its a bug i've been having the same problem recently.

Akagawa @ 12/23/2002 1:53:31 PM (84014):
This bug killed me about 5 times today. Its a real pain when i'm trying to blitz a mission. I don't think its lag related either. I never had this problem till the last 2 patchs or so.

Akagawa @ 12/23/2002 2:02:50 PM (82753):
One problem if you look at the description it does not say % it just says range increase. The description should say exactly what its adding but its doesnt.

Example:
An engineer is outside a mission.
He casts team beacon warp.
The engineer is now in the middle of a big lake 5minutes NW of where he was before.
The team are scattered accross the zone

Example2:
The engineer casts the nano in a mission
The engineer and the rest of the team are stuck in various walls in the mission.

I think thats the general problem =)

skybert @ 12/23/2002 11:36:55 PM (84014):
Actually rubberbanding has saved my life once.
I was blitzing some stuff, and had managed to gather about every mob in the mission to follow me. I was low on HP and nano. All my layers had been used, and I was certain I would die, when all of a suddon I was warped back four or five rooms. Beeing totally out of range, the mobs lost interrest in me, and I could heal up. The rest of the mission went nicely, because I knew half of themobs was nicely gathered in one corner

Except for that one time, I don't like rubberbanding. Not sure if it's better or worse than black doors, though

MIL @ 12/24/2002 2:29:55 AM (83912):
bump for this being fixed that sounds really ****ty

hope they get that right for the engies 

cuz u already have problems with pet pathing that will prolly be resolved sometime in 2012

ethernal3 @ 12/24/2002 7:16:35 AM (83912):
While you're fixing it, reduce it's cast time too. Unless you have to warp 4 or more people, it's just not worth it.

Thyrfing @ 12/24/2002 9:07:26 AM (82726):
I have Contact Poison and it most definitely is obtainable from normal single-player missions.  Click Saver is your friend.

As for Cracker's Luck, you're mistaken there also.  Most chests require 2x the chest QL in B&E.  If you're short on B&E, using CL or B&E Expertise will allow you to open the chests which would have been 100% failure within a few tries.

Skymarshal @ 12/24/2002 12:35:47 PM (84090):

Honestly though... I am being serious.  I belive there hav been posts about this in the past.

Maybe they figure if we spend the whole time buffing ourselves, we wont fight, and therefore we wont think we're gimped?

Snowbunnie @ 12/24/2002 11:49:27 PM (Team Mission Leaving Bug (in get this there missions) 84527):
First post, but ill cut right to the chase:

Bug:
If the person that rolls the team mission leaves and gives another leader ship and the item that you need to deliver somewhere, then leaves it will not be possible to complete the quest. No one bot the roller can use the mission item on the mission .. "machine"...

Solution:
Everyone in a team can use mission item on mission machine

This game would totally rock, were it not for the many annoying bugs that make me choose the SN that I did. Aside from the losing IP bug(only cuz it has happened only a few times) the bug that really gets me is the backtracking bug. I can walk from point A to point B and it just pulls me back to point A. This makes it EXTREMELY frustrating when trying to get somewhere, or running for dear life and IP. Currently I am stuck in a valley by Stret Wset Bank and have been trying to get out for about a half hour to no avail. I'd like to get back to town so I can save my char before some Omni fool comes along and sticks it to me. Where are the GM's. I used to play Ultima Online and when ever there was a problem I could contact a GM to help me get unstuck or whatever the problem was. Cmon FunCom 13 bucks a month should be enough for you to hire some GM's to help us little guys out there. Sheesh   P.S. this backtracking thing happens when my Ping is 20 too!!! so I know it isn't my connection.

Lhoke @ 12/25/2002 12:21:12 PM (NPC Nukes 84615):
I dont know if this is a temporary bug or whatever.
Today in a mission i got killed by a mob i could not see, looked in all rooms around and still no mobs.. first it hitted me with normal damage and finished me off with a 1.5k nuke.. lost 9m xp, of course.. they could not give it back to me because it was not a server crash, just a bug.. 
In the same mission a friend of mine got killed by a 5k nuke.. in another mission he got killed by a double 3k nuke..
Why did NPCs start nuke and why the ¤#&"#%/ is it so bugged?
A normal 1.5k nuke is not that bad.. but 5k in a ql 179 mission? And a double 3k nuke ? And why cant u guys in FC give back XP that is lost to a bug like that ? Invisible mobs.. great..
"I lost 9m xp to a bug, and all i got was a crappy santa hat from a ARK that could not help me"
Damn... your going to get very unhappy customers if u keep up like this FC...

Stercoral @ 12/25/2002 7:44:43 PM (Show all names - still not working as it should 84675):
Sorry if that was already posted/reposted.

Since the "show org name below nickname" was implemented, the "show all names" is bugged (at least for me).

In the very beginning turning it off was crashing Anarchy within 1 or 2 minutes. That was fixed.

The bug as it is for me today: everytime I log all names are shown even when this feature is turned off in the settings (F10). I have to turn it on then off again to have actually no names showed. And that at every logging.

Let me give you a clue.. Hacked, agent..

Exactly, you hack the blisterpack hoping that your puny crat can use it but it turns out that to use it, you need to be an agent.

I reported this bug to an ark one month ago. I wanna know what is being done about it. This is really one simple bug that you could fix in 5 minutes.

Inocybe @ 12/26/2002 6:44:47 AM (Mobs are chain-casting again 84762):
Noticed this has crept back into missions. 

Here are three (out of several) recent incidents I have encountered: 

* I don't usually die in team missions but last night it happened in a Home mission ... all because the 2 RM Diversionists rooted me REPEATEDLY and so I couldn't move to lose LoS, to use kits, to use button to bail out of the room,  well couldn't do anything to save my butt basically. And of course the mobs were shooting at the same time too. 

* MP mobs in the mission chain-casting Dominate Bio-Met and Nano Shutdown.  Nano Shutdown is 9.30/6.00 secs casting/recharge while Dominate Bio-Met is 6/2.5 secs casting/recharge. Amazing mobs, eh? 

*NT mob chain-casting Electrifying Containment in another mission a couple of nights ago. 

These are what I can recall off-hand at the moment, there were other incidents of course.

Wodin @ 12/26/2002 8:34:14 AM (Issue spending ip points after level with skill window open 84779):
I had just killed a monster and knew i was going to level on his xp so i opened the skill window to spend my ip points. A second after i opened it i leveled. I started to raise my str but the number would not go up. My points did go down but the numbers for str never went up. I also noticed that the bar that represents the skill grew till it filled but the numbers still never moved higher than the starting 79.
I was then able to lower my str to about -20 and then i tried to raise it but ran out of points.
I had done this with a couple other skills but didnt make the changes as drastic as i had with str. I didnt save the changes because i was afraid i was going to end up with -20 str and that could be bad for a Enforcer.
I will try it again when i level to 24 tonight and let you know if i can repeat it.

Wodin @ 12/26/2002 8:41:25 AM (82625):
Same here. I have to wait till i get xp for the kill and then i can attack the next mob.

Chosto @ 12/26/2002 11:59:47 AM (Bugs/annoyances of the new 29500 Yalmahas 84802):
I was finally yesterday able to equip my new and shiny 'Yalmaha - 29500 -The Poniard' and what an anticlimax it turned out to be :/

Bugs: 

- When you enter a shop in them and run out again the Yalm stays equipped but you are still on foot. Same thing with Grid. You have to un-equip it and put it back on again EVERY time (this pisses me off the most)!

- When you un-equip it you character appears high in the air and slightly to the left. You might even end up taking fall damage if the Yalm was not exactly at ground level. 

Annoyances: 

- Dunno if this really is a bug but if wearing some growing Bracers (as i always do) you cannot fit in some shops or whoompas as the dimensions of the Yalm ingrease too. I can do this with the huge Hydro vehicle.

- The turning axis of the new Yalms seems to be at 1/3 in FRONT of the vehicle. So turning with it becomes more 'difficult' than with the old Yalms which behave perfectly. Doing long turns with the new Yalms makes the back of the craft jiggle - looks like my new expensive Yalm is made of plastic or something...


I assume these go with all 29500-model Yalms and not just the Poniard. 

After spending 80k of IP and 50mil of cash on this i find myself using the old Yalm again... Please fix these  

Anyone else found more bugs?

Wodin @ 12/28/2002 6:58:03 AM (84779):
Okay, i was able to reproduce it. Just wait till you have one monster left before you level. When it is about to die, open up the skill window and wait. When the monster dies and you level, you will not be able to assign points properly. 
I will start a level 1 guy and see if i can do it with him and see if the changes i make will stick if i click accept. I havent tried it with my main since i dont want to screw him up.

While I've generaly been  dismissing it as a visual bug, last nite while me and my wife were playing, we killed one of these "air walking" mobs, and were denyed the xp and percentage towards our mission token from this mob.   

This was a building type mission so there were none of the rooms with the green goop (don't get me started on those !!!)

skybert @ 12/28/2002 8:23:30 PM (lag, black doors, warping and rubberbanding. 85351):
Black doors has been a long known problem, which was said to be fixed recently. The black doors has been less and rarer, but the fix brought with it some other things instead.

Massive rubberbanding and lag.

Before I say anything else, let me say this. I'm no whiner. Those who has read my posts before know that. But now I feel I got to vent a little.

I'm just done with a teammission, and it was a terrible experience. I think it's the worst experience I've had in AO ever. Even counting the disconnections during 11.0.

What happened? 
When gridding to the mission area, the grid disconnected some of us when trying to enter it. That has happened alot lately. Never had that kind of problems before, though I've heard about some friends experiencing that.

Anyway, we got inside the mission, buffed up and begun our jurney.  Attacking begun, and the infamous rubberbands made us run through the same rooms over and over and over again all the time. Most of the other people in the team had the same issues I had. Then lag hit us. Combat was initiated, but nothing else happened. We could move about to a certain degree, but unable toa ctually DO anything. No specials, no nanocasting, no sitting down, no nothing.  The fact that the whole team said "lag" in the chat told me that this is not a local issue. If it were, it should theoretically not be possible to happen to six people at the same time, several times.

Also, there is the mob warping. I think that is linked with the rubberbands. But when mobs rubberbands around we tend to call it warping, which is basically the same thing.

I am sorry to say that I am ashamed of playing this.
Today AO has been completely unplayable for me.  Part of our team logged out during the mission because it was simply too annoying, too much lag, too much troggpancherous stuff going on.  The rest of us was determined to at least finish.

When done, we got the old "grid out of here" routine. And guess what happened when I tried to zone..... YUP! Disconnected.

*sigh*

I like playing AO. I really do. But today has been nothing but a bad experience. I cannot play under these conditions.

 - no, I'm not cancelling anything. Just need to vent a little.
Thanks for reading, and also thanks for posting your thought below.

dezibel @ 12/30/2002 9:12:19 AM (Some bugs 85763):
Hi theese are  visual bugs, so i guess they won't be of high priority, but here goes.

Ga + Glasses, skinchip (or any head piece wearable with ga) + opifex (atleast this avartar ) = my hair or threads or whatever and top of my head sticks out of ga looking real ugly.

When wearing Ga , some melee mobs visually/audio hit me every time, i nudge and go ouch every hit, but i ofcourse don't get hit. Other mobs has the correct "svish" sound like they miss me.


Another visual bug, is that my manex doesnt visually fire, i just stand there with the gun idle, while the hits goes on on the chat bar.

Thats it i think

Chebri @ 12/30/2002 8:11:46 PM (84557):
Hello everyone!

Should Funcom read the bugs reported here, I've had the same experience as "mad as hell."  I call it "room hiccups."  I see it mostly in missions.  I get popped back one, two or even three rooms while running through the mission.  This happens whether I'm in a team mission or solo mission.  It does not happen during times of lag - Ping rate is green.  I also noticed that this issue started after the last patch was applied.

I also had an odd situation last night while zoning into Omni-Ent.  My character appeared to have zoned but then I popped back outside and could not move.  Apparently, my character sat down at the portal.  I stood up and was able to zone again.  Another character I was playing with had the same experience but at a different zone (Rome Blue High Rise 7).  If anyone has the same experience, try having the character stand up to see if it helps.

Good Hunting Everyone and Happy New Year!

FR23890 @ 12/31/2002 3:46:50 AM (82625):
This happens sometimes to me when i casted a nano just before the first mob dies, i have to wait till recharge is finished before i can attack the other, if i have a special ready i can land it and so enter the fight if not i have to wait. Sitting down and up fast (double hitting x) works also but if lagging may be even longer than waiting for the heal to recharge.

hashy @ 1/1/2003 3:03:51 PM (72898):
first off: i have no desire to join the tired debate over the effects ga-nukes may or may not have on profession balance; my experience regarding the new nanos has been limited to `you were attacked by nanobots for 5 points of energy damage'. i will, however, say that i have witnessed plenty of fixers with and without grid armor a) be annihilated by nanotechs, and b) dispatch nanotechs with impunity.
*shrug*

the issue of the descriptions for ga-nukes being misleading/non-uniform/whatever is a valid one, but kind of petty.
is it confusing the first time you see it? yes
is it confusing the second time? no
will it be clarified? probably not
technically it could probably be called a `bug', but only one on par with a spelling or grammar error...and fixing these is not exactly funcom's priority or forte (it took them 6 months and 3 tries to spell `nanocluster of suppressive firing' correctly). somehow i don't think changing a few numbers in the description of a confusing nano crystal is on the top of the devs' to-do list.

and btw: quack takes exactly 5 pts of energy dmg when you ga-nuke him. he probably isn't even a fixer.

hashy @ 1/1/2003 3:27:37 PM (67769):
yes and no.
hate is established simply by casting the nano. this is the standard behavior of hostile nanos, and is the source of the problem. i've seen what ino is talking about and it appears to be a timing issue... it looks like the rooting effect and initial aggro are resolved before the `am i in combat' check occurs, which causes the (already broken) `erase hate and cease combat' aspect of the mez to be skipped. (see the nt forum for more comprehensive analyses of the mechanics of mez)
since normal area mez doesn't make the two unconventional checks (outdoors, non-combat) the advy area mez makes,  this flaw in the resolution of its effects never came to light until now (well, until early november at least...)

hashy @ 1/1/2003 3:47:26 PM (80843):
the problem has been here since the beginning: if you use floating panels, the buttons on the team panel shine through other panels, disappear, rearrange themselves, and generally misbehave... now the map buttons do it too and it's starting to get *really* annoying.
(i haven't experienced it when using the panels in gutter-mode but i hate losing the right side of my screen just so that some buttons will behave...)
please fix it.

hashy @ 1/1/2003 3:50:56 PM (80251):

How the hell can i root a mob on it's way to me when instead of running he's warping ?

I just started an agent, bought the 1st root nano and most of the time i can't use it.    I select a mob from the fartest reach of my rifle, hit aimed shot, keep firing while the mob is running toward me, when it reach nano range, hit him with the root.    Sound like a good strategy eh ?   No it's not working !  

 I hit the mob with aimed shot and instead of running to me, he's warping.    Even from 80 yards away, (Not sure the exact range, but at the limit of my rifle) he's at my feet in 1/4 of a second.   How the hell i'm supposed to use my root then ?

Make monster run instead of warp!

Pluteaux @ 1/1/2003 5:39:31 PM (58774):

bump..

Unfortunately I just bought one of these too, I have the same problems that you have.

I want a refund 


Cant zone into missions because the clipping point on teh front of the model is not the same as your character boundry when morphed so it dosent activate the zone when you fly into doorways (whompas too) and when you actually are able to zone it unequips.
I have no VA implants, or buffing items, I have 1 over the VA req for the yalm.. it still needs to be unequipped and re-equiped after every zone..

This has probally be stated but the Damage listed is 1/2 of what the nano acutally does.

Look at the AO database you will see that the GA nuke if used against a GA Fixer Npc would do Dbl Dmg, now please stopy crying.

Who cares?

Uniformity is a must.

I should not have to dig around in a third-party database to find out if the ref of the new chew toy is misleading or plain wrong. It doesn't take a lot of common sense to see the problem here. We need to be able to assume that any given item will follow long-standing rules.

There is at least one mob on Rubi-ka that has been seen to wear Grid Armor, so please don't feed us the 'pvp-only' line. If you want to see it, check out Wailing Waste. I'm not a tour guide, you're on your own. 
			
		
	
The Title of your thread should be "The description feild of the NT GA nuke is wrong" so what they up the damage listed on the description.

problem fixed, now the NT GA nuke does the correct amount of damage listed.

????

i mean do you see the point? there not gonna take it out, its already being used, it would be wrong to remove it from the nt's that went thought the effort or payed the credits to obtain the nano, let this stupid topic die.

I can see the hut where the mission is from either side (Newland or Newland Desert), hidden inbetween the zonewalls.

After a petition (which takes forever for "Quest Problems (26)") an Ark decided to teleport me to the right area.
I enter the dungeon and fight my way to the target, who I am supposed to observe. Upon completion the mission doesn't update. It just hands me the ring and removes the quest from my mission list. So when I get to Sarah Winter to deliver the ring she just says she can't take that from me. Presumably because I don't have the quest anymore.

The Spawn time for the mantis boss in PW used to be 15mins now its set to 45mins. This is very stupid as the change was made with notum wars, probally since theres a base next to it. 


all the other bosses Including the Sandworm, Borgs and Pitlizards(duel boss) have a 15mins spawn time.

Ty for making my adventuer stuff harder to get funcom.

Chosto @ 1/2/2003 11:35:11 AM (84802):
An ARK told me to put a few points more in Veh Air skill to fix the unequip-problem and it worked. I now have 405 base in the skill and the Yalm stays equipped. It would still unequip even if i had 410 with the Aviation sunglasses which give +15 to Veh Air so propably only the base skill is relevant :/
He said it's a bug and they are looking into it.

Wobble @ 1/2/2003 4:05:16 PM (84014):
I've noticed 2 things that increase the likelyhood of rubberbanding in missions. 

It happend to me a lot when :

a) running from a room that is in the corner/edge of a mission level towards the center of the level.

b) passing into/through those large rectangular 'school room' rooms with 2 doors on one wall and one on the opposite one and all the little rows of 'benches' that trap melee mobs so nicely. (not the dark 2 mob rooms)

I hardly ever rubber band when not in one of the above situations.

Sasquash @ 1/2/2003 5:36:52 PM (58774):
I know the quest says it is in Newland Desert, but that doesn't help much when it tries to make me go in an area that is inbetween zonewalls. The location the "Banded Ring" quest is in isn't Newland nor Newland Desert. It is inbetween them. It is just beyond the north east corner of the Newland zone and similary too far into the inverted south west corner of Newland Desert.

I've tried the Clan Party Mixer (500 300, Old Athen East, thank you for the tip Volatus), just east of the wompa. Same result. Also tried to get someone else to take the gloves quest before me, to see if this would give me the other spot, which didn't work.

The "Living Cyber Armor Gloves" quest is bugged.

Guess I'll have to take my chances in the Subway.

FYI.

My yalm req 416 VA , with 416 it deequips, with 417 it deequips, with 418 is stays on  

only problem i have now is the failure to zone into most missions/whompas.

Pluteaux @ 1/3/2003 5:42:53 PM (68495):
Sorry for shouting in the last post. I submitted the post immediately after the boss mob disappeared again. Perhaps I should have waited 5 minutes to cool off. The post did express my feelings at the time, if that is of interest to FunCom.

It occurred to me that the last two incidents may be related to problems I've seen a while back. At least half a dozen times, although not lately, something like the following happened to me. In solo missions, I would be fighting a very tough mob at the mission entrance. Both of us would be near death, I would fire one last shot and immediately leave the mission to heal. Sometimes I would actually see or hear the mob fall down dead as I was leaving. I would heal and come back in, and there would be no corpse. I did not got any xp for killing the mob, there was no corpse to loot, and my probability of getting a token would not increase. Usually I would kill all the mobs left in the mission and see that my chance for a token was between 92% and 97% or so. Once I actually did NOT get a token even though I had killed all the mobs.

So, if the boss mob dies as I'm leaving the boss room, or, if I used a dot, after leaving the boss room, then I may not be getting credit for the kill.

In some of the instances in which the boss mob disappeared on me, however, the boss mob was quite healthy when I left the boss room.

Pluteaux @ 1/3/2003 5:51:52 PM (86345):
What I hate is when I'm easily outrunning a mob slower than me, and he keeps warping to just behind me whenever there is an obstacle, such as slightly uneven terrain, between us. A couple days ago I died because of this.

The next time you try your aimed shot/root strategy, make sure the ground between you and the mob is flat. The more uneven it is, the more likely the mob will warp.

Hypos @ 1/3/2003 7:50:17 PM (86345):
At game launch, mobs did not warp.  Some players figured out there were perches in certain hunting areas where they could go and the mobs would not be able to reach them.  This allowed players to make good xp at no risk to themselves.  FunCom hates that.  Warping was introduced to make sure mobs could always get to you.

Jayde @ 1/3/2003 8:12:05 PM (86345):
The problem is that obstacles are not always the triggering cause of warps.

I was in Mort the other day, outside of Parrot form... I had about 1800 run speed..I got aggroed by both a Greater Anun Slasher and a Large Intestine Horror.

I wasn't buffed, and didn't really feel like fighting them...so I ran off. As SOON as I got out of map range of them, they would teleport right to me.

This was in the middle of the desert... There were no rocks, no obstacles... I was simply way faster than them. And I--a level 163 Adventurer with 1800 run speed--could simply not run away from these mobs. (I cast Parrot after being annoyed for a while, and just flew off.)

I have gone from lvl 90 to lvl125 soloing team missions.Having said that ive only once had a boss vanish .It was when i ran out of firstaid stims and gridded out and returned.So maybe leaving a team mission and returning is the culprit.I'm playing the same way now so im gonna try and recreate this to peg it down.Also 2 patches and 3 borked fixes have occured in that time span.I'm almost sure its the leaving and returning,maybe being the only holder of the team mission has something to do with it as well.


But i have warped down a lvl to heal sometime and returned to boss..he rejuvanated a little but he was the same same.Something you are doing is different...location of missions are they the same?I usually choose missions all over the planet it seems to up the chance of better loot.I Got ga1 and ga2 and nullity 1 this way.And i always use random mission termanals from everywhere as well.I understand your being mad though,trying doing the way i do and see if it stops occuring.

I was so excited to get the pads.  And they're so damn hard to get - but I cringe everytime I do an F8 and see one pad hanging out in front of my left shoulder.  The visual bug really, really, really minimizes and demeans what should be considered a major achievement in AO and turns it into an embarassment and something I'm not quite proud of when in fact I should be. 

I sent a petition and an ARK showed up, he want on explaining that it wasn't considered a high priority?  Now, I have this question - was the AO community screaming for Santa Leets and those useless gifts?  Was the community screaming for silly caps, glasses and arrows????  NO - but all of the Opifex characters want this bug addressed.

Should Funcom read the bugs reported here, I've had the same experience as "mad as hell."  I call it "room hiccups."  I see it mostly in missions.  I get popped back one, two or even three rooms while running through the mission.  This happens whether I'm in a team mission or solo mission.  It does not happen during times of lag - Ping rate is green.  I also noticed that this issue started after the last patch was applied.

I also had an odd situation last night while zoning into Omni-Ent.  My character appeared to have zoned but then I popped back outside and could not move.  Apparently, my character sat down at the portal.  I stood up and was able to zone again.  Another character I was playing with had the same experience but at a different zone (Rome Blue High Rise 7).  If anyone has the same experience, try having the character stand up to see if it helps.

Good Hunting Everyone and Happy New Year!

NeckWringer @ 1/6/2003 1:30:44 AM (Possible Database Bug with Bronto Armor 87698):
Checking statistics on the Carbonium and the Bronto armor and judging by how hard it is to get ahold of bronot pieces to manufacture it I'm assuming that theres a bug on its stats.

Since it uses Stamina and Intelligence as it's stat requirements isn't it supposed to have both a nano pool and a hit point pool additive? It's nano pool additives are similar to carbonium and carbonium has similar AC plus the NCU space and nano init. I can only assume that it was entered into the database incorrectly without the hitpoint modifiers.

NeckWringer @ 1/6/2003 1:38:01 AM (Crit bug with shotguns 87700):
Shotguns are bugged on crits in PVM. They don't crit like other weapons on other characters against very low mobs. It's obviously a bug when a character using implants twice thier level fully draining and crits twice in an hour.

FIX THE BUG!

Pluteaux @ 1/6/2003 3:15:53 PM (68495):
No, loomis, I am not repeating anything as far as mission location or terminal location goes.

I have noticed, in re-reading my posts, that 2 bugs can account for 6 of the 7 times I've had problems. Four times I left the mission and came back in. This seems to be the bug you encountered.

Twice the boss was almost dead when I left the boss level and returned. I suspect that I killed him on the last shot as I was leaving the boss level once. The other time my doc had a couple DoTs on the boss mob and was almost dead when I left the level to heal. He probably died while I was not on his level.

Yesterday I discovered that the bug I mentioned in my last post still exists. Actually it's even more of a problem since v14.7.1: "There’s now a delay after a mob dies before you get XP and looting rights. This is intended." My Enforcer was fighting a tough mob in the first room on the other side of the room from the entrance. I knew he was going to die first, but then I got an add. There was no way I could kill them both, so as soon as the first one died, I ran across the room and exited the mission. I was close to death, but used an Emergency First Aid kit to get back half my health. As soon as the blindness wore off, I re-entered the mission just to loot the body, knowing it probably wouldn't be there since I left the mission before I got the message aboot XP gained and looting rights. Sure enough it wasn't there. So I got no XP, no loot, and no increase in percent chance of getting  a token.

If you leave the mission after killing a mob but before getting the message aboot XP gained and looting rights, you will not get XP, there will be no corpse to loot, and you won't get an increase in percent chance of getting  a token. The same seems to be the case if you kill a mob on one level and leave the level before getting the message aboot XP gained and looting rights. This includes the case in which a mob dies from a DoT while you are on a different level from him.

I have written about this before, merely just repeating myself here. I run the game in 800x600 resolution and sometimes the map arrow/line disappears. This usually happens when I head directly towards a mission in a larger area.

The "line" appears again when I deviate a bit from my course.

Sometimes (not always) the upstairs and downstaris machines are the same stock, but it's worth checking.. 
Find a sup shop a bit off the beaten track, makesure no one is in it, then camp it.  They reset every 2 mins if no one is in them, so you just have to run in, check, run out, wait 2 mins, wipe hands on pants and repeat.

What I've noticed

1) FAR worse on RK1. Happens on RK2 but no where near as much

2) I too have noticed it tends to happen going from corner rooms back into center/main

3) Also happens in stores. This could be an easy one for devs to test on, because its fairly repoducable.

Go into the implant section of a basic Omni supermaket. Go up to the surgery station in the corner. Now turn and run down the wall, turn right through the door, and turn right again as if going into main part of store or back to nanos. BAM! you'll be back at the implant machine. Has happend to me at least 3 or 4 times when doing implants.

There was also a bad warp area in Omni Ent on RK2 one day. Don't know how repoducable it is now. Was trying to get into the flooded section for a mission. Was in sparrow flight and being lazy so just went across the water instead of using a bridge. BAM! All of a sudden I'm back on the edge of the main city, running/flying toward the flooded section. Did this to me 2 or 3 times. I finally changed course and managed to get to the mission.

Kzak @ 1/8/2003 6:43:14 PM (Reclaim/bank backpack bug 88489):
I find that, every time I die or put bags into the bank, their contents are rearranged to a predetermined order - but not the order the items in the bags were when I put them in.

Let's say I end up dead in PvP, and have to collect my items from reclaim. In my tool-backpack, I have a screwdriver in slot 1, a Hacking Tool in slot 2, and a multi-purpose tuner in slot 3 - this is the order I put them in to find things easier. The problem grows worse if you have a lot of items in order in your backpacks.

However, after reclaiming the backpack, I find that the screwdriver has been moved to slot 3, the hacking tool to slot 1, and the tuner to slot 2. This makes for five minutes of extra clicking every time I die, just to put my backpacks into order.

I tried putting my backpacks with the same contents into the bank - but when returning to collect them (not having died), the contents were scrambled as if I had bought the farm.

This is getting to be a little annoying - I'll be happy to work with a bughunter so this problem can be solved, as I think I'm not the only one suffering from this.

It's making it really difficult to blitz missions.  I'm getting quite annoyed with it.  Good thing I'm mostly on RK2.  Played a low level fixer on RK1 and found it to be worse.  Good luck guys.

NeckWringer @ 1/9/2003 2:24:22 AM (Bug with nano programming. 88643):
Here's the bug.

You buy a 125 implant, grab a 136 cluster hand it to someone with a BAJILLION in nano programming and they hand you back a freaking 129 implant and you gotta get another 22 in treatment. 

Im sick of this bug. Fix it. 
STOP the freaking QUALITY creap!!!

Lumin @ 1/9/2003 7:04:00 AM (Yalmaha Bug 88704):
When inside the yalmaha (ie. equipped) and you do ALT+F4 twice and then log back into the game you will appear for evryone else as you where in the size of 20% (as the yalm sizes you to) and flying like quantum wings. even if they zoned inn AFTER you came back online.
on your screen it will look like you are inside the yalm (evrythings normal).
It will go away if you zone or exit the yalm and re-enter it.

EDIT:
Only tested with reg yalm unpainted.

Lumin @ 1/9/2003 7:08:32 AM (88643):
its not a bug, its increasing the quality of the implat due to the superb skill of the tradeskiller. next time get a less competent person to do it

LittleHorror @ 1/9/2003 8:01:09 AM (88489):
Yes i have the same unpleasant thing.

When i get new gear i puth them in backpack in a special order so i know what kind i can use first on top the next one besides it and so on. After i die it's all rearranged so i have to do it again.

Lilcutie @ 1/9/2003 12:44:39 PM (Doctor Team Heals 88755):
This have happened to me more than once;

I join a team, and get kicked from it (no particular reason), then I do a Team Heal. All the (present) members of my "ex-team" gets healed.

This can also be used to exploit (I have never exploited anything), because;
     If a Doctor joins a team outside the lower level-range, and then asks to get kicked from the team, the remaining members can still be healed (Team Heals). AND get Exp. 

My experience is that this only works inside missions (My friend and I tested it, because we wanted to check if it really was a bug, or if we were just lagging).

NOTE: This is a Bug-report, not a "New leveling Exploit".

Kzak @ 1/9/2003 10:15:04 PM (88489):
Over and over and over. Every time I die.

I asked an ARK about this, and she said it wasn't a bug. I claimed it was a bug, otherwise this would be working as intended.. I don't remember if she made a reply to that, but she did agree that it was annoying.

NeckWringer @ 1/9/2003 11:12:29 PM (88643):
Tradeskills should be about getting specific with quality levels.
Let jewelcrafting creep up in quality and even blood plasmaing (which doesnt).

This is dumb. If funcom can't handle game design at this detail level they need to find a better business.

NeckWringer @ 1/9/2003 11:15:51 PM (87700):
Well a targeting scope dropped last night. It's always the person in the team that never loots corpses and asks for the best boss loot that gets it. You think they are going fast looking for good experience but they are looking at the chests. They just dont take the 100 quality armor in there because that is trash compared to what thier mains can provide.

jonelle @ 1/10/2003 3:43:50 AM (85876):
I have and will continue to do a /bug report each time I play AO.  If this becomes a problem then they (FC) need to let me know.

When I complained about the TK spawn to a friend and the fighting that goes on to get him he told that he was told that FC never intended everyone to have the pads.  Also, the pads are something that should be hard to get and considered a great achievement.  So, what I'm hearing is its okay for me to spend time, money and energy trying to get something of importance that really isn't considered important to the people that created them?  

I work for the worlds 3rd largest independent software company and our clients would sue us if we allowed some of the bugs to slip thru QA that FC has allowed.  Did they test the graphic on each race before they went to the live servers?

skybert @ 1/10/2003 7:43:41 AM (88755):
my trader experienced that a long time ago. (some time before the trader teamheals was touched).  I am quite sure I reported it back then. Never really thought about it again. (have barely touched my trader after the teamheals was changed).

so, I guess it's not fixed yet, huh?

Litguy @ 1/10/2003 10:21:45 AM ("legendary" Ring of Power : is this a joke? 89042):
I was doing a team mission tonight and looted a "Ring of Power - Physics" QL 19 which had a very distinguished description and a fairly decent looking result: +3 chem, rad, and (something else) damage ADDED when worn.

I put it on and it did absolutely nothing... at least from the damage logs.  I petitioned a guide and since I was a guide for 6 months in EQ I know when I'm getting the run-around (ie: wait around 15 minutes while a newbie guide asks all the senior guides in guide channel): he had no clue what the item was or what it was supposed to do.  His final verdict: "you are level 21 and it is QL 19 so it doesn't work".  Couldn't help from laughing.

Seems +9 damage add is pretty crazy for QL 19 but considering it is "legendary" and for "omni seniors" I think it's gotta be a bug?

Kzak @ 1/10/2003 11:26:27 AM (89042):
An addendum should go with those rings:

The damage is only added when you have a weapon that deals one of the ring's damagetypes.

E.g. if you use your fists and hit for melee damage, the +3 chemical damage of the ring in the above post wouldn't be added.

Bima @ 1/10/2003 11:31:00 AM (88643):
It isn't a bug, but it does bear discussion yet again.  I myself, as a nanoprogrammer, whined about it in the past.

I find it quite absurd that as a master craftsman with over 1000 in a tradeskill that I have very little control over how the quality of the piece I am working on is improved.  It is incredibly frustrating that I can't meet the desires of my client because I'm too good at what I do.  Ironic, eh?

In one of the previous threads about this issue someone had the clever idea of being able to detune a tradeskill item by one QL at a time with a screwdriver.  That would go a long way toward addressing the complaints.

Hibernation @ 1/10/2003 3:51:30 PM (88755):
I remember when heals made your yalm crash to the ground and so did opening backpacks. So you left a team in pleasent meadows and started to head bacck and suddenly the docs heals start to run on you and you crash, continuosly taking damage until you get out of the yalm or dies.

That was a fabulous experience, especially ig you combine it with coming out of your yalm in an area with red mobs.

So it has been in the game for a very long time if it still exists.

Skyhigh @ 1/10/2003 4:50:00 PM (Refreshing buffs on pet 89118):
That bug is getting real old now.  Can't you just fix it?  I can't imagine why it's not fixed yet.  Has been in the game since release i believe, must not be that hard to fix.   We cannot refresh any buffs on a pet.   We can cast it but the timer do not reset.   We have to wait for the buff to expire to cast it again.

Fix tha plz.

Anarchin @ 1/10/2003 5:44:17 PM (84014):

Jynne @ 1/10/2003 9:43:22 PM (89042):
Furthermore... the damage add is one of the last things included in the damage calculation... so if your normal hit is for 10 poison damage, the ring would make it 13.  If it was for 100 poison damage... it would make it 103.

Meurgen @ 1/11/2003 1:21:25 AM (Getting sick of supression gas change effects on actions in PvP. 89270):
This thread contains a bit of good info on the subject. Read it please. 

Absolutely sick and tired of the crippled nature of pvp right now due to the recent changes in the rules regarding supression gas changes during fights. I realise that these changes were implimented with regards to tower battles, mainly the change of a bases supression gas, and the disgrace period when leaving a 25%/5% base, but the end result is that pvp anywhere but towers has been completely crippled to the point of near uselessness.

To sum it up: Nearly every fight in the Arenas, Meetmedere, and Camelot involves at some point one or more characters crossing from one supression gas level to another without zoning *while attacking or under attack.*

Current bugs associated with this are:


       A character who is attacked in a 25% area who steps into a 75/100% area without first initiating an attack on his/her agressor will remain under attack, but not be able to retaliate in any way. Pets will not follow an order to attack, guns will not fire at all (including specials), and hostile nanos can not be executed.


        If two characters attack each other in a 25%/5%/0% area and both cross into a 75%/100% area during the fight, there is a large chance (it follows rules, but I haven't seen any documentation of the exact guilelines) that neither will be able to cast nanos, or use weapons specials, or order pets to attack yet both will continue to attack with their normal fire of their weapons. This puts any nano profession, and any pet profession at a severe disadvantage. This does not uniformly affect both fighters. In many cases one will be able to continue using nanos and specials and pets, and the other will not. This is generally what happens when:

Two characters initiate an attack in a 25%/5%/0% area, then one character stops his attack and moves into the higher supression gas. The result is that the character now in higher supression can re-initiate an attack with full use of nanos, pets and weapon specials, and the person in the 25%/5%/0% zone is completely unable to respond with anything other than normal weapon attack (not specials).


I dunno about any of you, but especially as a pet user, this bug is driving me up the wall. It completely cripples any meaningful pvp in the majority of the game's pvp capable zones. Bump 'til the devs get this fixed.

The Validator @ 1/11/2003 1:57:28 AM (Can't trade from Container 89274):
Please fix that one..what a pain

Ratty @ 1/11/2003 3:16:49 AM (87408):
They should fix any bugs with that thing, but i highly recommend one of the player created chat clients.
In my opinion, this one is best:

http://mockers.net/aorc/

Supports item refs, private chat groups, and lots of stuff you cant do on that web chat thing.

Ratty @ 1/11/2003 3:27:13 AM (I got looted after /terminate 89293):
I was teamed with a friend in the subway, so after awhile I decided to /terminate so I didn't level past 24. So there was some xp to be lost, but really not that much, maybe 5-10% of a level if that.
I ran /terminate.
My friend was able to loot half my backpacks in my inventory. He gave them back, but it was kinda scary to think about.
My main doesnt have any warping ability so the reclaim express is how I get back to town after doing raids or whatever, I would hope that I dont have to go hide somewhere before /terminate for fear of being looted.

I figure I'll post this bug here, if someone puts it into a buglist that gets worked on, great, if not, i've already long come to accept AO as being buggy, so what's one more to the pile.
But just lookout guys, I dont know if its just teammates that could loot, or if it was because I lost a tiny bit of xp, or what triggers this, but in any event, BE CAREFUL WHEN USING /terminate.

Ratty @ 1/11/2003 3:32:00 AM (86713):
I know the order of things in backpacks, and in bank is all client side.. Just to lookout for yourself, you could make a copy of the Prefs folder and restore it if necessary.
I just gave up on it keeping the order of things in backpacks long ago, as long as the bags are in inventory it seems to keep them intact.

Ratty @ 1/11/2003 3:33:05 AM (89274):
(yet)
And how long's it been? I'd like to know how long (yet) is. 
Seems to be just mission reward loot too that does this for who knows what reason.

Ratty @ 1/11/2003 3:34:15 AM (88489):
Maybe this is intentional to make dying that much more annoying and something you want to avoid?

Kzak @ 1/11/2003 1:48:03 PM (86713):
This also happens - to me, at least - when I collect my backpacks from reclaim. All the things I've carefully put in order for easy access (medsuit, tradeskill-implants, buff-items) for everyday use are jostled about and put into a predetermined order - but what that order is based upon I have no idea about.

Kzak @ 1/11/2003 1:55:51 PM (Pets affected by PvP level schemes 89409):
Something most annoying I found, and likely others have found before me:

Pets - be they bots or MP demons/meatballs - are affected by the level limits. For instance, if your pet is level 200, and you are a level 125 MP - if you're attacked by a level 125 agent, your pet will refuse to help you out. Only if your opponent is in acceptable level-range of your pet will it attack.

A bug - another bug, rather - which must be fixed.

shopmule @ 1/11/2003 4:04:54 PM (89270):
Yes this is an unwanted and highly exploited bug.
Players have always tried to gank you and if it didn't go their way they would try to run to the door and zone. It used to be they had to risk becoming rooted and dealt with but now they just stop attack and run away calmly.

Please fix this it is boring as and cheap as hell.

rdelambert @ 1/11/2003 8:03:55 PM (35110):
Oh yes, this is one of my "favorite" features of the game.  

Solo mission -- Engineer.  
Server crashes.
Relog.
Random room, MOBs restored.
Before I can even stand up -- White screen -- Reclaim terminal.

At least weapon-users are still armed when you reappear; pet users are unarmed.

Maybe it can be worked after the black doors/rubberbanding.  They are even more annoying to everybody.

Meurgen @ 1/11/2003 8:19:58 PM (89270):
Another bug associated with it:

Roots and snares aren't considered hostile nanos. It's possible to walk into the arena and root someone, and your grace period will not end. You can walk out and they'll be stuck there trying to kit off their roots. Another cheap new method of ganking. I don't mind the ganking folks, but I'd like ways to fight back against it.

Usually it's a driver issue when that happens. Try updating your video drivers to the latest version (or refreshing them if you have the latest version).

After that, you could try changing the system font from the login page. It's somewhere under the "Settings" button where you put in your account info

Suits like Omni-Tek Suit and Omni-Tek Armor. If you put it on, and then zone, its gone. You are still wearing it, but it does not show.

It will just look like you are wearing your regular armor. And if you then take it of, it will look like you are naked.

Not an important bug, but still a bug.

Sometimes when my 'zone map'(the one with the 3 new buttons from Notum Wars on the bottom) isn't up but my 'wear' (the one with Weapon, clothes, and Implants) is; I get a problem.  I try to take off my pants and it makes one of the new Notum Wars buttons appear and activate instead.  The only way I can fix this is by opening my 'zone map' so the new buttons show then take off the clothes.

Please do something to fix this problem.

There is hope for our survival.

This time, when I could get back in, the mission was in the same state as it was when it crashed.  That is, the MOBs didn't respawn and I was in the same room.

It's all still magic to me (and I've been in and around the computer business for over 30 years now).

Dont set your expectations too high. Remember there are two ways to crash: server and client crash.

Server crash resets the mission/play field.

Client crash just disconnects you and the mobs probably kill you while still in game.

Both ways you will reenter where you left.

There is a bug that means that when you trade an item with someone, it become invisible to that person until they zone.

It might be me, but it seems to happen most often in stores (though this is normally where I give/get given items)

It is a real pain for making implants/nanos/weapons etc.

Came back today and was hunting cyborgs and after 2 hours, *poof* there went GA which left me naked.  I died faster than I could get an evac out, resulting in 2/3rd of a level xp loss.

Just a heads up that server downtime for maintenance might do this to whatever critical nano you have running at the time.

To make a long story short I was soloing borgs in PW and moving along nicely considering my lvl but at long last I ran into a problem with a cyborg general....this one happened to like specials a lot during th course of the fight I was burst 3 times for 1.2k ok that's annoying but I can deal with those.....The real problem was that I only have 4.5k hp and well let me tell u what the last 4 hits on me were you'll get the idea.....1287 burst, 341 norm, 432 norm, 7788 full auto= -5,382,820 xp and hello reclaim.
Obviously this is a bug I was told so when I petitioned about the completely harsh way I lost my xp and it needs a patch to be fixed. Ok great it needs a fix I haven't seen or heard from anyone at all that this is a problem if they're working on a fix for it that would imply that it's a known problem would that be correct?
I guess in part I want to complain/warn anyone who hunts borgs they fight dirty and and also to warn that if u lose xp don't bother petitioning about it won't do u any good and will serve nothing more then to irritate you. I am curious tho why if FC is planning on fixing something that they know is broke why not post that on the main page? I don't feel like digging through a forum for 5 hours looking for tidbits of info just so I can avoid bugs :/
also like to add this is the last time I will ever send a petition for anything sad to sad they have been no help whatsoever at all in far too long for me to bother anymore.
 I am curious if anyone else has had this problem lately at all lately plz feel free to post thoughts and yes i'm mostly complaining in this post because there is no reason that couldn't be posted on the loggin page or something or for that matter why my xp couldn't be returned


ok maybe it's not so short

Drsepsis @ 1/16/2003 2:10:47 AM (Base Attack Alert System 90835):
In the past two days my guilds towers have been attacked and we have received NO notice over either the All Towers chat or the Org Tower chat.  In fact the only warning we recieved was when the attackers attacked a personal tower of someone who was on at the time and they got a note that their Tower was at 50%.  

For my guild (right now) its really not that big of a deal cause our base is easy to replace and no guild that takes it will hold it for more then a few days but i'm sure for high lvl towers this is a VERY expensive and time consuming venture.  

The ARK i talked to suggested it was an exploit but i think it has something to do with the code for the shield Negator.  The one and only time we have EVER recieved a warning was when they used a shield negator.  I don't know for sure but that is my thought.

And yes before anyone asks i do have my All towers, Clan leaders chat, guild chat, and org tower chat all enabled so i should see something if it were to happen and i do see messages when other guild's towers are attacked.

Anyone else had this problem?

Queenblade does Chemical Damage

Maybe this was intended, but I think that 2 weapons coming from the same type of mob should have the same type of damage, which I think should be poisen anyways.

KrazyKanuck @ 1/17/2003 9:52:37 AM (Engie nano bug 91284):
Had this happen to me a few times and saw it happen to a couple more engies over the last few days.  I think its funny as hell but to the people who die and looose their xp i guess it would not be as funny and could possibly be used to grief people.

Anyways here it goes.  When you have the intrusive aura of entanglement or any of the other nanos from that line running on your pet.  Happens when you die/terminate/end up at reclaim.  If the aura ticks while your bot is in limbo(when it is brought back to reclaim for you but is still searching for its master) everyone in the area who has auto attack for PvP on will immediately be brought to attack the bot.

so now all these people who are sitting there have had the bot attack them and have aggro'd the bot.  No thats not the problem.  the problem is when the bot finds this owner.  The guards of the local area see that all those players are attacking the bot which belongs to the engie again and come to the aid of the engie and his pet killing everyone who was formerly attacking the engie pet.

I just saw this happen again at tir south gate which is what made me think to write this.  Saw the engie come back to reclaim and his bot pop up.  then suddenly all this red test as me and a bunch of other people aggro'd the bot.  Of course i knew what has happening and immediately hit esc and headed for the zone.  but unfortunately there are alot of people who didn't recongnize what was happening and got killed by the guards.  There were alot of WTF's going around on org chat and at tir gate there for awhile.

Its pretty funny when you think of it.  A engie who couldn't hurt a fly in PvP causing such massive death and destruction unintentionally in a 75% gas area  oh the irony.

Ghostimage @ 1/17/2003 12:55:12 PM (90808):
6500 Full Auto from a Cyborg General in PW sent me back to reclaim minus 2.5million xp. It was his opening shot too 

I don't think FA should be removed - but maybe it should cap at 40% like PvP - still makes it a dangerous special for the borgs but removes the "one shot kill" aspect.

I'd disagree with the comments about petitioning in general though. I didn't petition this (I treat it as part of the game really - gets too boring if nothing can kill you ) But for other important issues I've had a rapid and friendly response from both ARKs and even a GM once

Ghostimage @ 1/17/2003 1:06:38 PM (80843):
Yep me too, again thought I was the only one suffering this so never mentioned it before

Ghostimage @ 1/17/2003 1:10:28 PM (90835):
I believe you don't get a warning that your towers are attacked if you're in a "state of war" ... i.e. A member of your guild has attacked someone elses towers. Could be one of your members is attacking other peoples towers on a frequent basis?

Inconvenience @ 1/18/2003 12:49:19 AM (86345):
Even if there were "exploiters" using terrain to their advantage. (I guess a deerstand would be illegal if funcom ran the government of a country) This is far to hamfisted a solution.

This makes the vast majority of those who enjoyed outdoor hunting suffer for the powerleveling of a few. I'm about as mad as I can get about a game because of this. 

I have a mid level (143) NT and (95) Fixer and wanted to try out an advent. I leveled my advent up to around 20. One day I was fighting a group of outdoor mobs and started to feel I was losing so I decided to use one of my cool abilites to turn into a reet and outrun them. Well I easily outpaced them and would have escaped had they not warped whenever I got a certain distance from them. Then each of them got a "free" hit. Wash and repeat and I'm at reclaim. If a frickin adventurer and can't use my abilities to survive in the outdoors? Then what's the point?

This is a terrible decision funcom. Reverse this to the way it was, there are far more people who want to have fun outdoors than ones wanting to use some sort of exploit - though I can't see using terrain to your advantage as one.

Urshulgi @ 1/18/2003 11:03:25 PM (90808):
I'm not saying nothing should kill me but gettinghit for twice my absolute maximum hp is BS. capping it at 40% of ur max life would help a bit let's face it if ur soloing borgs 40% of ur life means your gonna die.

and as far as getting a quick response after a petition I have gotten maybe 2 in the very long time i've played and as far as getting anything resembling help or even a straight answer nvr the petition function is useless if no one who answers can/will help you for all the use it is it should be removed wouldn't notice a difference

At least now you can petition, and in theory they can check to see if indeed the mission crashed, and refund xp. I've yet to have a mission crash on me in many many months, but when it happens I'll be petitioning to test this new policy out.

Devestior @ 1/19/2003 6:08:09 AM (943):
Anyone else notice that the fix for Q Q Q Sledgehammers makes it unfair for everyone else?

Do you have to sit there, not being able to attack, until the mobs hit you a few times and auto-attack turns on? Making breaking entry rooms a severe pain in the rump?

Perhaps its just me - perhaps not, but just curious if anyone else notices this.

LittleHorror @ 1/20/2003 7:43:24 AM (89637):
I think it's also very important to put into your post the save terminal that gave the problem so Funcom can take a look at it.

63sg @ 1/20/2003 10:35:45 AM (86345):
This makes roots, snares, ground vehicles, and run speed totally useless outdoors.  My first adventurer with reet form could travel any where back in the day along with my engy and his Kodaik, now thats impossible.  Using a snare to escape is useless because the mobs are right on top of you as soon as you get a good distance away.  Using root and shoot tactics is useless too because as soon as the root wears off that mob is going to be right on top of you.  I could see having the mob warp a few feet if theres an obstacle in its way keeping it from chasing me down but not warping right on top of me.  Thats unfair for the player and takes the fun out of outdoor hunting.

i think all mobs got specials, if you keep your evades up, you are seldom hit by those thought

DaveDread @ 1/20/2003 12:22:49 PM (90808):
Evades dont affect specials at all. You can have 1000000000 in evade ranged and a flingshot will still hit. Get an engie special-blocking buff thou, that might help.

The level range of healing and buffing in land control battles follows the PvP level rules; if you can attack somebody of a given level, you can heal and buff somebody of the same level.
			
		
	
This doesnt seem to apply to Meta-Phys's healing pets.
I as lvl 181 cant heal that poor lvl40 clanner fighting the big bad omnis while the lvl 200 MP can put his healingpet on one of the level 40 omnis.

Is it supposed to be this way?

Urshulgi @ 1/20/2003 10:36:48 PM (90808):
well the engi special buff would be nice but i'm a soloing fixer so not an option 

and no i'm not a GA fixer either I wear armor and can still solo lvl200 borgs  can do medusa too but they hit a lot harder......they don't have full auto tho so might be a better option......

Bionitrous @ 1/20/2003 10:39:16 PM (90808):
MOB specials also don't check LOS like normal shots.  If I'm not mistaken, they also let loose with them while they are running.  Got me dead a couple times from Burst and FullAuto from a MOB who's two rooms back in a mission.

Im soloing a team mission in the longest road.My att is 978 fully buffed.when i go down an elevator my attack drops to 933.I have to recast any buff stam, strg,quickness dosn't matter,to get my original att back.It dosn't seem graphical because my damage dealt to mobs is less as well,not by much but some.Please look into this.


Just reproduced it several times its there and constant.

Drsepsis @ 1/21/2003 6:17:19 AM (90835):
None of the times we have been attacked like this have we been "at war" so i think that labels it out.  I still don't know how this would classify as an exploit...its more likely a fact of the shield and shield negators not working completely right.

Hypos @ 1/21/2003 7:29:27 PM (92455):
The heal range problem definitely does apply to MP pets.  There've been discussions over on that forum about the problem.  Often, the pet will even refuse to heal the master because of this.

I can think of 2 things that might enable the level 200 MP to heal the level 40 char.  First, he may have been using a QL40ish heal pet - heal range for the heal pet seems to be determined by the QL of the pet instead of the level of the master.  Second, the level 40 char could have been teamed with someone much higher level - the heal/attack range appears to be determined by the highest level person in a team.  So, if the level 40 had been teamed with a level 150, then a level 200 char could heal him.

Overall, the system still seems really buggy.

Urshulgi @ 1/22/2003 7:04:27 AM (FC's lack of effort in fixing bugs is truly amazing..... 92941):
First off i'd just like to ask a rhetorical question.
How is that nothing has been fixed in god knows how long?

Ok i'm going to make a list of some of the major issues in game that FC has done nothing about(they seem to be doing a whole lot of nothing recently)
1.This has got to be the rubberbanding issue it's been going on for far too long and every time I ask about it I either get the runaround from someone or I get n00b ark who wouldn't know what to say to give me the runaround which is getting fairly annoying at this point just ONCE i'd like a straight answer but that's being hopeful.........

2. How about not being able to cast nano programs because for some reason the server is lagging behind and still thinks your trying to cast an old prog and won't let you cast a new prog found a couple diff ways this one works but in the end u still get the same result(you tend to die)

3. How bout grid/zone crashing I know lots of ppl who have been having this problem and the sad thing is it can happen when u have a 20 ping and don't know what the word "lag" means

4. HP bar bug. really annoying when someone dies in ur team and for all anyone else knew they were at full health the entire time

5. mobs having the ability to insta kill yet again........

6. can't think of one for #6

7. buffs not being taken into account after zoning. I petitioned about this one a while ago got an ark who didn't believe me :/
but every time I zone I have to fully rebuff or i'm at a negative to all skills I normally buff no idea why but for some reason they aren't being taken into account after zoning like what used to happen to duel wielders where all buffs etc weren't checked when zoning and thier weap would drop to inv only the buffs aren't being accounted for in this case period

8. why does it takea manex 20s to reload? curious if that's a bug or intended the weap is slow enough as it is w/o the hideous reload time

9. not a bug but why does every ark have to act like he owns AO and all things in it inculding you? this is just a straight complaint they are volunteers and i'm tired of trying to be nice to these ppl they don't answer questions do to lack of information and are increasingly rude. imho if u disagree......oh well


anyway that's all I can think of i'm curious what all I missed plz post others here so nothing suprises me

and if I looked I could find these already posted about i'm sure but having my own post to check is more convenient then searching threads for an hour

Chaosengine @ 1/22/2003 11:31:48 AM (84014):
Bump !

Nothing worse than doing a mission, solo, group or otherwise, to find yourself being ported back into a room where a Real Mean Torpedo is waiting to say hello in only the way he knows.

Sort it out!

Phoxtrot0 @ 1/22/2003 12:36:47 PM (Lost items when logging off inside mission 93016):
I was soloing a huge team mission when the mission timed out.

I realized i was sleepy and since there was no more urgency to get to the boss, I found a quiet round and loggued off.

About 36hours later, I relogued into the game.

My character was sitting outside of the mission area, just in front of the entrance (no longer possible to enter of course, that is to be expected).

The problem is that ALL the items I had gained in that huge mission were lost except for one single item I had actually equiped.
Thats was at least 25 items. Including cloaks and other somewhat valuable items (no VERY valuable one though).

I petitioned of course but there wasn't any GM online.
(Note : there wasn't any GM online either 2 days before when I was running on red tiles labelled "ERROR"...)
No object in reclaim, nothing solved by zoning.

Can I hope for some kind of refund/compensation for the items ? I don't expect to get the items back especially since I can't possible give their names and QL but still... The lot should have fetched around 400k which is quite some money for me.

I hope this post can warn other players about the problem...

Phoxtrot0 @ 1/22/2003 12:43:29 PM (92455):
For this as for the attacking range of pets, I strongly believe that the PvP range of the pet should be the same as the range of the master.

If a level 80 MP use a QL50 pet, the range of that pet should be the appropriate range for a lev80 player.

You can use any QL of weapon if you meet the reqs, why can't we have the same for pets ?

Of course, this should be reciprocated. Other players can attack your pet if they can attack you.

The one problem with this is that in order for all things to be smooth, the opponents should be able to see easily which pets they can target.


Note : selfless post, haven't done any PvP yet.
